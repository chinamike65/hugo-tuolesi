TREASURES OF THE Dharma Ocean (6)

Ngawang Gyatso Vajra Guru Prayer


#### Introduction to Ngawang Gyatso Vajra Guru

Master Ngawang Gyatso was born on March 3, 1969 (the fifteenth day of the first lunar month) in Hainan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Qinghai Province.

The master began to practice Buddhism as a novice monk at the age of six, and became an ordained monk at the age of eighteen. He studied with Dharma Master Lama Yong Zeng, Geshe Rinpoche, Lobsang Dorje Vajra Guru, Gejia Rinpoche, Dharma Master Yeshe Gyatso, Gazang Qusong Vajra Guru and the 10th Panchen Lama.

Master Ah Wang, having followed the precepts of his teachers, received complete transmission of the teachings from his seven masters, the forty-sixth generational heirs of the "Perfection of Wisdom Sutra", the most important classic of Buddhism. From them he obtained more than 200 kinds of empowerments, more than 300 advanced special empowerments, more than 280 guiding precepts, with more than 500 scriptural sutras and more than 80 oral transmissions of intangible secrets. Therefore, the lineage of the master's doctrinal transmission is extremely complete and especially rare.

His Holiness Dharma Master Yongzeng, who was once the sutra teacher of the living Buddha, Sechi, in Lamodeqin Monastery was a person of superior virtue and the complete holder of the transmissions of the Gelugpa tantric teachings. Master Ah Wang studied with Master Yongzeng for more than 20 years and absorbed all of the wisdom and experience of the Venerable Dharma Master. The other six masters are also highly proficient in the esoteric secrets and have sufficient evidence of exceptional scholarly achievements. 

In addition, Master Ah Wang studied at Qinghai Buddhist College and the Ta'er (Kumbum) Monastery Debating College of Dialectics (Debating College).
With a single-minded commitment to study and wide erudition, he completed the study of sutra and tantra, the five major theories of the five great Dharma masters, well ahead of schedule.

Since graduating from Qinghai Buddhist Academy and Ta'er Monastery Debating Academy with excellent grades, the master has been living at Qinghai Tuole Monastery, serving as the Vajra Guru and the abbot of the monastery. He teaches the monks of Tuole Monastery every day in groups: lectures on the five traditional monastic subjects, the "Three Principal Aspects of the Path", and the four classes of tantra, and has set up a new sutra debating school at the monastery.

Master Ah Wang has now produced several batches of lamas with a Geshe degree (equivalent to a Ph.D. in Buddhism).

The master also insists on going into retreat for two months every year.

Lama Yongzeng once told Master Ah Wang: "Your whole career in this life is to turn the wheel of Dharma widely and spread the Dharma for the benefit of all living beings."

Master Ah Wang often gives sermons, teachings, lectures, and holds empowerment ceremonies in both Tibetan and Chinese areas, and often holds patriotic teachings, and patriotic activities in monasteries, making due contributions to the promotion of social harmony and stable development.

At the invitation of believers from other places, the master has travelled all over the world to teach the sutras and the Dharma to those who are destined to hear them.

In 2009 and 2014, invited by the Buddhist community in Macau, the master, as a representative of Tibetan Buddhist monks, presided over the Puja for the 10th and 15th anniversary of Macau's return to the mainland.

In October 2015, the master was also invited to participate in the 2015 Chongsheng International Forum co-organized by the Yunnan Buddhist Association and the Dali Chongsheng Temple.

Master Ngawang is not only perfect in his practice and perfect in his eloquence, but he is also the author of a rich collection of writings.

The Master's writings include Commentary on Philosophy, Commentary on the Diamond Sutra, Dictation from the Three Masters of the Three Paths and Three Schools, Vajrasattva Ritual and Practice, and Dakini Mother of Buddha Ritual, Tracks and Practical Practices, Practice of Retreat, Simmering Sang Ritual, Biography of Vajra Guru Gazang Qusong, History of Tibetan Buddhism, Dabao Motto, Nectar Dharma Rain, Tantric Buddhism Feng Shui and the "Dharma Ocean Treasures" series (this is the third volume), etc.

The master's writings are concise and comprehensive, and the analysis is profound and thorough, and has been praised and acclaimed by many great scholars in Buddhist circles at home and abroad.

Master Ah Wang once studied under the 10th Panchen Lama, who is deeply loved by the people. The Panchen Lama was called "a great patriot and an outstanding leader of Tibetan Buddhism" by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and made many important contributions to Buddhism in China.

Master Ah Wang was deeply influenced by the Panchen Lama. In his religious thought, he advocated that Buddhist disciples should be concerned with the common people, cherish the "Three Great Loves" and practice the "Four Practices" in order to achieve the harmony and perfection of the "Five Vows".

"Three Loves": patriotism, love for the people, and love for education.

"Four Practices": take self-purification as the foundation, take altruism as the principle, take harmony as the spirit, and take enlightenment as the goal.

"Five Wishes": Great social harmony, great national unity, great national prosperity, great world peace, great perfection in practice.

Under the leadership of Master Ah Wang, the Sangha of Tuole Monastery adheres to the rule of the Gelug School. The results are among the best. Master Ah Wang said that it does not matter if we are talking about Southern Buddhism, Chinese Buddhism or Tibetan Buddhism, they are all Buddha's Dharma, and they are all very special.

Buddhists should go deeper into the scriptures, diligently study and think, and establish a right view. At the same time, it is necessary to develop Bodhicitta widely and truly think for the sake of all sentient beings, in order to achieve a perfect life for oneself and others.

##### Chapter 1 - Brief Biography of Buddha Shakyamuni

Sakyamuni is the founder of Buddhism. His surname is Gautama, his childhood name is Siddhartha. Sakyamuni is a family caste. The meaning of the saint of the Ka tribe.

Siddha became proficient in 64 arts over the years. He became a monk at the age of 29, and at the age of 35, on the evening of April 14, he subdued all demons.

Therefore, the fifteenth day of the fourth lunar month is the  day of Buddha Shakyamuni's enlightenment.

Forty-nine days after Sakyamuni became a Buddha, he started to turn the Wheel of Four Noble Truths at Varanas on the fourth day of the sixth month of that year; then, on the fifteenth day of the third month of the following year, he turned the Wheel of Formless Dharma for the second time at Ling Vulture Mountain.

At the age of 47, he turned the wheel of Falun three times in Fawbajin and other places, and taught the method of righteousness but not righteousness.

Buddha preached sutras for 47 years in his life, and saved countless sentient beings. On April 15, when he was 81 years old, he passed away in the city of Kusinagar.

Section 1 Birth and Boyhood
More than 2,500 years ago, on the eighth day of the fourth lunar month, Sakyamuni was born in the Lumbini Garden in ancient India, now in Nepal.

His father, King Jingfan, was the king of Kapilavastu, who was very wise and benevolent. His mother, Madam Maya, was a princess of Koli, and she was very wise. When she was forty-five years old, she conceived a prince.

The birth on June 15th, and the birth on April 8th of the following year. Tibetan Buddhism believes that it was born on April 15th, and Buddhist scriptures record that it was born on the full moon day.

After the prince was born, he could walk seven steps around, and seven lotus flowers appeared at the foot of his feet. Then, he looked around, pointed to the sky with one finger, and pointed to the ground, and said to himself: Heaven and earth, I am the only one.

According to Buddhist scriptures, the gods of the thirty-three days, including the Great Brahma, were overjoyed when they heard that the prince was born, and came to the world to bathe the prince.

Parents were overjoyed to have a child in their later years, so when the prince returned to the palace, the whole country celebrated.

At this time, there was a high-achieving Brahmin named Asida. He said: The prince has a dignified appearance. If he can become a monk in the future, he will definitely become enlightened; if he is at home, he will definitely become a wheel-turning holy king.

The Holy King of Wheel Turning is the great king who rules the whole world. After listening to this, the King of Pure Rice placed very high hopes on the prince. Therefore, he named him Siddhartha, which means auspiciousness and the achievement of all merits. I hope that the prince will become a prince in the future. Wheel King.

In order to prevent him from becoming a monk, the king of Jingfan was very strict with the prince, so there were many obstacles in the cause of the prince's monkhood.

Seven days after the birth of Prince Siddhartha, his mother died and was brought up by his aunt, Mahapajapati, who loved the prince as her own son.

At the age of seven, the prince began to read, and the wise prince knew everything, and when he was twelve or three years old, he knew everything.

Later, he learned the art of war and martial arts, and he became proficient quickly. In a competition of royal children, he performed outstandingly. The best of the princes could shoot through three drums with one arrow, but the prince could shoot through seven drums with one arrow in a row.

When he grew up, his father let him marry, and he married Yasodhara, the princess of a neighboring country.

King Jingfan very much hoped that the prince would inherit the throne, so he built three palaces for him, namely Han, Shu, and Wen, and selected many palace maids to serve him, so that he could live a happy life.

However, the prince was not interested in the wealth and happiness of the world.

3

Section 2 ordination and spiritual practice
Prince Siddhartha was very dissatisfied with the caste class inequality in India at that time, and he often wondered: Why was Sudra a slave? Are they not human? Is there any way to let them live a free and equal life?

Once, Prince Siddhartha went to the mountains with his father to play. He saw several farmers ploughing the fields. They had no clothes on their upper bodies.

The necks of the oxen were strangled with ropes, and their skins were bloodied. They were also whipped by the farmer. Many small insects were found in the plowed soil, and the birds immediately flew over to peck them.

Seeing this scene, the prince developed a strong compassionate heart. In order to survive, the poor are so miserable, and the animals are killing each other. He leaned against a big tree and quietly thought: How should we help them so that they can live a happy life? ?

Later, when the prince traveled to the four cities, he encountered four painful events of birth, old age, illness, and death, and saw the happy expression of a monk.

The prince thought about it over and over again and realized that no one can escape the four kinds of pains of birth, old age, sickness and death. Besides, in order to survive, all living beings have to commit all kinds of evil things, even killing each other, causing all kinds of tragedies. go in the direction.

4

This tragic life is full of contradictions. How to get rid of this unreasonable life?

These problems made it impossible for the prince to live in the palace and enjoy himself with peace of mind.

At the age of 29, the crown prince finally made the greatest determination, gave up the throne, wealth, parents and wife, took a waiter called Che Ny, rode a white horse, and secretly left the palace, crossed the Anama River, and went to the deep mountains and wilderness. To seek ways to escape suffering and truths of life.

Finally, under the protection of his own vows and the four kings, he became a monk on the eighth day of the second lunar month.

After the prince decided to become a monk, he shaved his hair by the Anama River, put on a dung-sweeping robe, and asked Che Ni to bring his original crown and white horse back to the palace.

When King Jingfan saw Che Ny coming back, but he did not see the prince, he immediately sent his ministers to chase him.

However, the prince's will to become a monk was very firm. He said to the ministers who came after him: If I don't realize the truth, I will never return to the palace.

The king had no choice but to choose five young adults from his relatives to follow the prince to practice, serve and protect the prince.

The prince led everyone to continue to the wilderness and entered the ascetic forest of Bajiaxian. He saw those ascetic practice all kinds of asceticism for the sake of survival. He felt that it was not the right way and wanted to leave. The ascetic saw that his practice was very firm and told him to go to Heng The ascetic forest on the south side of the river went to look for a famous teacher, so the prince continued southward, crossed the south bank of the Ganges River, and reached the country of Majiduo, where he begged for food in the city of Wangshe.

5

At this time, King Pinbharata knew about it and rushed to Banda Baram to meet the prince. He asked him to enter the palace to provide food and drink, and to give him the throne. He also gave him half of the land and property to persuade him to return to the secular world.

But the prince was firm in his will and refused to accept it. King Pinpo Sara admired it very much and said to the prince: If you become enlightened, don't forget to save me.

The prince said: "Your Majesty, I will definitely do what you want.

So he said goodbye to King Pinbharata, and continued to look for a famous teacher in the direction of the Ascetic Forest.

The prince and his five attendants went on a journey to pursue the truth, and visited the famous masters of the time, Arara Kalama and Utta Kalama.

However, the prince felt that their theories were not satisfactory and could not satisfy the desire for liberation, so he left them and continued to search.

In the village of Uru-Vela near the Niren Chan River, the prince lived a very hard life for six years. Because he only ate hemp and wheat, the prince was emaciated and his limbs were weak.

Later, I realized that the truth cannot be obtained by working too hard, so I gave up the ascetic practice and accepted the milk elk offering from Sujata, the cowgirl, and my body was restored to health.

The five people in the entourage thought that the prince had given up on Dao Xin and would no longer follow and serve him for a long time.

6

Section 3 Enlightenment and Dharma to save sentient beings
Prince Shakyamuni crossed the Niren Chan River by himself and came to Bodh Gaya near Mount Gaya.

At that time, there was a boy who was mowing the grass, and he spread a seat with grass under a linden tree, and asked the prince to sit on it.

The prince made a strong vow: if he does not become enlightened, he will not take a seat.

Therefore, later in the Buddhist scriptures, this seat was called the Vajra seat.

On the evening of April 14th, the prince was disturbed by the devil in his meditation, but the prince was firm and unmoved, and subdued the devil with the power of great compassion.

After the demon was subdued, the prince continued to enter into meditation. In the early morning, Prince Shakyamuni relied on the vajra metaphor to remove the obstacles of affliction and knowledge, and on the fifteenth day of the fourth lunar month, he became a Buddha.

Therefore, the fifteenth day of the fourth lunar month is the day of Buddha Sakyamuni's enlightenment, the day when Buddha Sakyamuni passed away, and the day when Buddha was born. This day is the three auspicious days of Buddhism.

What is the truth that Buddha Shakyamuni realized? The most important thing is the emptiness of dependent origination. All things and all dharmas exist because of dependent origination, but they have no self-nature.

The universe and life exist from karma, and all dharmas are dependent on karma and harmony.

For example, our body is the result of the birth of our parents, the karma that we bring as the cause, and the result of our past ignorance and afflictions.

7

After a body with results is born, old age, sickness, and death cannot be avoided.

Therefore, to get rid of the pain of birth, old age, sickness and death, the only way to get rid of the afflictions caused by ignorance is to cultivate the Tao.

After Shakyamuni became a Buddha, he did not preach the scriptures for seventy-seven and forty-nine days.

The reason why the Buddha does not teach the Fa is that no one asks for the Fa, and there must be someone asking for the Fa.

Later, after the Great Brahma King and Emperor Shatian knew the reason why the Buddha did not teach the Dharma, they asked Buddha Shakyamuni for the Dharma on behalf of all living beings.

Buddha Shakyamuni agreed to preach the scriptures, and came to Varanas from Bodhgaya. On the fourth day of the sixth month, he first turned the Dharma Wheel of the Four Truths for five attendants who followed him. After these five people heard the Dharma, I shaved and went home that day.

At that time, besides these five monks, there were 80,000 sentient beings in the heavenly realm who listened to Buddha Shakyamuni turning the wheel of Dharma for the first time. After the teaching of the Dharma Wheel of the Four Noble Truths, the five monks and 80,000 celestial beings all attained Arahantship.

From the fourth day of the sixth month to the end of his death, Buddha Shakyamuni taught the Dharma Door of the Four Noble Truths countless times, saving countless sentient beings.

When Buddha Shakyamuni was 36 years old, on the fifteenth day of the third month of the lunar calendar, on Mount Vulture in India, Buddha Shakyamuni started to turn the Dharma Wheel without Phases twice.

The second turn of the Dharma Wheel includes "25,000 Verses of Prajna", "8,000 Verses of Prajna", "The Great Prajna Sutra", and the seventeen parts of Prajna mother and son.

8

From that day until he passed away, Buddha Shakyamuni taught the Dharma Wheel of No Form countless times, which caused countless sentient beings to develop Bodhicitta, enter the gate of the Mahayana, and ascend the position of Bodhisattva.

On the day that Buddha Shakyamuni turned the Dharma wheel for the second time, he incarnated into the Vajra Master again, and gave the Kalachakra empowerment to the Vajra disciples at Drepung Pagoda. Many Vajra disciples planted the seeds of becoming a Buddha.

After that, many Vajra disciples who became Buddhas gradually appeared.

There is a place in present-day Afghanistan, which belonged to ancient India at that time, and a king named Enzabudi invited Shakyamuni Buddha to lecture on scriptures.

When the Buddha went there, he asked King Enzhabodhi to become a monk, but he said he couldn't do it; he asked him to do asceticism, but he also said he couldn't do it; Buddha Shakyamuni taught him the method of blissful cultivation, and he gave King Enzhabodhi a lesson. And the princes and nobles poured the empowerment of dense vajra.

Later, King Enzabodhi cultivated very well, and became a Buddha. After becoming a Buddha, he gave all the people in Afghanistan many times of Dharma Dharma initiations. All those people at that time were accomplished, and some people took their bodies to rebirth. In the Pure Land, taking karma to be reborn in the Pure Land exists in the Pure Land, and bringing the body to the Pure Land is only available in Tantric Buddhism. For example, taking the body to the Pure Land of Dakinis.

At that time, all the people in Afghanistan were successful, so there were three empty cities.

Afghanistan was India's holy land at the time, and this was the beginning of esoteric practice.

9

Once, when Xia An lived for three months, Buddha Shakyamuni went there for thirty-three days, and taught the Tantric Dabai Umbrella Dharma, which was taught on the 33rd day.

Buddha Shakyamuni taught the esoteric dharma to save countless sentient beings, and many sentient beings rely on the splendor of esoteric law to become Buddhas. Why is it called sentient beings? Because the disciples of Buddha Shakyamuni are human beings, devas, Gandharvas, and all kinds of non-human beings, they are called sentient beings.

At the age of 47, Buddha Shakyamuni turned the wheel of Dharma three times and taught the Dharma of righteousness and injustice.

Buddha Shakyamuni preached the righteousness without righteousness, and he was in Shibajin and other places.

Buddha Shakyamuni turned the wheel of Dharma three times, and the content he taught included 84,000 Dharma doors.

Among these 84,000 kinds of dharmas, there are Hinayana, Mahayana Sutra, and Mahayana Tantra methods.

The followers of Shakyamuni Buddha, from kings, concubines, ministers to poor people, beggars, slaves, have everything in every class of society.

10

Section 4 Nirvana and the most complete truth
Buddha Shakyamuni taught scriptures for about 47 years, and his footprints are all over the banks of the Ganges.

At the age of 81, he traveled from the country of Makardha to Vaishali, and gave his teachings for the last time at the Bamboo Forest Temple. Then, he moved forward gradually, passing through every village, using the rest time to preach. In Popo Village, he accepted the teaching. The last offering of the blacksmith Chunda.

At that time, an outsider named Subhadra came to ask for advice, and Buddha Sakyamuni taught him again, and Subhadra became the last disciple of the Buddha.

Venerable Ananda asked the Buddha to live in the world three times, and Buddha Shakyamuni replied: All dharmas and myriad things will eventually perish. Everyone has life and must die. How can my body survive forever? This part of my life must be brought to annihilation in accordance with the natural law.

When Ananda, Anurud, and Rahula heard this, they could not help weeping.

Therefore, all the disciples asked Venerable Ananda to ask Buddha Shakyamuni four questions:

1. When the Buddha lived in the world, we depended on the Buddha as our teacher; after the Buddha’s Nirvana, who do we depend on as our teacher?

2. When the Buddha lives in the world, we live by the Buddha; after the Buddha Nirvana, how do we live?

3. When the Buddha lived in the world, the monks with evil deeds were subdued by the Buddha; after the Buddha's Nirvana, how did the monks in evil deeds subdue them?

4. When the Buddha lived in the world, the words and teachings of the Buddha were easy for everyone to believe and understand; after the Buddha's Nirvana, how can the scriptures inspire people to believe?

The Buddha answered these four questions and said: After I Nirvana, I should follow the precepts as a teacher; I should live in the place of four mindfulness; Bhikkhus with evil deeds should be silent; The first sentence of all the scriptures should be "As I hear it" as proof and faith.

Venerable Ananda and his disciples wept silently beside Shakyamuni Buddha, and the Buddha comforted them like a loving mother, saying: "You don't need to be sad. I have taught many teachings in my life. As long as you follow them and practice them, my Dharmakaya will last forever. stay in the world.

He also said: All sentient beings have Buddha-nature, and all can become Buddhas, and the Chanti castes who have permanently cut off their roots of goodness can also become Buddhas.

After speaking, Buddha Shakyamuni entered Nirvana quietly and calmly. This year, the Buddha was 81 years old.

The king of Kusinagar City and the four disciples of the Buddha held a grand dipping ceremony for Shakyamuni Buddha.

The Buddha's relics were invited by the eight kings of India to build pagodas to worship, one of which was near Lumbini.

150 years after the death of Buddha Shakyamuni, King Asoka took out all the relics from the seven towers except the tower near Lumbini and distributed them all over the world, so that people could build towers for worship.

This kind of stupa has remained in the world until now.

Buddha Shakyamuni spoke out the truth of his enlightenment, instructed us how to behave as human beings, and told people how to cultivate and become Buddhas by human beings. This is called the Buddhadharma.

12

These teachings taught by Shakyamuni were successively compiled and collected after his Nirvana, and were translated into various languages ​​and spread all over the world.

The Buddhist scriptures translated in China, which have been handed down to the present, are collectively known as the Tripitaka.

There are more than 40 copies of the Tripitaka from the South, more than 100 copies of the Han Dynasty, and more than 300 copies of the Tripitaka. The Tripitaka is an irreplaceable treasure in the history of world culture and is extremely valuable. 's literature.

13

Chapter 2 Collection of Buddhist Classics
Before Buddha Shakyamuni passed away, the 84,000 Dharma teachings he taught were not organized into words, because those disciples who had a personal relationship with Buddha Shakyamuni had great blessings, great wisdom, and strong vows.

Coupled with the blessing of Shakyamuni Buddha, no matter how many dharmas the Buddha taught, more than 90% of his disciples could memorize the Dharma word for word. The foundation of these disciples was so excellent. Therefore, the Buddha said at that time. The law does not need to be in writing.

After Buddha Shakyamuni passed away, people's blessings gradually became less and less, their wisdom became worse and worse, and their vows became weaker and weaker. Just by speaking, people cannot learn the Fa-rectification.

What does the classic collection mean? The Dharma spoken by arahants and bodhisattvas is compiled into text, which is called a collection of classics.

14

The first chapter of the first classic collection
Three months after Shakyamuni Buddha passed away, in Rajagaha, ancient India, five hundred Arahants gathered together for the first collection of scriptures.

They folded all the cassocks to make a throne. The first was the Venerable Ananda, who sat on the throne and dictated all the Suttas verbatim, and five hundred arahants sorted them out. into text.

Afterwards, the Venerable Upali (also translated as Wu Boli) took the seat and dictated Vinaya word for word, beginning with "As I hear it".

Five hundred arahants were listening to verify whether it was accurate, and finally they were compiled into text. This was the first collection of classics.

The second section of the second classic collection
110 years after Buddha Shakyamuni passed away, a monk named Vajjian appeared in India at that time. This monk always described the illegal as the law, and the violation of the precepts as conforming to the precepts. Impure behavior is said to be pure, and he thinks it will not break the precepts.

For this reason, seven hundred arahants headed by Venerable Yasa gathered in Vaishali, and again conducted a collection of scriptures, denied the fallacies of the Vaki monks, rearranged the scriptures, and saved the Buddhism.

It also organized some scriptures that were not included in the classics before into text. This is the second collection of classics.

The third section of the third classic collection
The third collection of classics was in Patiliputta, more than 200 years after the death of Buddha Shakyamuni.

At that time, there was a heresy called the Great God in India. In order to collect offerings, this outsider brought many disciples to join Buddhism.

After they joined Buddhism, they mixed Buddhism with cults. As a result, many people couldn't tell which is the righteous Fa, which is the cult or the wicked Fa.

For this reason, five hundred arahants, five hundred bodhisattvas, and 16,000 panditas headed by the Venerable Muggala (along with the Buddha's disciple Muggana) gathered in Huashe City for the collection of scriptures. , to distinguish between cults and Dharma, and at the same time organize into texts that have not been included in the classics before. This is the third classic collection.

The above three times are mainly classic collections of Theravada.

16

What is the classic collection of Mahayana? The scriptures of the Mahayana Sutra are the teachings of the eight bodhisattvas, mainly Manjushri and Maitreya, which are organized into text, and the Mahayana Prajna Sutra is organized into text by Venerable Ananda.

The Dharma Doors of Mahayana Tantra are organized into texts by warriors and brave mothers who are mainly Vajrapani Bodhisattva.

Many of the classic collections of Mahayana and Tantra are carried out on the Pure Land, some in the Tusita Maitreya Institute, some in the Thirty-Three Days, some in the Dragon Palace, and some in the Vulture Mountain.

In many different places, the Bodhisattvas have been organized into texts, which are the collection of Mahayana classics.

Southern Buddhism believes that there are six collections of scriptures: three in India, one in Sri Lanka, and two in Myanmar.

Tibetan Buddhism believes that the collection of Theravada classics is the three times in India.

When the scriptures were collected at that time, two languages ​​were used: Pali and Sanskrit.

More than 80% of the Hinayana methods are organized in Pali; the methods of Mahayana Sutra and Tantra are mainly organized in Sanskrit.

Buddhism at that time mainly used these two languages, so the collection of classics was also recorded in these two languages.

Chapter 3 The Four Sects of Buddhism
Section 1 Overview of the Four Sects of Buddhism
After the classics were collected, because the masters at that time had different understandings of the Buddhist scriptures, the meanings and principles were not exactly the same, and their understanding of the foundation, the Tao, and the fruit were also different. Therefore, Buddhism gradually formed four major schools, that is, there are ministries. , Jingbu School, Consciousness-Only School, and Madhyamika School.

Buddhism is further divided into Mahayana and Hinayana.

The Hinayana is divided into the Youbu School and the Jingbu School; the Mahayana School is divided into the Xianzong and the Tantric;

The foundation is the foundation of practice, including the permanent and impermanent Dharma, and everything in the universe is the foundation.

The four sects have different understandings on the existence or impermanence of the base, as well as the lack of self and the existence of self.

There are five ways: the way of supplying food, the way of adding practice, the way of seeing, the way of cultivation, and the way of non-cultivation.

18

The four schools also differ in their understanding of the five paths.

The fruit is the fruit of the three vehicles: the fruit of the sravaka, the fruit of the Arhat, and the fruit of the Mahayana Buddha.

The four factions also differ in their understanding of the three-way fruit status.

The second part of the ministry
The main basis of the Dharma of some sects is the "Great Vipassana" (Sanskrit: Abhidharma Mahāvibhāṣā Śāstra), which was assembled by Arahants.

There is a school that establishes right view, right mindfulness, foundation, path, and fruit with the "Great Vipassa Treatise".

Moreover, there are different interpretations of the "Great Vipassa Treatise" within some sects.

There used to be four great masters in a sect, and they were very famous four masters, namely: Shiyou, Fajiao, Juetian, and Jixian.

The interpretations of the "Great Vipassa Treatise" by the four major commentators are not the same. Due to the different understanding of the "Great Vipassa Treatise", some sects were gradually divided into eighteen divisions.

The formation of these eighteen divisions is due to different languages, places of residence, etc., but it is mainly due to the different understandings of the "Great Vipassana".

19

1. There is an understanding of the foundation
Basically, some schools believe that everything in the universe is impermanent, but it is not impermanent in an instant, but a continuous impermanence.

What is the impermanence of the moment? A normal person's finger can be divided into sixty-five moments. Some schools believe that everything in the universe changes, but it does not change in an instant. There is a process of birth, dwelling, and annihilation.

Other schools believe that even a moment is impermanent, and that everything in the universe changes every moment.

Quantum and molecules in all things change every moment, and the change in that moment has been proved by science.

But some schools believe that there is no momentary change, only continuous change, which is a difference.

In addition, on the basis of the foundation, the understanding of the pudgala (Sanskrit pudgala) is different. Some sects think that the pudgala has no self, which refers to the kind of self that the heretics think does not exist, "I" It exists. I rest on the five aggregates. Sometimes I think that all the five aggregates are me, and sometimes I think that the five aggregates are me. The eighteen parts are different.

Basically, other schools believe that there are two truths: mundane truth and ultimate truth.

20

But there are sects that deny the Two Truths.

2. There is an understanding of the ministry of Taoism
The Tao is the five Taos, and within the five Taos there are the five Taos of Shravaka and the five Taos of karmic perception.

On the basis of renunciation, the pursuit of Arahantship of Shravaka is the path of shravakaya; on the basis of renunciation, the pursuit of Arahantship of predestined enlightenment is the path of predestination.

A hundred kalpas of blessings have been accumulated in the path of predestined enlightenment, so when he becomes an Arhat fruit of predestined enlightenment, he has a majestic appearance similar to that of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas.

1. Some sects believe that the afflictions can be cut off only by the absence of the self, but at the same time they deny the hindrance of knowledge, and believe that only the hindrance of affliction is not the hindrance of knowledge.
Also, the five Mahayana paths are not recognized.

2. When Sakyamuni became a Buddha, he went through the path of accumulation, the path of practice, the path of seeing, the path of cultivation, and the path of becoming a Buddha without cultivating the path.
Some sects believe that when Buddha Shakyamuni accumulated the blessings of the three major kalpas of Asamji, the last four realms were enlightened in one day and one night. This is very different from what other sects say. difference.

This is a different view on the "Tao".

twenty one

3. Have some understanding of the fruit
1. On the fruit, some schools have different views from other schools, especially nirvana. Some schools agree with residual nirvana and non-residual nirvana, but deny non-resistance nirvana.
2. Among the Buddha's four bodies, there are sects that deny the existence of Sambhogakaya and Self-nature.
3. Among the 84,000 dharmas, some schools only recognize 80,000 dharmas and do not recognize 4,000 dharmas;
Some sects are divided into early, middle and late stages, and they are different in understanding.

The sects before Nagarjuna belonged to the early and middle stages, the sects in the middle did not recognize Mahayana Buddhism, the sects after Nagarjuna belonged to the later sects, and the sects in the early and late stages both recognized Mahayana Buddhism. But if you don't practice Mahayana, this is the main situation of Buddhism.

The third chapter

The second of the four major sects of Buddhism is the Sutra sect.

There are two schools of scriptures: Suijiao Xing School and Sui Zhengli School.

The Suijiao Xingpai established the foundation, the Tao, and the fruit with the "Ahan Sutra".

The Suizheng School establishes the foundation, the Tao, and the fruit with seven quantitative theories.

1. The Ministry of Economics' understanding of the foundation
The foundation of the sect of scriptures: the law of impermanence is the impermanence of a moment,

Denying the continual impermanence.

Some schools believe that the universe is a continuous impermanence, a process of birth, abiding, and cessation, rather than a momentary impermanence.

2. The understanding of Taoism by the sutras
Dao: There are five paths—the path of accumulation, the path of addition, the path of seeing, the path of cultivation, and the path of non-cultivation.

The path of resources is the first step in entering the path of accumulating blessings.

Jiaxing Dao is the preparatory stage before entering the Dao.

Seeing the Way is the real realization that people have no self.

To cultivate the Dao is to cut off afflictions and continue to cultivate people without self.

Without cultivation, the troubles have been completely cut off, and there is no need to cut them off

If you are troubled to practice and study, then it is called non-cultivation or non-learning.

This is the five.

The difference between actual realization and realization is roughly as follows: If someone who has never been to Lhasa, listens to others about Lhasa, and thinks of Lhasa in his mind, it is a kind of comparison and understanding.

If you don’t understand emptiness, you will understand emptiness in your heart by listening to others talk about emptiness, which is called understanding by quantity; if you see Lhasa in person, you will understand by quantity.

3. The understanding of the fruit of the Ministry of Economics
Fruit: There are three kinds of fruit, including the fruit of the sravaka, the fruit of the arahant of the predestined enlightenment, and the fruit of the Mahayana Buddha.

The Shravaka Arahants and the Fated Arahants are both the Arahants of Theravada.

Shravaka Arhats only hear the Mahayana Dharma and pass it on to others. They do not practice it themselves, but only the Hinayana Dharma.

After such practitioners have attained Arahantship, they are called Shravaka Arahants.

An arahant of predestined enlightenment is someone who cultivates the twelve dependent origins and realizes the fruit of Arhat.

Because of his own vows, he will only appear when the Dharma is extinguished or dark calamities, and the vows will prompt him to cultivate the twelve Dependent Origination, and finally realize the fruit of Arahantship.

When the dharma was destroyed or the dark tribulation, there were no cultivators, only one or two, and not many senior brothers, so it was also called Dujue.

twenty four

The sects of scriptures believe that the fruit status of the Buddha is the incarnation and the body of the law, denying the existence of the body of retribution and self-nature.

The era without Dharma is very long.

In Buddhism, kalpas are often used as time units. According to the Mahayana saying, a great kalpa exceeds 12.9 billion years. Kalpas are divided into two types: bright kalpas and dark kalpas. Bright kalpas refer to the time when a Buddha is born and has the light of the Buddha's teaching. robbery.

A dark kalpa is a kalpa in which no Buddha is born, and the kalpa in which Buddha Shakyamuni comes is a bright kalpa, and a thousand Buddhas will appear in this kalpa, so it is called a sage kalpa, which means that many sages will appear.

The birth of a Buddha is very rare, and only one bright kalpa appears in countless dark kalpas.

It is said in the Kusa Lun that in the past there were five bright kalpas, but there were fourteen hundred dark kalpas.

Moreover, although there are many Buddhas born during the bright kalpas, in so many dark kalpas, there is not even a single Buddha.

Not only that, even in bright kalpas, it is not always possible to encounter the Dharma.

4. The Three Treasures in Theravada
There are some schools and schools of classics who practice the small method.

There is a big difference between the Three Treasures considered by Theravada and the Three Treasures considered by Mahayana and Tantric.

25

1. The Buddha's Treasure in Theravada
The Buddha in Theravada believes that there are only three Buddhas: the Burning Lamp Buddha in the past, the Sakyamuni Buddha in the present, and the Maitreya Buddha in the future.

The Dharma of Mahayana Xianzong records many Buddhas such as the Buddhas of the Three Worlds, and the Dharma of Mahayana Tantra records even more. There are four deities and many other Buddhas.

When Buddha Shakyamuni taught Theravada, he did not mention Buddhas such as Amitabha, Fudo Tathagata, etc. These Buddhas were not recorded in the Buddhist scriptures of Theravada, so many schools of Theravada did not recognize them.

2. The magic weapon believed by Theravada
The magic weapon that Theravada believes is only the classics of Theravada.

The Hinayana can be divided into three periods, the early, middle, and late periods, and the understanding of magic weapons in different periods is also different.

The early Theravada was more than 200 years after the death of Buddha Shakyamuni, and the Arhats organized and wrote the Great Vipassa Treatise. The Theravada Dharma in this period is called the early Dharma.

The early Theravada recognized Mahayana Buddhism, because although the early Arahants did not practice Mahayana themselves, they often passed on the Prajna Sutra and other Mahayana disciplines to many Mahayana disciples.

26

The middle stage of Theravada is from the "Great Vipassa Treatise" to the final disciple of Nagarjuna Bodhisattva in his later years.

The mid-term Theravada denied the Mahayana Dharma. It used eighteen reasons to say that the Mahayana Dharma was not the will of the Buddha, but was taught by demons.

In the later Theravada, it was after the Discriminatory Master, who refuted all these eighteen reasons. After the refutation, the Later Theravada also agreed with many Mahayana Buddhist teachings, such as "Psalm Xian Xingyanpin" and so on.

3. The Sangha considered by Theravada
The Sangha of Theravada only recognizes Arahants, and does not recognize all the Bodhisattvas such as Guanyin, Manjusri, Vajra Hand, etc. Because these Bodhisattvas are not recorded in the Theravada teachings, these Bodhisattvas are only found in the Mahayana teachings, and there are many records in the teachings of the Mahayana Buddhism. The Bodhisattva, more recorded in the esoteric method.

To sum up, the Hinayana and the Mahayana have different understandings of the Three Jewels.

The Buddha Treasures are only recorded in the Dharma door of Theravada, and only the three Buddhas are recorded, which is different from the Mahayana's understanding of the Dharma and the Sangha Treasures.

27

Section 4 Consciousness Only
The founder of the Consciousness-Only School was Wusang Bodhisattva. Wusang Bodhisattva practiced in seclusion in a cave for 12 years. He saw Maitreya Bodhisattva with his own eyes, and was taken by Maitreya Bodhisattva to Tusatian Maitreya Temple for an hour, which is equivalent to 50 years in the world. He returned to the world and passed on the Maitreya Five Classics.

Because there are so many people in the human world who have the foundation of consciousness-only, Wusang Bodhisattva created the consciousness-only school.

1. The general concept of Consciousness Only
The general concept of the Consciousness-Only School is: the foundation is based on others, the realization is realized, and the whole is calculated.

According to him: Everything depends on him, because everything depends on karma.

Chengshi: Chengshi means that people have no ego and law has no ego.

All-round calculation: Except for the above two, the others are all-round calculations, such as the sky.

According to him and Chengshi, it is considered to be real, and it is considered that it is not real.

Consciousness only believes that the external environment does not exist, it is only a change in the heart.

That is to say:

28

If one wants to know that all Buddhas in the three worlds should observe the nature of the Dharma realm, everything is created only by the mind

2. Consciousness-only understanding of Tao
The Consciousness-Only School believes that the Tao is divided into the five Taos of Shravaka, the five Taos of karmic perception, and the five Taos of Mahayana.

3. Consciousness-only understanding of fruit
For the understanding of the fruit, the Consciousness-Only School believes that there is the fruit of the sravaka, the fruit of the karma, and the fruit of the Buddha.

Acknowledging that there is residual nirvana, no residual nirvana, and no abiding nirvana.

The only place where a bodhisattva attains Buddhahood is in the realm of desire, and does not recognize the pure realm of pure form in the realm of form.

It is believed that the Mahayana way can remove the two obstacles, and turning the wheel of law three times is the ultimate method.

4. Classification of Consciousness-Only Schools
Consciousness-only is divided into two schools: reality-only consciousness and false appearance-only consciousness.

Reality Consciousnessists believe that what the eyes see is what actually exists.

29

Consciousness-only school of false appearance believes that the external environment seen by the eyes is false appearance, that is, the existence of thought, not the actual existence.

Section 5 Madhyamika
The founder of Madhyamika is Nagarjuna Bodhisattva.

The general concept of Madhyamika is to cut off the edge and cut off the edge, and realize the right view of the Madhyamika.

The Madhyamika school denies the concept of right view of the first three schools, and believes that all dharmas are inherently empty, and according to the right view of the Madhyamika school, self-enforcement and law-enforcement can be eliminated.

Once the two obstacles are broken, one will realize the great Bodhi.

The Madhyamika school believes that Buddha Shakyamuni became a Buddha countless kalpas ago, and that the place where he attained Buddhahood was the pure and dense realm of form.

Siddhartha is the incarnation of Sakyamuni Buddha's Sambhogakaya, who manifests in the human world to become a Buddha, turn the wheel of Dharma, and nirvana.

The second turning of the Dharma Wheel is the most ultimate Dharma door, because most of the disciples of the second turning Dharma Wheel are Arhats and Bodhisattvas. Facing these saints, the Buddha wants to teach the ultimate Dharma door.

When the Buddha first turned the Dharma Wheel of the Four Noble Truths, the thirty-seven dharmas and other dharmas he talked about were all real.

When turning the Formless Dharma Wheel for the second time, everything from form to knowing everything is non-existent.

Some people think that there is a contradiction between the teachings of the first turning of the Dharma wheel and the second turning of the Dharma. Therefore, Buddha Shakyamuni taught the third turning of the Dharma wheel.

The disciples who turn the Falun for the first time are those with dull roots, and the disciples who turn the Falun for the second time are those with sharp roots.

Therefore, those with dull roots have no doubts about the Dharma taught by the Buddha; those with sharp roots understand the truth of emptiness as soon as they hear it, and have no doubts about the Dharma.

The disciples who turn the Falun three times are middle-level people, so they have doubts.

The Dharma taught by the Buddha to the middle-minded people is not the most ultimate Dharma, but the Consciousness-Only School believes that it is the most ultimate, and the Madhyamika school denies this statement.

Section 6 Tantra
Buddha Shakyamuni taught many esoteric methods, such as Kalachakra and Dhysikava, in the human world.

Esoteric Dharma is about the method of becoming a Buddha in one's body, such as the bright point of the Qi channel and the kundalini fire.

Tantra is divided into four parts: the department of affairs, the department of practice, the department of yoga, and the department of supreme yoga.

The affairs department talks about the practice of the rebirth deity and the self-born deity through the yoga of the six gods; the practice department talks about: the method of paying equal attention to both internal and external yoga; the yoga part is about: the method of realizing the wisdom of light through the inner yoga; the supreme yoga part It is talking about the second stage, that is, the Dharma door of the generation stage and the completion stage.

31

When practising the first three sects, one can become a Buddha instantly by cultivating the method of longevity; cultivating the supreme yoga, one can become a buddha within a short life span.

The difference between tantra and sutra is: tantra has many convenient methods, and you can become a Buddha through music cultivation.

Xianzong must accumulate the three great asamkhya kalpas through asceticism to become a Buddha.

32

Chapter 4 Tibetan Buddhism
With the passage of time, Buddhism has gradually developed into many sects, and these sects have been divided into three branches of Buddhism, which are divided into three major sects: Southern Buddhism, Chinese Buddhism, and Tibetan Buddhism.

Southern Buddhism is now the Buddhism of Southeast Asian countries, mainly Myanmar, Sri Lanka, and Thailand.

Southern Buddhism mainly talks about the method of Theravada, the Five Paths and the Thirty-seven Paths of Theravada, and these are its main contents.

Chinese Buddhism is dominated by countries such as China, Japan and South Korea.

Belongs to the Dharma.

Xianzong is the method of Mahayana, and Mahayana also has the method of Tantra.

The main contents of the sutra Dharma of Chinese Buddhism are: compassion, bodhicitta, six paramitas and so on.

Tibetan Buddhism is a combination of Buddhism and esoteric Buddhism. It combines the dharma of esoteric Buddhism with that of esoteric Buddhism.

Tibetan Buddhism is mainly based in Tibetan areas, Inner Mongolia, and Outer Mongolia. Now, there are more and more Tibetan Buddhism in Europe and Han.

Section 1 Overview of Tibetan Buddhism 1. Princess Wencheng entered Tibet Tibetan Buddhism has a history of more than 1,300 years.

In 642 AD, during the reign of the Tibetan king Songtsen Gampo, Buddhism entered the Tibetan area.

In the past, people in Tibetan areas were very savage and often fought wars. They fought in places like India, Nepal, and China, and they fought every year with every neighboring country, and wars broke out.

If you fight outside, fight inside yourself.

Songtsen Gampo thought: It seems that we Tibetans need a culture and belief to control people's hearts.

In the world at that time, in addition to Buddhism, there were forty or fifty different sects. Songtsen Gampo basically studied all these sects, and also studied the Taoist culture of the Han region, and finally chose Buddhism as the belief of the Tibetan people.

34

Then, King Songtsen Gampo sent many capable young people from Tibet to India to study Buddhism.

Among these people, some died on the way, some died of heatstroke after arriving in India, and only some returned after learning.

Among those who came back, there was a man named Sambuza, who studied Buddhism in India. He learned very well and was very knowledgeable. When he returned to the Tibetan area, he began to teach the Dharma.

At that time, there was no written language in Tibetan areas, so the Dharma could not be passed on, nor could it be spread by word of mouth. Sambuza created the Tibetan script in order to spread the Buddhadharma.

He directly took twenty-four letters from the thirty-four letters of Sanskrit and used them as Tibetan letters. On this basis, he created six more letters by himself, adding them into the thirty letters of Tibetan. , and thus created the Tibetan language.

Tibetans learn Sanskrit very quickly, because most Tibetan characters were originally translated from Sanskrit.

After the creation of the Tibetan script, the translation of scriptures began. Therefore, from Songtsen Gampo, the spread of Buddhism in Tibet began.

At the same time, Princess Wencheng of the Han Dynasty went to Tibet to have a kiss, and brought a 12-year-old statue of Sakyamuni Buddha, which is still enshrined in the Jokhang Temple in Lhasa.

In addition, it also brought a lot of works of great masters from the Chinese region. In Tibetan areas, the most famous is the works of Master Yuanshi, and there are 21 Chinese translations.

The Tibetan Tripitaka is divided into Tengyur and Ganyur.

There are more than 100 copies of "Kangyur" and more than 200 copies of "Tangyur".

Twenty-one of them were translated from Chinese to Tibetan, and the others were translated from Sanskrit to Tibetan.

2. Guru Padmasambhava entered Tibet to teach the Dharma
About a hundred years after Songtsen Gampo, the Tibetans produced a Tibetan king named Chisong Detsen.

Trisong Detsen invited Padmasambhava and static life masters from India to the Tibetan area.

After Guru Rinpoche arrived in the Tibetan area, he passed on the esoteric method. In the time of Songtsen Gampo, there were some esoteric methods in the Tibetan area, but only the esoteric method of Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva. There were very few other esoteric methods. The Dharma door is the main.

Guru Padmasambhava brought the esoteric method to the Tibetan area and passed on the esoteric method. There are twenty-five disciples who have cultivated the secret method in their lifetime. These twenty-five are the twenty-five disciples of Guru Rinpoche.

Beginning with Guru Rinpoche, more and more masters have come to Tibet to teach Tantra. There are more than 5,000 great siddhas and masters from India who have been to Tibet, a lot.

36

Because India is very close to the Tibetan area, even in 1193, when India destroyed the Dharma, the Nalanda Temple was burnt down. The great Panditas, the great siddhas, and the masters all fled to the Tibetan area to take refuge with their scriptures on their backs. More than 5,000 eminent monks followed.

The succession of the Dharma lineage of Tibetan Buddhism is so complete because many great siddhis have come from India.

In addition, when Tibetan Buddhism translated scriptures, there were more than 700 translators before and after. From the history of various sects, no one has ever sent so many scripture translators. This is also the success of Tibetan Buddhism. another reason.

3. Masters of static life theory enter Tibet to teach precepts
Before Guru Rinpoche entered the Tibetan area, the life-time master came to the Tibetan area and was the first master to come to the Tibetan area to teach the precepts.

After the master of static life theory entered Tibet, the king of Tibet said: We Tibetans should also become ordained and receive the precepts of not being liberated.

The master of life-skills said: Whether Tibetans can become a monk or not, they must first try.

So, I first selected seven people to become monks, and after they became monks, I saw if they could stand it for three years.

Three years later, the vitalist found that the precepts of these monks were very quiet, they kept the precepts with ease, and they achieved some achievements in three years.

37

The master of still life said: Tibetans can be ordained.

Since then, the precept of not liberation has been passed down, and many Tibetans have been ordained to become monks.

There are more and more Tibetan monks, and the life-changing master said: I want to build a monastery.

The first monastery in Tibet, the Samye Monastery in Lhasa, was built in this way.

When the Samye Monastery was built, a lot of people came. The monks and the lay people carried a lot of materials such as earth and stones. During the day, they carried them to the foundation. At night, some ghosts and gods all moved back to their original positions, and they moved back and forth like this. .

Later, Master Padmasambhava went to the Tibetan area and subdued the demon king in the Lianshi Cave in what is now the Nyingchi area.

After conquering the Demon King, Samye Monastery was built.

You should have heard of the place in Nyingchi, where there is a snow-capped mountain called Nanga Bawa, and there is a lotus cave nearby, where Guru Padmasambhava conquered the devil.

Samye Monastery is the first monastery in the Tibetan area and the first monastery of Tibetan Buddhism, which also marks the official establishment of Tibetan Buddhism.

4. The method of extinction of Langdama
Almost 70 years after the completion of Samye Monastery, a Tibetan king named Langdama appeared in the Tibetan area. He and his courtiers respected the Bon religion, and later began to destroy the Buddha and the Dharma.

38

Rangdama's extinction method is roughly like this: Only lay people are allowed to recite sutras, and all monks must return to the secular world.

Therefore, there were no monks in Tibetan areas during that period, and it was not until many years later that there were monks.

When Langdama destroyed the Dharma, there were three eminent monks in the Tibetan area who fled from Lhasa to the Amdo area. After more than 30 years of practice in Amdo, a man named Lagan Gongba Resai wanted to become a monk and asked these three masters to become a monk preach to him.

However, it takes five monks to pass the ordination precepts. At that time, there were only three monks. What should we do? Later, two monks from the Han region were invited, and five Tibetan and Han monks passed on the monk precepts to Lagan Gongba Resai together.

Therefore, the inheritance of precepts in Tibetan Buddhism is a combination of Tibetan and Chinese. Everyone must know this.

In this way, Tibetan Buddhism once again has monks, and when there are monks, it means that the Buddha's Dharma has been passed down.

Since then, twelve more children have become monks in Tibetan areas, and gradually, more and more monks have become monks in Tibetan areas.

5. Nyingma School
The Nyingma School was formed almost in the eighth century AD and is the earliest sect of Tibetan Buddhism.

39

After there were monks in Tibet, these monks first practiced the methods of the Nyingma sect, that is, the methods of the Nyingma sect before Langdama destroyed the dharma.

In the process of cultivating, I found some problems: when King Langdama destroyed the Dharma, all the Dharma books were burnt, some lay people wrote down all that they could recite before, some places were forgotten, and there were some loopholes.

When some family members were writing, they added some content they thought they had forgotten.

At that time, Buddhist disciples in Tibetan areas all discovered this problem, and everyone felt that they must go to India again to ask for the Fa.

Therefore, many Buddhist disciples went to India in batches.

What Dharma door do you ask? I continued to search for the original Dzogchen method of the Nyingma School, but after searching all over India, I couldn't find this method. At this time, many people had doubts in their hearts, whether there was any Dzogchen method, everyone stopped searching, only Whatever kind of great siddhis you can meet, study the Fa with that great siddhis.

Later, after these Buddhist disciples returned from their studies in India, the teachings were different for each of them, especially the esoteric teachings of the Supreme Yoga Department, which were very different.

At that time, many people began to have doubts: Will there be fake Dharma in our Tibetan area? How to do it? Everyone discussed that they should invite one of India's top Mahasiddhas to save Tibetan Buddhism.

At that time, the top Mahasiddha in India was Venerable Atisha.

40

Venerable Atisha has several characteristics: First, the inheritance is the most complete.

Venerable Atisha has the inheritance of Nagarjuna Bodhisattva, Wusang Bodhisattva, Shiqin Bodhisattva and other major Bodhisattvas. The inheritance of the sutras is complete, and even the inheritance of Theravada is also very complete.

For people in Tibetan areas, the first thing they see is his heritage.

Second, his listening, thinking, and cultivation are very complete.

Third, his achievements are high.

Therefore, the Tibetans at that time, the Master, and King Ali from the Tibetan area discussed together: We should invite the Venerable Atisha to come to the Tibetan area to teach the Fa.

In order to invite the Venerable Atisha, the Tibetan area sent many people, one after another, to India, and finally the Venerable Atisha was invited.

After arriving in the Tibetan area, Venerable Atisha began to rectify Tibetan Buddhism, and cleaned up those that were really not in accordance with the law at that time, such as some from the upper body of the emperor, and some false teachings.

His Holiness also sorted out the outlines of the entire 84,000 Dharma-doors and wrote the famous "Bodhi Path and Torch", which has benefited countless people in future generations.

6. Kadampa
Venerable Atisha came to the Tibetan area to spread the Dharma later, and he assisted the eldest disciple Chung Dunpa to establish the Kadam School.

The main practice of Kadampa is the Three Ways:

The lower, the middle, and the upper.

The Three Ways taught by Venerable Atisha mainly focus on three aspects: renunciation, bodhicitta, and the concept of impermanence in life.

In terms of esoteric methods, the most famous Kadampa schools are Sakyamuni Buddha, Avalokitesvara with eleven faces, one thousand hands and one thousand eyes, King Fudoming, the four deities of the twenty-one mother, and the sixteen bright points of Kadam. .

There are twelve auspicious heavenly mothers, mother-in-law Vajra protectors and so on.

Venerable Atisha passed on the Three Ways to Thongtunpa. In addition, Thongtunpa also has a lot of esoteric traditions.

The disciples of Venerable Atisha have accomplished a lot.

At that time, there were 600,000 monks in the Kadam sect in Tibet, and there were 170,000 people in one monastery.

After the establishment of the Kadam School, the Dharma-rectification flourished, and all the things that were not in the way of the Dharma disappeared naturally.

After the Nyingma Sect, the Kadam Sect was established, followed by the Kagyu Sect and the Sakya Sect. These two sects were established at about the same time.

7. Kagyu School
The Kagyu sect is divided into Shangpa Kagyu and Dabo Kagyu. The patriarch of Shangpa Kagyu is Kezhiqiongwu. He went to India three times and worshipped 150 great siddhis as teachers, and obtained many methods. He founded the Shangpa Kagyu Sect in Tibetan areas, lived one hundred and fifty years old, and saved countless sentient beings.

Guru Marpa, Venerable Milarepa, and Gampopa are the founders of the Dapo Kagyu School.

Master Marpa went to India three times, met many teachers such as Naropa and Mizhiba, and learned a lot of Dharma.

When Master Marpa first started teaching the Dharma in Tibetan areas, he was not very well-known. He taught the Dharma in a small place called Gongtang at that time.

At that time, Venerable Milarepa went to Master Marpa to ask for the Dharma. At that time, Milarepa had a lot of karma, so Master Marpa asked him to eliminate the karma through hard work.

Milarepa wanted to seek the method of becoming a Buddha in one lifetime, and said to Master Marpa: Master, you teach me the method of becoming a Buddha in one lifetime. to you.

Marpa said: Did you really make offerings? He said: "It's really supportive.

Master Marpa said: Well, from today onwards, your body, speech, and mind are mine. Whatever I tell you to do, you should do it. From tomorrow, help me build a palace.

When Milarepa built the palace halfway, Master Marpa saw it, and found a reason to let him demolish it all. After demolishing it, let Milareba rebuild it. many times.

All Milarepa's karma was eliminated through ascetic practice, and after that, he taught the Dharma, including the Dharma of Dhyana, the Six Dharma of Naruo, and the Dharma of Victory Vajra.

Then, Venerable Milareba began to retreat and practice, and he became a Buddha in his lifetime.

Venerable Milarepa had two great disciples: Gampopa and Jajumpa.

Gampopa is a monk and a great achiever with the most disciples. He has all the inheritance of Venerable Milarepa.

The era of Master Gampopa's teaching was also the most prosperous period of the Kagyu sect. Master Gampopa's teaching was to ask everyone not to pursue material life, but to practice with one heart.

There are many siddhas of the Kagyu sect. At that time, half of the Tibetan practitioners were Kagyu sects, half of the Kagyu sects were beggars, and half of the beggars were Mahasiddhas.

The disciples of Master Gampopa founded the four major sects of Dapo Kagyu: Karma Kagyu, Padrup Kagyu, Caipa Kagyu, and Barong Kagyu.

Later, Dapo Kagyu gradually divided into eight sub-sects.

The main method of the Kagyu school in the right view is Mahamudra, and the main deities are the Vajrayana, the Hevajra, and the Victory Vajra.

8. Sakya
The Patriarchs of the Sakya Sect are the Five Sakya Patriarchs.

The first patriarch was Kunga Nyingpo, the second patriarch was Sonam Zimo, the third patriarch was Drapa Gyaltsen, the fourth patriarch was Gongga Gyaltsen, and the fifth patriarch was Sakya Phaspa.

The Five Sakya Patriarchs have handed down many excellent methods, and the most special method is called Daoguo, which is the most excellent in the Sakya sect.

In the past, the Sakya and Kagyu sects still practiced the five great treatises and the thirteen golden methods.

When the Sakya sect spread to the Yuan Dynasty, the two patriarchs, Gongga Gyaltsen and Sakya Phasepa, became the national teachers of the Yuan Dynasty emperor Kublai Khan. Since then, Tibetan Buddhism has spread to the Han region. historically recorded.

Nine, the sect
The main patriarchs of the Juenang sect were Yumo Mijue Dorje and later Tuppo Xirao Gyaltsen. They also handed down a lot of dharmas, the most important dharma being his Kongjian.

Now the Kalachakra taught in various monasteries is mainly the inheritance of the Joonang School.

In addition, the inheritance of Jue Nang sect empowerment is very rich.

10. Dividend
The founder of the Xijie School was Padangpa, who mainly practiced the body method.

45

After Patriarch Bodhidharma passed away after showing false appearances in Han, his real body went to the Tibetan area, that is, Padangpa.

Xijie Pai is divided into matrilineal and paternal lineage. The matrilineal line was passed down from Padangpa to Maji Lazhun, and the paternal line was passed down to Chitso Jepa.

Eleven, Gelugpa
I talked about the Nyingma School, Kadam School, Kagyu School, Sakya School, Juenang School, and Sijie School. Everyone has some concepts about the various schools of Tibetan Buddhism. The last school of Tibetan Buddhism formed, It's the Gruists.

The patriarch and founder of Gelugpa is Master Tsongkhapa, who has sixteen unparalleled merits.

The first merit is that the transformation world is unparalleled.

why do you say so? Because Master Tsongkhapa is the incarnation of all Buddhas and Tathagatas, the true incarnation of Manjushri, and also the incarnation of Avalokitesvara and Vajra-hand Bodhisattva. This is the incarnation of Master Tsongkhapa.

The second is that birth is unparalleled.

As soon as Master Tsongkhapa was born, when cutting the umbilical cord, a drop of blood fell on the ground, and a Bodhi tree grew out of this place.

There is no such auspicious sign of a bodhi tree at birth, except for Shakyamuni Buddha and Master Tsongkhapa.

46

The third is the incomparable prophecy.

There are many Bodhisattvas and Mahasiddhas who have been prophesied by Buddha Shakyamuni, but the prophecies of Master Tsongkhapa are different.

The Prophecy of Manjusri Roots:

In this world, I Nirvana, the earth becomes empty, and you appear in a different form, doing what all Buddhas do.

At that time, in the snow-capped mountains, there was joyful Lan Ruo.

This is what Shakyamuni Buddha told Manjushri:

After my Nirvana, when this world becomes empty, you will appear in the form of an ordinary person, and you will perform the deeds of the Buddhas.

At that time, in the snow-capped mountains, you built the Huanxi Temple.

Huanxi Monastery was the later Ganden Monastery.

Buddha Shakyamuni once foretold that Master Tsongkhapa performed the actions of all the Buddhas. There are twelve kinds of actions of the Buddhas and Tathagatas. The most special one is lecturing the scriptures.

Master Tsongkhapa is unparalleled in listening, thinking, practicing, speaking, debating, and writing.

Therefore, the Tsongkhapa prayer reads:

no predestined sadness

Unsullied Wisdom King's Subtle Sound

The Secret Lord of the Devil's Army

Snowland Zhiyan Tsongkhapa

Prayer before Lobsang Zahua

The Fifth Dalai Lama explained the phrase "Tsongkhapa in the snowy land": All the great siddhis in the Tibetan area add up to Master Tsongkhapa, and one by one, no one is as good as Tsongkhapa.

For example, some masters are as high as Tsongkhapa in achievement, but not as good as Tsongkhapa in their aspirations and actions; some masters are not as good as Tsongkhapa in hearing and thinking.

For example, Venerable Milarepa, his achievements are not inferior to that of Master Tsongkhapa, but he is not as good as Master Tsongkhapa in lecturing, and not as good as Master Tsongkhapa in terms of inheritance, because Master Tsongkhapa has the inheritance of all major sects. Venerable Milarepa has only the Kagyu lineage.

Master Tsongkhapa was from Qinghai. After arriving in Tibet, he worshipped great siddhis of various schools as teachers. His teachers included Nyingma, Kadam, Kagyu, Sakya, and Jonang schools. , there are all sects, so the inheritance of his Dharma is very complete.

Master Tsongkhapa worshipped more than 40 teachers, all of whom were the top great siddhis of each school at that time. Therefore, Master Tsongkhapa received teachers from Nyingma, Kadam, Kagyu, Sakya, and Kyonang schools. inherited.

Then, Master Tsongkhapa merged the most quiet and complete methods of each school and founded the Gelug School, also known as the Yellow Sect.

Gelugpa's Matou Mingwang, Puba Vajra, and Shanjian Dharma Protector are the inheritance of Nyingma Patriarch Guru Rinpoche; Densely Vajra, Naruo Six Dharma, and Mahamudra are the inheritance of Kagyu Pai; Sanshidao, Guanyin Bodhisattva empowerment, etc. The inheritance of Kadampa; Victory Vajra, Thirteen Golden Dharmas, etc. are the inheritance of Sakya; Kalachakra and more than 300 Sui Xu initiations are the inheritance of Juenang; Therefore, the Gelug School is a great fusion of the methods and traditions of the major sects.

Everyone should know: Master Tsongkhapa has sixteen incomparable qualities, and the last one is the incomparable creation of a sect.

why do you say so? Before Master Tsongkhapa founded the Gelug Sect, there were many sects in Tibetan areas, large and small, including four major sects and more than ten minor sects.

After Master Tsongkhapa established the Gelug Sect, there has never been any other sect.

why is that? Because of the great integration of Buddhist traditions and dharma schools, there is no more splendid dharma than this sect.

After Guru Rinpoche established the Nyingma Sect, Venerable Atisha also established the Kadam Sect, because the Nyingma Sect did not have the very special Sanshidao, Avalokitesvara, Sixteen Bright Points, etc., so he established it alone. this pie.

After the Kadam School, the Kagyu School appeared, because Venerable Atisha did not have some of the Kagyu practices such as Mahamudra, but Master Marpa had these practices. In this way, large and small schools continued to appear.

49

After the establishment of the Gelug faction, no other faction has appeared. Everyone should know this.

At that time, Emperor Yongle of the Ming Dynasty invited Master Tsongkhapa three times. Later, Master Tsongkhapa sent his attendant, Master Shakyamuni, to represent him in Han to teach the Dharma.

After arriving in Nanjing, the capital at that time, Master Shakyamuni saved Emperor Yongle's mother and gave Emperor Yongle the empowerment of great mighty virtue.

When the master went to Nanjing, he was accompanied by more than 300 monks. Emperor Yongle conferred nine of them as great masters and eighteen as masters.

However, the ministers did not know what to call these gurus. After seeing these gurus, they were called lamas.

Since then, Tibetan monks have become lamas in the Han region, and lama means guru. This is a very good origin for Tibetan Buddhism, and it shows that Tibetan masters can be teachers of Han people.

Since then, some places in China have called Tibetan Buddhism Lamaism.

In April 1415, the Yongle Emperor ordered Master Shakya Yeshi to be "Miaojue Yuantonghuici Pu Yingfu State's Great Teacher Empowering Hongshan Xitian Buddha Son Great State Master" and gave him a seal.

After Emperor Yongle died, Emperor Xuande respected the master more than Emperor Yongle and let him live in Xifayuan Temple.

In 1433, Master Shakyamuni was entrusted with the title of "Myriad Elements, Miaoming, Zhenru, and Pure Prajna, Hongzhao, Puying Fuguo, and the Great Kindness of Dharma King Xitian Zhengjue Ru from the Great Yuantong Buddha", referred to as Dharma King of Great Compassion. The Tibetan name is synonymous with Xianqin Qujie.

It was also from that time that the emperors of the Ming Dynasty would secretly worship a Tibetan Buddhist master. After several generations of emperors, the secret was made public.

In the Qing Dynasty, the emperor publicly worshipped Tibetan Buddhist monks as his guru. The Shunzhi Emperor summoned the fifth Dalai Lama, but did not worship him as his guru.

Emperor Kangxi worshipped the second living Buddha Zhangjia as his guru; Emperor Yongzheng worshiped the second living Buddha Tuguan Ngawang Gyatso as his teacher; Emperor Qianlong worshiped the third living Buddha Zhangjia and the second living Buddha Tuguan as his teachers.

Emperor Qianlong was a very devout Tibetan Buddhist. One year, I visited Qianlong's tomb, Qingyu Mausoleum, in Beijing. The mural above the tomb is an underground Buddhist hall, full of Tibetan scriptures and Tibetan Buddhist statues. .

Since the Ming and Qing Dynasties, the emperors of all dynasties will worship a Tibetan Buddhist master. Starting from the second and third Zhangjia Living Buddha, Tibetan Buddhism has spread to many places in China.

There are several Tibetan Buddhist monasteries in Chengde, Hebei, such as the Little Potala Palace; Wutai Mountain has 32 Tibetan Buddhist monasteries in history, and Beijing also has several Tibetan Buddhist monasteries, and there are still, such as Lama Temple.

These monasteries of Tibetan Buddhism in the Han Dynasty are almost all monasteries of the Gelug sect.

51

The right view of the Gelug School is the right view of the Middle Way, which is learned through debating scriptures, paying equal attention to listening, thinking, cultivating, speaking, debating, and emphasizing.

Hearing: First of all, the Dharma must be consummated by listening to the Dharma.

As a disciple of the Gelug School, you must first learn the Dharma of the sutra. For an ordinary lama, it takes 15 years to learn through debating scriptures. Those with better skills also need to study for seven or eight years. It takes seven or eight years to learn the tantra method, and it takes more than twenty years in total.

Therefore, the monks of the Gelug School are very consummate in their study and reflection.

Contemplation: To practice by thinking.

The more you smell, the deeper and wider your thinking.

Xiu: The more you hear, the more things you cultivate. If you don’t know the Fa, you have nothing to cultivate.

Speak: Speak is to speak the scriptures.

Debate: The master of Tibetan Buddhism is like a teacher. He lectures every day, and monks also go to the Debating School to debate and study scriptures every day.

Writing: Writing is writing books and sayings.

Tibetan Buddhism, especially the Gelug School and the Kadam School, must meet three conditions for writing: First, the content to be written must first be inherited.

For example, if you want to write the four additions, you must first have the inheritance of the four additions; secondly, which method to write about, you must thoroughly understand the method; thirdly, when you really write, you must have the encouragement and persuasion of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas. Please, to write.

For example, when Master Tsongkhapa wrote "The Extensive Treatise on the Stages of the Path to Bodhi", all the lineage patriarchs appeared and encouraged Master Tsongkhapa to write "The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Bodhi Path".

Manjushri appeared three times in person to encourage Master Tsongkhapa. Under such circumstances, Master Tsongkhapa wrote "The Broad Treatise on the Stages of the Bodhi Path".

Some essential Dharma-doors cannot be written if Buddhas and Bodhisattvas are not allowed to write them.

There are these three conditions to write a book and say it, and you can't write it indiscriminately.

There are two types of writings, general commentaries on sutras and practice rituals.

For example, some ordinary explanations of sutras or sutras can be written by people who do not need to be highly accomplished.

However, some rituals cannot be written until they reach the level of Bodhisattva, and they must be cultivated to the level of Bodhisattva before they can be written.

What are the benefits of writing a graded Bodhisattva? The rituals written by the bodhisattvas of the rank contain his vows, the offerings in the rituals, etc. If we do not visualize them, but recite them, these things will also appear in front of the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas.

Therefore, until that achievement is achieved, one cannot write rituals without that vow. Only Buddhas and Bodhisattvas can write them, and ordinary people cannot.

Listening, thinking, cultivating, lecturing, debating, and writing are the tasks of the Gelug monks.

There are also differences between Tibetan and Chinese translations.

There have been 723 translators in Tibetan history, and the classics translated by these 723 translators are all the same, and there are few different versions.

But the Chinese are different. For example, there were eleven versions of the Heart Sutra, and now there are seven versions, which were translated by seven masters.

Xuanzang's translation, Kumarajiva's translation, Fayue's translation, etc., the text is different.

Tibetan Buddhism has also translated the Heart Sutra. How did you translate it? For example, suppose Master Kumarajiva is a translator in the Tibetan area. After he translated the first one, Master Xuanzang read it. If he found any defects, Xuanzang could only make a supplementary translation, not another version. , the translations are all the same.

Let's take another example of the "Praise of Tara". If the "Praise of Tara" in the Tibetan area was translated by ten translators, the first translator finished the translation, and after a period of time, the second translator Check to see if there are any omissions, whether the expression is clear, and if there are problems, add them. After adding, the original text is not allowed to be translated again. It must be placed in the tower and no longer circulated. After that, no further changes were made.

In the past, Tibetan areas, such as Samye Monastery and Sakya Monastery, had scripture translation institutes with many translators and panditas.

Moreover, the translator in the Tibetan area must be translated by two people, an Indian Panzhida and a translator from the Tibetan area.

54

Panzhida in India must be proficient in Tibetan, and translators in Tibetan areas must be proficient in Sanskrit.

After they have translated, they will hand it over to the Translation Institute. If there are a hundred panditas in the translation agency, everyone must read the hundred panditas. When they find any flaws, they will find these two translators together. For the revision, two translators and Pan Zhida worked together to translate it. After the revision was completed, everyone took turns to read it several times, and only after passing it all could it be sent out.

The translation in Tibetan areas is like this, so the translations of scriptures in Tibetan areas are almost always the same version.

There are no different versions, and this is what makes Tibetan translation of scriptures so special.

As mentioned earlier, Nalanda Temple in 1193 was destroyed by fire in India. Many great siddhas and masters fled to Tibetan areas, and they brought a lot of Sanskrit scriptures with them.

The translation institutes in Tibetan areas continue to translate, every year, every Sanskrit text.

Up to now, there are still many Sanskrit scriptures in Tibetan areas that have not been translated. Unfortunately, a lot of them were destroyed during the Cultural Revolution.

Since the establishment of Buddhism, the development in ancient India is mainly divided into four periods, namely the period of primitive Buddhism, the period of tribal Buddhism, the period of Mahayana Buddhism, and the period of Tantra.

Among them, the period of Mahayana Buddhism is divided into three stages: early, middle and late.

55

In the early days of Mahayana Buddhism in ancient India, there were many scriptures on Mahayana Buddhism, but there were relatively few works on the interpretation of scriptures.

Since the middle period of Mahayana Buddhism in ancient India, there have been many works on the interpretation of Buddhist scriptures.

For example, these masters such as Nagarjuna, Wusang, etc. were all masters in the middle stage of Mahayana Buddhism, and these masters wrote a lot of commentaries on Buddhist scriptures.

In the late period of Mahayana Buddhism in ancient India, there were more great siddhas.

For example, Yue Cheng Bodhisattva, Chen Na Bodhisattva, Dharma Bodhisattva, etc., were all masters in the late period of Mahayana Buddhism, and more theories on the interpretation of scriptures were published during this period.

Chinese Buddhism has a history of more than 2,100 years. When Buddhism entered China, it was the early stage of Mahayana Buddhism in ancient India.

Therefore, Chinese Buddhism began to translate classics in the early days of Mahayana Buddhism in ancient India. When it came to the middle and late stages of Mahayana Buddhism in ancient India, the masters in the Chinese believed that the scriptures and discussions of Mahayana Buddhism had all been translated satisfactorily. The translation also stopped.

When the translation of Chinese scriptures stopped, Buddhism had just entered the Tibetan area.

Tibetan Buddhism has a history of only 1,300 years, which is more than 700 years behind Chinese Buddhism.

Tibetan Buddhism only entered the Tibetan area in the middle and late stages of Mahayana Buddhism in ancient India, so the scriptures and treatises on Buddhism during this period were relatively complete.

56

It was at that time that Tibetan Buddhism translated the Tripitaka.

The Tripitaka of Tibetan Buddhism is divided into Ganyur and Denyur. The content of Ganyur is mainly the original Buddhist classics, including the Sutras and Vinayas of the Sutras and Tantras.

"Tengyur" is a commentary on Buddhist scriptures and tantras, and is a collection of Buddhist language interpretations and expositions by the later disciples of Buddha Shakyamuni.

What is the most complete translation of Tibetan Buddhism? Just on the subject.

Because the ancient Indian Mahayana Buddhism had few theories on time in the early stage, and there were many theories in the middle and late stages, Tibetan Buddhism translated all these theories.

Since the translation of Chinese Buddhism was in the early period of Mahayana Buddhism in ancient India, there are very few translated works.

As for the Madhyamika, there are only the treatises of Nagarjuna and his disciples, such as the Four Hundred Verses of the Madhyamika.

However, without the writings of the masters of the late Mahayana School of Mahayana Buddhism in ancient India, such as the works of the Bodhisattva Yuecheng, they were not translated into Chinese, because the translation of scriptures had stopped at that time.

These Madhyamika writings by Yuecheng Bodhisattva represent the views of the Madhyamika school, and the Madhyamika writings and interpretations of the Master of Discrimination and Nagarjuna represent the Madhyamika Self-Continuing School.

These are not found in the Tripitaka of Chinese Buddhism.

Chen Na and Fa said that the two commentators were the representatives of the "Shi Liang Lun" in the late period of Mahayana Buddhism in ancient India, but there is no work of these two scholars in the "Tripitaka" in Chinese.

57

Therefore, Tibetan Buddhism discusses this aspect in the Buddhist Dharma of the Tripitaka, and it is very complete.

12. Dharma Doors Common to All Sects
The above describes the founders and main dharmas of the major sects of Tibetan Buddhism, as well as the Dharma practiced by the major sects.

All sects have common methods, and there are also different methods. There are many different methods, and I can’t finish talking about them in a month. Now let’s talk about the methods that are common to all sects.

The common method is the three ways: the lower, the middle, and the upper.

It can be said that the essence of the 84,000 Dharma-doors is concentrated in the three ways. Many people do not know the order of cultivation. Which one should be cultivated first and which one should be cultivated later. Master Shido.

This is the order of practice, and all sects are the same.

Section 2 Features of Tibetan Buddhism
Tibetan Buddhism has five characteristics: complete teaching, complete inheritance, complete practice, complete preservation, and complete teaching.

58

1. The teaching method is complete
The first characteristic of Tibetan Buddhism is that the teachings are complete.

why do you say so? The Dharma of Tibetan Buddhism is divided into three parts: the Dharma of Theravada, the Dharma of the Mahayana Sutra, and the Dharma of the Mahayana Tantra.

The most complete Theravada Buddhism is the Southern Buddhism; the most complete Mahayana Buddhism is the Chinese Buddhism; the Mahayana, Tantric, and Theravada methods are all relatively complete is Tibetan Buddhism.

Because Tibetan Buddhism is a combination of esoteric and esoteric, the external practice of Theravada, the internal practice of Mahayana, and the second of the Tantric Buddhism.

Therefore, to learn Tibetan Buddhism, one must first learn the Theravada method. In the Theravada method, the thirty-seven path and the precepts of not liberation must be studied in detail.

The most essential things in all the Theravada Buddhism are included, plus the perfect practice of Sutra and Tantra. Therefore, the first characteristic of Tibetan Buddhism is the perfection of teaching methods.

In Chinese Buddhism, the teachings of the Xian sect are very complete, but there is no esoteric method; in Southern Buddhism, the teaching method of Theravada is very complete, but there is no Mahayana method, and there is no tantric method.

59

Second, the inheritance is complete
The second characteristic of Tibetan Buddhism is the complete inheritance. Tibetan Buddhism has five major inheritances: initiation, guidance, oral transmission, secret formulas, and precepts.

Buddhism has its inheritance regardless of southern, Tibetan, and Chinese traditions.

But Buddhism has gone through many trials and tribulations, and many traditions have been broken.

Especially in Chinese Buddhism, at the end of the Tang Dynasty, Emperor Wu of Tang destroyed the Fa three times, and there were several eradications of the Fa in other dynasties. There should be four or five times.

The Tibetan area also experienced a method of annihilation, that is, the annihilation of King Langdama.

Many lineages were broken, and only some of them survived. After that, many eminent monks and great virtues, such as Rinchen Sampo in Tibet, took the scriptures from India again and restored the lineage.

Venerable Atisha was invited again, and the inheritance was not greatly affected, but it was preserved.

Although Tibetan Buddhism also went through the era of the Cultural Revolution, the Cultural Revolution caused great damage to Tibetan Buddhist monasteries, but the inheritance had no effect.

During the Cultural Revolution, many masters in Tibetan areas went into caves, or hid in their family’s homes. For example, one of the seven masters I worshiped, Master Lobsang Dorje, was protected by the village without his cassocks. take off.

60

Another master, Master Gazang Qusong, was also protected by a village.

Dharma King Yeshe Gyatso was hiding in a cave, and people surreptitiously brought him meals.

In the 1980s, they were invited out by the villagers one by one, which had no effect on the inheritance.

We were very lucky. When I was studying at Ta'er Monastery in the 1980s, there were a lot of eminent monks and great virtues.

At that time, there were hundreds of eminent monks to choose from, and one could choose to worship this or that as a teacher.

This is not the case anymore. There are very few recognized great virtues in Tibetan areas.

There are two other teachers in Labrang Monastery, Master Huadan and Master Jiayang Gyatso. Master Jiayang Gyatso is the teacher of the 11th Panchen Lama. These two masters are recognized as eminent monks and great virtues.

Tibetan Buddhism has the characteristics of complete inheritance, first of all, the complete inheritance of precepts.

There are three major precepts in Buddhism: the precepts of no liberation, the precepts of bodhisattvas, and the precepts of tantra.

The Hinayana only has the precepts of different liberation. The Chinese tradition has the precepts of different liberation and the Bodhisattva. The Tibetan tradition adds a tantric precept on the basis of these two precepts. The inheritance of the three precepts is very complete.

The second is the success of oral inheritance.

For example, in the Tibetan Tripitaka, we all have oral transmissions, and the inheritance has never been interrupted.

An oral tradition is passed on from the master to the disciple. Every day the master and the disciple face each other, the master reads it every day, and the disciple listens every day.

The inheritance of sermons and empowerments is complete.

The inheritance of Tibetan Buddhism's teachings and empowerments is not broken. This is a characteristic of Tibetan Buddhism.

There is a difference between those who have an inheritance and those who do not. The Master who has an inheritance teaches the Heart Sutra and the one who does not have an inheritance is different.

Masters who do not have a lineage teach the "Heart Sutra" using their own wisdom. When a master who has a lineage teaches the Sutra, whatever the lineage Patriarch says, he does what he says, and he doesn't add his own understanding.

I have worshipped seven masters, and these seven masters were all disciples of the same master.

In front of five of them, I received the lineage of "The Extensive Treatise on the Stages of the Path to Bodhi", because they are all disciples of the same master, and they talk about the same thing, and even the examples are the same. .

3. Perfection of practice
The third characteristic of Tibetan Buddhism is the perfection of practice.

Southern Buddhism cultivates the precepts for liberation and the thirty-seven path.

Chinese Buddhism cultivates the precepts of separation and liberation, the precepts of Bodhisattva, compassion, bodhicitta, and six degrees of perfection.

Tibetan Buddhism practice is relatively complete: the external practice of the Hinayana method, the internal practice of the Mahayana Sutra method and the Tantric practice of the four tantras, and the practice of the three vehicle precepts of Biejie, Bodhisattva and Tantric.

Fourth, the preservation is complete
The fourth characteristic of Tibetan Buddhism is complete preservation.

Buddhism is very inclusive. No matter which religion or ethnic group you are with, you can get along very well and can be integrated. This is also a feature of Buddhism.

When Buddhism spread to Southeast Asian countries, all countries integrated their own culture into Buddhism, and Buddhism was more or less influenced by local culture.

When Buddhism was introduced to the Han, the Taoism and Confucian culture in the Han were also very prosperous. People integrated Buddhism with Taoism and Confucianism. Therefore, Buddhism itself will also be affected to some extent.

When Buddhism was introduced to Tibetan areas, there was no written language and no special culture was formed in Tibet, so Tibetan culture was formed on the basis of mature Buddhism.

Likewise, Tibetan is also formed on the basis of Sanskrit.

Therefore, Tibetan Buddhism has preserved the teachings of Buddha Shakyamuni more than 2,500 years ago in their original form. This is the fourth characteristic of Tibetan Buddhism.

63

5. The professor is successful
The courses of Buddhist study include sutras, tantras, and treatises. The Theravada scriptures and sutras taught by the Buddha himself are called sutras, and the tantra scriptures are called tantras.

The interpretations of Buddhist scriptures and tantras by bodhisattvas or Mahasiddhas are called sutras.

There are more Buddhist scriptures directly studied in Southern and Chinese Buddhism.

Tibetan Buddhism generally studies the sutras first, and then the sutras, because the content of the sutras is very deep and broad, and it is easier to understand the content of the sutras after studying the sutras.

Tibetan Buddhism mainly studies the Five Great Treatises, "The Broad Theory of the Bodhi Path", "The Broad Theory of the Tantric Path" and so on.

A treatise contains a lot of sutras, and if you study a treatise well, you will learn a lot of sutras well.

Therefore, Tibetan Buddhism advocates studying the theory first, then studying the scriptures, and then studying the continuum.

Tibetan Buddhism has the five perfections, the inheritance is pure, the sequence is complete, and at the same time, it integrates the essence of 84,000 methods. Therefore, it can cure the 84,000 kinds of troubles of modern people, and it is very suitable for lay people to practice.

The third section of Tibetan Buddhism and Tantric Tibetan Buddhism is a combination of esoteric and esoteric.

The Sutra method says:

64

Renunciation, Bodhicitta, and Six Paramitas are the five paths and ten places of the Bodhisattva Way; there are four tantric practices in tantra: the division of affairs, the division of practice, the division of yoga, and the division of supreme yoga. The combination of the two teachings of esoteric and esoteric is Tibetan Buddhism.

Tantra believes that man and nature are one.

The human body is a universe, and the method of combining it with the universe outside the body is the secret method.

There are the sun and the moon outside, and we also have two eyes on our faces; the earth outside has four continents, and our human body has limbs; what the outside earth has, we almost have our human body.

There are many flowers, plants and trees outside on the earth, and we also have a lot of hair on our bodies.

This is what the outer universe has, and the universe inside the human body actually has those things.

The universe outside the body has earth, water, fire, and wind; the universe inside the body also has earth, water, fire, and wind.

For example, the earth is our flesh; water is the blood that flows through us; heat is fire; and breath is wind.

How are the earth, water, fire, and wind outside the body connected with the earth, water, fire, and wind inside the body? How to absorb the energy of earth, water, fire, and wind from the outside into the energy of earth, water, fire, and wind in the body? How to balance it? Esoteric Law is about how the inner and outer universes are combined. Esoteric Buddhism is probably such a concept.

65

There are four secrets.

In the past, Chinese Buddhism also had Tantra. During the Tang Dynasty, Chinese Buddhism was divided into eight sects, among which was the Tantra founded by Master Bukong.

The Han Tradition of Tantra is mainly the first department of the four departments of the Tibetan Tradition of Tantra. What methods are there in the department? For example, Vajra Vajra and Dakokutian, these belong to the tantric practices of Chinese Buddhism, and Tibetan Buddhism also has these practices.

The content of Tibetan Buddhism is the combination of explicit and esoteric, with equal emphasis on both.

Therefore, when we study and cultivate, we must first learn the Dharma of the Xian sect, and then practice the Dharma of the Tantric sect. The study of Tibetan Buddhism is like this.

Chapter 5 "Changing Sutras" Overview
Section 1 The purpose and order of learning Buddhism
First, we must understand the purpose of learning Buddhism.

There are different purposes for studying Buddhism. Some people study Buddhism in order to be reborn in a pure land in the next life, some people are in order to obtain the fruit of human and heaven in the next life, some people are for liberation in this life, and some people study Buddhism in order to become a Buddha. There are many different types. Purpose.

However, whether it is liberation or becoming a Buddha, one must cultivate step by step.

Learning Buddhism and cultivating need to have a sequence, and a sequence can be achieved, and sequence is very important.

If there is no sequence, there can be no achievement.

If there is a step-by-step practice, first, it can eliminate the disobedience. On the way to become a Buddha, there are few obstacles, peace, and health.

Second, you can accumulate good fortune, eliminate karma, and even achieve something.

Without orderly cultivation, you can only accumulate a little fortune and eliminate a little karma, and there will be no achievement.

67

You will not cut off your afflictions, you will not get renunciation, you will not get bodhicitta.

If there is a stage of practice, no matter whether it is a lay person or a monk, it will be successful.

In the past, in the history of Tibetan Buddhism, there were many achievements in the life of the lay family. For example, the master of the Kadam school, Chung Dunpa, became a Buddha in his life; Buddha.

The great siddhi master Marpa of the Kagyu sect also practiced at home. Of the five Sakya Patriarchs, except for two who were monks, the other three practiced at home.

So, family members can also be successful.

Now, many lay people feel that we have no hope of achieving success in our practice at home, we just recite the Buddha's words, get some blessings, and eliminate karma.

This kind of thinking is wrong, don’t be so desperate, all lay disciples can achieve, and even become Buddhas.

Everyone should know the concept of achievement. If you get renunciation, you will be considered an achievement. If you have obtained bodhicitta, it will be considered an achievement. Anyone who has achieved the right path, such as the five paths of Buddhism, the path of accumulation, the path of practice, the path of vision, the path of cultivation, Without learning the Tao, entering one of the Taos can be said to be an achievement.

However, to achieve success, you must practice step by step.

For example, to build a high-rise building, the first and second floors must be built in this way. It is impossible to build a building without this order, so the order is very important.

68

Some people ask: Isn't it said that there are people who put down the butcher's knife and become a Buddha on the ground, and then achieve and become a Buddha right away? There are such people, but who is this kind of person? It refers to the achievements in previous life practice.

For example, if you have attained the Dao of Accumulation in your previous life, you don’t need to practice the Dao of Accumulation in this life, you can start from the Dao of Addition, and this kind of disciple can achieve it right now.

Ninety-nine percent of the disciples at home today are not such disciples, they are ordinary people among ordinary people. They must take it step by step, and don’t think about achieving and enlightening all at once. There is no possibility of this.

Step by step, you will definitely get it, such as climbing a mountain, you must climb step by step!

According to Master Tsongkhapa's "Extensive Treatise on the Steps of the Path of Bodhi" or "A Brief Treatise on the Steps of the Path to Bodhi", first practice the lower sage path, then the middle sage path, then the upper sage path, and then enter the second stage of Tantric Buddhism, and then Becoming a Buddha is such a sequence.

In our simplest terms, the order is two: the first, to cultivate the consummation of the world; the second, to cultivate beyond the world.

This is two processes and two times.

The first step is to cultivate the consummation of the world.

What does the perfection of the world mean? It is the Seven Virtues of Humanity and Heaven that are pursued by the clergy.

69

The seven virtues of man and nature are: a healthy life, a long life, a wealthy life, a solemn life, a persuasive life, a wise life, and a loving life.

If one cultivates such a consummate life in this world, the accumulation of good fortune will be very fast.

A single sentence can call on many people to recite the Buddha and accumulate blessings.

In other words, if you can achieve the seven virtues of human beings and heaven, accumulate good fortune, and eliminate karmic obstacles quickly.

From the perspective of us Buddhists, the Panchen Lama of the past dynasties is a life with the seven virtues of man and nature.

There are many other masters who also possess the seven virtues of human and heaven, which is very important.

We must first know that learning Buddhism requires a healthy body.

A healthy life is very important. Many people say that you don't care about your body when you study Buddhism. This statement is wrong.

Learning Buddhism also requires longevity.

The longer the lifespan, the longer the practice time, the longer the practice time, the greater the possibility of achievement, and the greater the possibility of becoming a Buddha.

Learning Buddhism requires wealth.

At the beginning of learning Buddhism, we need to cultivate the world to perfection, so we need wealth.

Some people have some misunderstandings, saying that studying Buddhism is not about seeing through and letting go? It is to see through and let go, but on the understanding level of seeing through and letting go, there are two meanings. One of them means letting go of troubles, not letting go of wealth, family, etc. You should know this.

Do we need wealth to study Buddhism? Wealth is needed in the beginning.

70

When I first started learning Buddhism, I didn't have the wisdom to open up, and I didn't have the power to meditate. There was wealth that could be used to accumulate blessings.

For example, building a Buddha statue with one's own wealth can accumulate great blessings.

Making offerings to a collective practice center can also accumulate great blessings. Therefore, we need wealth to study Buddhism.

There is a little difference between Tantra and Xianzong. Tantric practice is joyful cultivation, and Xianzong is penance. Therefore, Tantric does not exclude wealth.

The secret law talks about the five gods of wealth: white god of wealth, yellow god of wealth, red god of wealth, black god of wealth, green god of wealth, why are there so many gods of wealth? We cultivators need wealth, so the Buddha also talked about these Gods of Wealth and the Dharma Doors of these Gods of Wealth.

To study Buddhism requires a solemn appearance.

If you reach the point of transcending the world, it doesn't matter whether your appearance is dignified or not, but when you start cultivating the consummation of the world, you still need a dignified appearance.

Therefore, Medicine Buddha made twelve vows, one of which is "to look like a dignified being with me", which is to hope that the appearance of all living beings will become as solemn as Buddhas and Bodhisattvas.

When Venerable Atisha came to the Tibetan area, many great masters in the Tibetan area went to greet the Venerable. Among them was a Master named Keton, who had a very solemn appearance.

One morning, he went to a family for alms.

At that time, a woman was milking a yak in the yard. The mage threw the tin stick in his hand to the ground, and the yak was so frightened that it suddenly ran away and kicked the milk to the ground.

71

The woman was very angry, so she grabbed a handful of ashes and wanted to scatter it on the monk's face to vent her anger.

When she came to the monk, she saw that it was a very solemn master, so she threw out the ashes and said, "Master, please come and eat at home! This is the role of the solemn appearance.

When saving sentient beings, it is especially necessary to have a solemn appearance.

When the disciples saw the dignified Master, it was easy for them to have confidence and respect.

If the master has a bad appearance, such as scars on the mouth, slanted eyes, crooked nose, etc., although the practice is good, there are still obstacles in the heart of ordinary people, and it is difficult to develop a respectful attitude.

When Nagarjuna Bodhisattva taught the emptiness method, there were very few disciples who heard the understanding of emptiness, but there were many people who came to see Nagarjuna, because Nagarjuna's appearance was very solemn, and no one who saw Nagarjuna did not take refuge. This is also a convenience for saving sentient beings.

To cultivate a solemn appearance, one should recite the holy name of the Eight Tathagatas of the Medicine Master more often.

The appearance is solemn, and people will feel a very comfortable feeling when they see it.

But understand that being dignified isn't just about being pretty.

Learning Buddhism requires persuasion.

That is to say, the words have to be persuasive, and persuasive is not the same.

Learning Buddhism requires wisdom.

A wise life is very important. Wisdom can eliminate pain and eliminate troubles.

72

Learning Buddhism requires freedom and love.

It is freedom and the power to love and influence others.

There are three types of karma: present, coming, and coming.

Great good and bad karma or long-term karma, the result is present; medium good and bad karma is coming; small good and bad karma is coming and coming.

Great blessings and long-term good deeds can be achieved in this life, so cultivating the consummation of the world can be successful.

At the beginning of learning Buddhism, the body is very important.

Buddha Shakyamuni preached prostration in Tantric Buddhism.

Prostration can not only accumulate blessings, but also eliminate karma, and can also exercise.

The Buddha also asked us to cultivate the Eight Tathagatas of Medicine, just to tell us that a healthy body is very important.

Many people have such a misunderstanding: since one has studied Buddhism, the body is not important, the most important thing is the Three Jewels.

The Three Jewels are important, but the body is just as important. The body is a boat that sails through the sea of ​​suffering, and it cannot be damaged.

In addition, longevity is also very important, so Buddha Shakyamuni talked about the Buddha of Longevity and the Dharma Door of Longevity.

The second stage is to practice transcending the world.

When I first started to study Buddhism, I cultivated for the perfection of the world. When the practice in the world is more perfect and satisfied, it is natural that you will not be interested in the worldly law. When you reach this realm, the time to cultivate beyond the world will come.

73

To see through and let go at this time is to let go of wealth, family, and attachment to small families, thinking that all sentient beings in the six realms are their parents and relatives, let go of everything that is selfish and self-interested, and go beyond the world.

When you reach transcendence of the world, it will be completely different, your heart will be opened, and you will be able to accommodate the world and the living beings of the six realms.

At this time, there is no need for wealth, and you can let go of wealth, and let go of things you used to be greedy for.

However, the wonderful thing is that after letting go, we no longer pursue wealth, but wealth naturally follows us in turn.

Because our hearts are opened, it will be different. It can be said that we have become the master of the world. At this time, if we tell the cockroach to get out of the room, it will go out and be obedient, which is completely different.

Now we need to cultivate the four immeasurable minds and open our minds. When our minds are truly opened, we don’t need to pursue those things, and what we need will come naturally.

To open your heart, you need to cultivate patience. Now you can’t stand being scolded by others; you can’t stand resentment; you can’t even stand it if you don’t show a good face.

When my heart is open, I won’t feel uncomfortable when being scolded by others; I won’t feel uncomfortable when I’m beaten; I won’t feel uncomfortable if I don’t show a good face, on the contrary, I will feel very happy.

At this level, no one will do that to you.

74

For example, Venerable Atisha said that there were only two people in the world who dared to scold him at that time, and these two people were the creditors of his past life.

Although Venerable Atisha has achieved success, these two people still have deep resentment towards him. As long as Venerable Atisha does something they don't like, they will immediately scold: You are wrong, and that is not right.

Venerable Atisha said, these two people are my teachers of forbearance and my masters.

Therefore, when you have cultivated to the point of transcending the world, you will hardly find anyone who scolds you or who blames you. Even if someone really scolds you and blames you, you will be very happy.

In fact, both of them later converted to Atisha and their practice was accomplished.

Right now, we have not cultivated to the level of transcending the world, and many things that are transcended in the Buddhist scriptures are not suitable for us right now.

We have not come to the time when we don't want wealth, but we should use wealth to accumulate blessings and use wealth to support our life.

But when you transcend, you don’t have to support yourself in this life. Beings in the six realms, the gods, dragons, and eight divisions will make offerings to you. This is different.

The stages of practice are the two processes of consummation and transcendence of the world mentioned above.

The consummation of the world is the early stage of cultivating liberation, and transcending the world is the first to be liberated, and the second to become a Buddha.

75

The content of the second chapter "Changing the scriptures often"
"Chang Chan Sutra" includes 84,000 Dharma Doors. If you read "Chang Chan Sutra" every day, you have read 84,000 Dharma Doors.

The content of "Changchan Sutra" is very broad and very deep, including all the content of the five major theories. ” and “Lun Lun”, which mainly talk about the 84,000 dharmas of the Xian sect.

To practice tantra, one must first understand the method of sutra, which is the foundation of tantra.

Some people say that reciting the Four Refugees means cultivating tantra, and cultivating tantra is not that simple. You can only practice tantra after you have received empowerment; you can only practice tantra when you practice the stages of the tantra path; when you practice the stages of birth and perfection , it is considered to be the tantric method of the Supreme Yoga Department of Tantra.

Before this, the rituals of holding secret mantras and reciting secret methods just planted a seed of secret cultivation.

"Changing Sutras" includes refuge texts, Bodhi mind texts, four immeasurable mind texts, four great vows, opening sutras, Dharma collection essential sutras, postscripts, Huayan verses, karma, diamond verses, middle insight verses, Prajna verse, Dharmakaya verse.

79

Chapter 6 Refuge

Take refuge in the guru, take refuge in the Buddha, take refuge in the law, take refuge in the Sangha

There are three refuges and four refuges.

Southern Buddhism and Chinese Buddhism are three conversions.

Tibetan Buddhism is a dual practice of esoteric and esoteric practice, so here we are talking about the four refuges.

The Four Refuges refer to taking refuge in the guru, taking refuge in the Buddha, taking refuge in the Dharma, and taking refuge in the Sangha.

Among the 84,000 Dharma doors taught by Buddha Shakyamuni, the Four Refugees are the most important.

Believers are Buddhist disciples after taking refuge in the Three Jewels, but they are not if they do not take refuge.

Although people who have not taken refuge can learn the wisdom of Buddhism, they cannot learn the complete Dharma. Why? Because there are many skills, oral transmissions, and secret formulas in the inheritance, those who do not take refuge will have no inheritance, and those who have not received the inheritance cannot learn the complete Dharma.

80

There are two types of Refuge: Refuge with precepts and Refuge without precepts.

Taking refuge with precepts means taking the five precepts while taking refuge.

The majority of Chinese people take refuge with precepts, while Tibetan and Southern Buddhism have more refugees without precepts.

Ninety-nine percent of people in Tibetan areas have converted to Buddhism, and less than 5 percent have converted with precepts.

Eighty-five percent of the people of Southern Buddhism in Myanmar and Sri Lanka believe in Buddhism, and less than 3 percent take refuge with precepts, and the rest are all converts without precepts.

There are also refugees without precepts in China, but there are more refugees with precepts.

Taking refuge with precepts requires five precepts: no killing, no stealing, no sexual misconduct, no lying, and no drinking. These five precepts cannot be broken.

Taking refuge without precepts, after you have taken refuge, as long as your belief in the Three Jewels persists, you can still do whatever you originally did, and slowly turn towards goodness and change.

The four refuges are about: the place of refuge, the cause of refuge, the merits of the Three Jewels, how to meditate, the merits of refuge, etc.

The content of the Four Refuges is very extensive, and even great Geshes and Great Masters dare not say that they fully understand the Four Refugees.

81

The first place of refuge
There are three treasures of guru, Buddha, Dharma and Sangha.

1. Guru
A guru is a teacher who teaches scriptures and Dharma. A guru who has at least the following five virtues is a perfect guru.

The five virtues are: Purity of Precepts, Comprehension of Dharma, Great Compassion, Purity of Tradition, and Comprehension of Emptiness.

1. The precepts are pure
A person who breaks the precepts cannot be a guru.

If the guru is a monk, the monk's two hundred and fifty-three precepts must be pure, and at least the four root precepts must be pure.

If you take the bodhisattva vows or the tantric vows, the bodhisattva vows have eighteen fundamental vows and forty-six branch vows, and the tantric vows have fourteen fundamental vows and eight branch vows, all of which must be pure.

2. Fully understand the Dharma
If you only understand the sutras but not the tantras, you will slander the tantras;

Those who only understand tantra but do not understand sutras will also slander sutras.

Not understanding the Dharma, and slandering the Dharma is a great sin.

Such a teacher cannot lead his disciples to the right path, so the teacher must be proficient in 84,000 kinds of dharmas, and must have a very complete understanding of the sutras.

3. Great mercy and great compassion
The guru treats every disciple with the same love as a parent treats their only child, and loves every sentient being, and has a great wish to let sentient beings in the six realms be free from suffering and the causes of suffering.

4. Inheritance is pure and complete
Before the Tang Dynasty, there were all the inheritances of sutra and esoteric Buddhism.

The Four Refugees we are learning today were first passed on from Shakyamuni Buddha to Manjushri, then to Nagarjuna Bodhisattva, Yuecheng Bodhisattva, Venerable Atisha, and then to Master Tsongkhapa and Kezhujie. Then it was passed on to the Great Dharma King Rako Rinpoche, Dharma King Yongzin, and then to me. My seven teachers are all disciples of Rako Rinpoche.

Here, a special introduction to our Dharma lineage.

The inheritance of our Prajna Sutra started from Buddha Shakyamuni, and it is the 46th generation to me.

It also includes the inheritance of the Four Refugees.

The lineage masters of the past dynasties said here:

Ngawang Gyatso.
What is Inheritance Purity? Among the lineage teachers, if a certain teacher violates his own teacher, the lineage is not pure; if the faith in the teacher has not been withdrawn, the lineage is pure.

It is very important to have a lineage and the lineage is pure. The Dharma of the lineage is very powerful, and it is different in every aspect.

84

It should be noted that there are many false lineages in the current Buddhist world.

Some people say that his Dharma came down from the sky, or was dug up somewhere, which is a fake inheritance; there are people who visualize Buddhas and Bodhisattvas teaching the Dharma to themselves in front of a Buddha statue, and then recite the scriptures. Or rituals, saying that one has obtained the inheritance of a certain method, which is also a false inheritance.

Some people say that they dreamed that Buddhas and Bodhisattvas gave themselves empowerment and teachings, and said that they had obtained the inheritance of a certain Dharma. This is also a false inheritance.

When a bodhisattva of the rank is practising the dream yoga method of the consummation stage, the Buddha or Bodhisattva in the dream is the real Buddha and Bodhisattva. At this time, the Dharma door and empowerment passed on by the Buddha and Bodhisattva can be said to have been passed down.

However, this kind of inheritance can only be passed on when the inheritance of this method is broken. If it is not broken, the inheritance cannot be passed on in a dream.

For practitioners below the rank of Bodhisattva, what they dream of in their dreams cannot be considered inheritance.

There are five kinds of lineages. All lineages must be passed on face-to-face in front of the guru. The Dharma transmitted through the Internet, telephone, video, audio and video recording cannot be regarded as lineage, but it is possible to learn the Dharma through these.

85

understand emptiness
As a teacher, there is no requirement to realize emptiness, but one should be able to truly understand emptiness in words.

A guru who possesses the five virtues is the guru we take refuge in.

There are many teachers, living Buddhas, Dharma kings and Rinpoche in the current society, but some living Buddhas are not necessarily qualified to teach the Dharma, because they do not necessarily have the five virtues of a teacher in this life. The first life of a living Buddha must be a teacher. , but this life is not necessarily a guru, so is Rinpoche.

When we study Buddhism, we must worship a guru, who is the root of the Three Jewels.

The essence of the Fa is the teacher, and only after the teacher has taught the Fa can you learn the Fa and cultivate the Fa.

Once you get bodhicitta in practicing the Dharma, you become a bodhisattva and even a sangha. Therefore, the root of a sangha is your guru.

The guru taught the Dharma, practiced bravely and diligently, and finally became a Buddha. Therefore, the root of a Buddha is also a guru.

When we recite the four refuges, we recite the guru, then the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Sangha.

Many people don't know why taking refuge with the guru is in the first place, because the guru is the root of the Three Jewels, so the first object we take refuge in is the guru.

86

2. Buddha
A Buddha is a person who has cut off the two obstacles, the purest body, speech, and mind, a person who is fully enlightened and omniscient, a person who has obtained the four perfect bodies, and a person with the most complete blessings and wisdom.

The Buddha understands all suffering and the causes of suffering, understands the suffering and afflictions of sentient beings in the six realms, and understands the methods to resolve them.

The Buddhas mentioned by the Xianzong refer to the Buddhas of the ten directions and three times, such as Shakyamuni Buddha and Amitabha Buddha.

The Buddha mentioned in Tantra includes four deities: the deity of the affairs department, such as the five-nature Manjushri, the thousand-hand Guanyin, the twenty-one Tara, etc.; the deity of the line of action, such as Vairocana Bodhi Buddha, etc.; the deity of the yoga department, such as the Great Sun Tathagata Etc.; the deities of the Supreme Yoga Department, such as Mahavira, Kalachakra, etc., include all the Buddhas of the manifest and tantric.

3. Law
Dhamma refers to teaching and proof.

The teachings refer to 84,000 dharmas. People have 84,000 kinds of afflictions, and there are 84,000 dharmas to deal with afflictions. Therefore, the more dharmas you learn, the better, and the more you can deal with people's afflictions. .

The realization of the Dharma refers to the enlightenment that practitioners should have, such as precepts, concentration, wisdom, and the five paths.

87

Dharma, to put it simply, is a method, a way to get rid of suffering and get happiness, a way to stay away from suffering, and a way to get happiness.

After people have truly practiced for a period of time, they will really become happy. It is the kind of happiness that comes naturally. This is because of the insight of practice and the blessing of Buddha power.

Bhutan is recognized as the happiest country in the world, and the people there are the happiest. Although Bhutan's material living conditions are not that good, Bhutanese have the most smiles.

The most frowning is often people in developed countries, where there is too much pressure and too much competition.

Meditation will slowly increase happiness.

One of my disciples has depression.

After taking refuge, after almost three years of practice, the depression was cured.

When she shared it once, she said: Master, I used to go to the park and others would think it was beautiful when they saw the flowers, but I didn't feel that way at all, no matter what kind of clothes I wore, I didn't have a good feeling, nor Feeling beautiful, after taking refuge, I insisted on reciting "The Twenty-One Mother's Praise Sutra" for three years. One day I went downstairs and saw the flowers in the garden. Suddenly, I felt that there was a flower that bloomed very beautifully.

Since then, I have gradually discovered that there are still many beautiful things in the world, and there are things that interest me, and the world is beautiful.

88

Four, monk
The Sanskrit word for monk is Sangha, which is translated as Hehe, and sometimes translated as monk.

Those who realize emptiness and heavenly beings who realize emptiness are all monks; monks in Hinayana refer to practitioners who have attained the four stages of Arahantship; monks in Mahayana Buddhism are bodhisattvas from one place to ten places, and monks in Tantra are monks. Earth Bodhisattvas, Dakinis, Dakinis, warriors, brave mothers, transcendent Dharma protectors, etc.

The four ordinary monks can also represent the sangha, but they are not really sangha.

The second reason for taking refuge
Why do we take refuge? What kind of attitude do you take refuge in? Some people are for liberation, some are for the sake of becoming a Buddha to save sentient beings, and some are for the sake of health and success in doing things. No matter what the purpose is, it is possible to take refuge. There are thousands of reasons for taking refuge.

There are two basic reasons for taking refuge in the Three Jewels: one is the fear of the three evil realms; the other is the confidence in the Three Jewels.

These two reasons are the reason for the conversion of the lower clergy, and they are also the fundamental reasons for conversion.

Only when these two causes are possessed can one truly take refuge and truly enter into Buddhism.

89

These two reasons are the minimum conditions for entering Buddhism.

Some people take refuge in the Three Jewels because of illness, while others take refuge because they are broke, and take refuge in order to live a long life.

Being able to take refuge in the Three Jewels is a good thing, and you can get the blessings of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas, but these are not the real motivation of taking refuge.

Of the three evil realms, no matter which one you fall into, you will suffer a lot of pain. If you think deeply about these sufferings, a fear will arise.

Think again: in the face of the fear of falling into the evil realm, who can save himself? Only the Guru Three Jewels! If we go to hell, the Buddha can save us, this is the Buddha's treasure; the Dharma friend can recite the sutras to save us, it is the Dharma treasure; the Bodhisattva can save us, it is the Sangha's treasure.

Therefore, to take refuge in the Three Jewels, from this moment onwards, the heart of taking refuge in the Three Jewels arises.

Many people who study Buddhism, after studying Buddhism for a long time, feel that they still have many obstacles and problems. Why? Just because the heart has not really taken refuge, but only verbally, that is, following the guru to recite the four refuge texts three times, thinking that this is the way to take refuge, but there is no real fear of the evil realm and confidence in the Three Jewels.

If you have the intention of taking refuge in the lower class, and truly take refuge in the Three Jewels of the Guru, you will definitely receive more powerful and fast blessings from the Three Jewels.

Karma and troubles will also decrease rapidly.

The reason for the conversion of the zhongshi Tao is the fear of the six realms of reincarnation.

Not only is there a fear of falling into the evil realm, but also the pain of the human realm and the realm of the heavens.

Then think about it again: in the suffering of the six realms of reincarnation, only the guru, the Three Jewels, can save us.

Believing in the Three Jewels of the Guru is the second reason for the zhongshi Tao to take refuge.

The reason for taking refuge in Shangshi Tao is that they cannot bear the suffering of all beings in the six realms of reincarnation.

In the six realms of samsara, there are gross pains and fine pains. In the middle of the Taoist way, you are only afraid of the gross pains. When you go to the advanced way of life, you are also afraid of the most subtle pains, and you will be afraid of the subtle pains caused by the obstacles of knowledge. , and realized that the only one who can save all living beings and break through the obstacles of their own knowledge is the Three Jewels of the Guru, which is the reason for the refuge of the Guru.

The real refuge is to learn, through learning, to understand the cause of refuge, the object of refuge, the amount of refuge, the virtues and benefits of refuge after refuge.

After understanding these six aspects, we can understand what refuge is.

The most basic real conversion we are talking about now refers to the conversion of the lower clergy.

There are two reasons for taking refuge, one is to take refuge because of the fear of falling into the lower realms; the other is to take refuge because of the faith in the guru and the Three Jewels.

In order to obtain a human body full of human, heaven and seven virtues in the next life and not fall into the three evil realms in the next life, the lower sages are afraid that they will suffer the sufferings of the three evil realms. To become a Buddha.

Section 3 The Merit of the Three Treasures

The merits of the Three Jewels are: Buddha's merit, Dharma's merit, and Sangha's merit.

1. The merits of Buddha
The merits of the Buddha include the merits of body, speech, mind and career.

1. The merits of the Buddha's body
The Buddha's body has thirty-two appearances and eighty solemn appearances, namely, "hands and feet are rounded, and the soles of the feet are like tortoise belly" and other thirty-two appearances, and the Buddha's claws are purple and gold.

The praise of Buddha's merit recorded in "Yu Zan" says:

The appearance is dignified and dignified, and the wonderful eyes are nectar, like the cloudless autumn sky, and the stars are solemn.

Nengren is golden in color, and the dharma robes are strictly covered, which is equivalent to the golden mountain top, bound by the clouds.

Respected parents without strict ornaments, the face wheel full of aurora, Li Yun full moon wheel, and no one can match him.

The wonderful lotus in the mouth is the same as the lotus in the sun, when the bee sees doubts, it should be turned like a hanging rope.

Zun's mask is golden, and the white teeth are sharp, like the pure autumn moonlight, shining into the golden mountain gap.

The right hand should be offered, decorated with a special wheel, soothing with the hand, and the fear of life and death.

When Nengren marches, his feet are like wonderful lotuses, printing and painting this ground, how can the lotus garden be beautiful?

2. Buddha's speech merits
There are sixty-four kinds of merits of the Buddha's speech.

When the Buddha taught the scriptures, different people asked different questions, and the Buddha could answer all the questions with just one "A" character.

He never tires of listening to the Dharma taught by the Buddha, and every time he listens to it, he gains incredible results.

People with different languages ​​ask different questions at the same time, and the Buddha can answer different questions in different languages ​​with a single "A" character.

As said in "Puxian Xingxiangpin":

93

The Heavenly Dragon, Yaksha, Kuvanta, and even human beings and non-human beings, all the speeches of all living beings, all speak with various sounds.

And in the tantra it says:

Although they say one voice, they are different.

Master Tsongkhapa also said:

All sentient beings in all the worlds, inquire into doubts at one time, do everything in front of each one, their body and speech are solemn and appear at the same time, even though they are doing business and resting separately.

When the Buddha preached the scriptures, the Buddha's voice could be heard clearly no matter in the front row or the back row.

In the past, Living Buddha Xingsa went to Kham to teach Kalachakra empowerment, and a deaf person also attended. During the dharma meeting, the deaf and dumb person suddenly found that they could hear the voice of the living Buddha preaching the scriptures, and they could also speak, and they were very happy.

On the second day, he wanted to hear more clearly, so he went to sit in front, but the sound was exactly the same as the sound he heard on the first day, which shows that the blessing of the Buddha's words was very powerful.

Other language merits, such as "Hundred and Fifty Praises" say:

Guan Zun's face is lovely, and from what he heard, the extremely harmonious and elegant voice, like the moon's nectar.

94

Reverence can be quiet, greed is like a rain cloud.

Pulling out the venomous snake is equivalent to the wonderful winged bird.

Destroys extreme ignorance, obscures like sunlight,

By destroying my slow mountain, it is also waiting for King Kong.

Seeing righteousness without deceit, without fault therefore obeying,

Good affixes are easy to understand, and respectful words are good to say.

The first time I hear the words of the venerable one, I can capture the mind of those who hear it,

If right thinking is next, it will also eliminate all greed and delusion.

To congratulate all lacks, all liberations return,

Let the musicians get bored and leave, and respect the words commensurately.

Those who can produce wisdom rejoice, those who can increase wisdom,

Those who can destroy the shadows, these words benefit all living beings.

3. Buddha's Intentional Merit
In the major teachings, the merits and virtues of the Buddha's mind are described as: ten powers, eighteen uncommon dharmas, and twenty-one wisdom without omissions.

To put it simply, the merits of Buddha's mind can be divided into two types: wisdom merits and compassion merits.

Wisdom and merit, Buddha Shakyamuni can see all the dharmas clearly, just like contemplating the Amara fruit in the hands.

In "Zan Ying Zan" says:

The World-Honored Dharma of the Fallen Time, all species are born from the root, like the sour fruit in the palm of the hand, it is the state of mind and action.

All dharmas are moving and not moving, if they are one or more, they are like the wind in the sky, and there is nothing to hinder the respect.

Compassion and merit, Buddha's love for sentient beings in the six realms is countless times greater than a mother's love for her child who is seriously ill.

No matter how deeply we cherish ourselves, it cannot be compared to a fraction of the Buddha's compassion for every sentient being.

Moreover, the compassion of the Buddha is different from our compassion, which increases and decreases. The Buddha does not have compassion when he sees the suffering beings; Also never stop.

4. The merits of the Buddha's career
In addition to great compassion, great wisdom, and great wisdom, Buddha also has the merits of ability and perfection.

Therefore, the Buddha can save all sentient beings.

As long as the karma of sentient beings arrives, the Buddha will surely save them without a moment's delay.

2. Dharma Merit
Dharma is the way to get rid of suffering.

The virtue of Dharma is to let sentient beings cut off their afflictions, escape from the sea of ​​suffering, and realize emptiness; it can also make people feel calm and open their hearts.

96

When we do things, when our mentality is balanced, we will not be so impatient, we will endure humiliation and tolerance, and know that to tolerate others is to tolerate ourselves.

3. Sangha’s merits
Sangha is also called Sangha in a broad sense. Sangha includes Bodhisattvas, Arahants, and Dharma protectors.

1. The merits of the Bodhisattva
The Bodhisattva of the First Land cut off the obstacles of discriminating afflictions and discriminating knowledge, realized emptiness, and obtained the five supernatural powers.

The Bodhisattva of the First Land has twelve hundred merits after he emerges from concentration: in an instant, he can see hundreds of Buddhas, he can obtain the blessings of hundreds of Buddhas, he can reach hundreds of pure lands, he can transform into hundreds of pure lands, he can shake hundreds of worlds, and he can live in hundreds of kalpas. He can know the causes and conditions of a hundred kalpas, enter a hundred kinds of meditation, teach a hundred dharmas, save a hundred sentient beings, transform a hundred incarnations, and transform a hundred dependents for each incarnation.

Every time a Bodhisattva enters a place, his merit increases a hundred times over that of the previous Bodhisattva.

For example, a bodhisattva in two places can see ten thousand buddhas in a moment, a bodhisattva in three places can see a million buddhas in a moment, a bodhisattva in four places can see 100 million Buddhas in a moment, a bodhisattva in five places can see tens of billions of buddhas in a moment, and a bodhisattva in six places can see tens of millions of Buddhas in one moment. Seeing trillions of Buddhas, up to the bodhisattvas of the ten places.

The same goes for the growth of other merits.

There are nine grades of inborn afflictions, and nine grades of inborn knowledge obstacles.

There are big, medium and small afflictions for major afflictions, large, medium and small afflictions for medium afflictions, and large, medium and small afflictions for small afflictions.

When two obstacles are broken, they are removed in sequence according to their size.

The bodhisattvas of the second ground cut off the great afflictions and the hindrances of knowledge, the bodhisattvas of the third ground cut off the great afflictions and the hindrances of the knowledge, the bodhisattvas of the fourth ground cut off the great and small afflictions and the hindrances of the knowledge, and the bodhisattvas of the fifth ground cut off the great afflictions and the hindrances of the knowledge. The bodhisattvas of the sixth ground cut off the hindrances of middle afflictions and the hindrances of knowledge, the bodhisattvas of the seventh ground cut off the hindrances of medium and small afflictions and the hindrances of knowledge, the bodhisattvas of the eighth ground cut off the hindrances of small and great afflictions and the hindrances of knowledge, and the bodhisattvas of the nine grounds cut off the hindrances of small and medium afflictions and hindrances of knowledge. , The Bodhisattvas of the Ten Grounds cut off the obstacles of small afflictions and obstacles of knowledge.

2. The merits of an arahant
Arahants have cut off the obstacles of afflictions, have the same wisdom as the bodhisattvas of the seven places, and have obtained six supernatural powers and various meditations.

Arahants have the same compassion as a mother to all living beings, but they do not have the same compassion as a father. Father-like compassion means taking the responsibility to lead all beings from suffering to happiness.

98

3. The virtues of the supernatural guardian deity
The transcendent Dharma protector can do four kinds of deeds, and can protect the Dharma and practitioners.

Xi Zeng Huai Pu: stop disasters, increase merit, love sentient beings, subdue demons and wicked sentient beings.

Section 4 How to Practice the Four Refugees

Visualize that there is an eight-petal lotus on your head, and in the middle of the lotus is the sitting Buddha Sakyamuni. The Buddha's heart emits a white light, welcoming the guru to the Three Jewels.

Guru includes root guru and lineage guru. Sangha include all Buddhas, Bodhisattvas, warriors, brave mothers, etc., and they are integrated into the body of the Buddha.

Then visualize the grain field, the ritual is:

There is no difference between happiness and emptiness. In the vast emptiness, Samantabhadra makes offerings to the sea of ​​clouds.

The branches, leaves, flowers and fruits are beautiful and solemn, and the top of the tree is full of wishful wishes.

Eight snow lions hold the great throne, lotus flowers, sun and moon form the mattress,

Possessing the root guru of the three kindnesses, all Buddhas are the essence.

99

Now the monks are dressed in cassocks, with a smile on one side and two arms,

The right hand speaks, the left hand seals the seal, the bowl is filled with nectar,

He was dressed in three garments of tulip, with a golden hat on top.

The heart is capable of Rinjing Vajra holding the king, one face and two arms are blue,

Holding a bell and pestle, embracing the princess of the realm, benefiting from the innate wisdom of music and emptiness,

All kinds of treasures are regarded as decorations, and the variegated clothes are very strict.

Xianghao is solemn and bright, surrounded by five-colored clouds.

Foot-knotted Vajra squat posture, the five aggregates are pure, they are the five Buddhas,

The purity of the four worlds is the four bright concubines, all the bodhisattvas in all places,

Twenty-one thousand Arhats with pores, all branches and branches are King Ming,

The light is the secret trace of the fork that protects the prescription and the medicine, and all the people in the world are the foot pads.

Zhou Za personally shuns all teachers and teachers, all the gods in the altar of the deity,

All Buddhas, Bodhisattvas, warriors, dakas, surrounded by a sea of ​​Dharma protectors.

Each of the three gates and three vajra images, the hum character shines like a hook,

From the nature, please invite the wise deity, and the harmony will be stable and stable.

May all sentient beings be the great dependents, destroy the demon army and their retinues, and know that everything is complete. The World Honored One, please come here.

Then, visualize inviting Buddhas and Bodhisattvas, warriors, dakinis, and Dharma protectors from the Pure Land, and fuse them into the bodies of the deities visualized, and then recite the Fusion Mantra:

Zha () hum () bay () almost (), after integration, the Guru Three Jewels and the samaya (wisdom deity) that you visualize will be the same.

After viewing the grain fields, recite the Four Refugees.

There are four refuges in Sanskrit, Tibetan, and Chinese. Generally speaking, there are four refuges in Sanskrit.

Recite the Four Refugees.

While reciting, visualize the nectar water pouring down from the body of Sakyamuni Buddha. From the outside to the inside, the whole body and mind are washed clean by the nectar water, the karma turns into black water, the sickness turns into pus and blood, and the devil turns into a snake. , frogs and other small animals are flushed out of the pores of the body by the nectar water, and all diseases and demons are excreted from the body.

It is the most extraordinary to contemplate while reciting. You can also visualize first and then recite, or you can recite first and then visualize.

After reciting the Four Refugees, visualize the masters merging into Shakyamuni's body, and the bodhisattvas, Arahants and other monks also merge into Shakyamuni's body along with their teachings.

Then, the Buddha on the head becomes smaller and smaller. From the top of the head along the red central vein in the middle of the body, it goes all the way down into the heart. Visualize that your heart has become an eight-petal lotus. The Buddha sits in the eight-petal lotus, and the eight-petal lotus is gathered , Guru, Buddha, and one's own mind are indistinguishable.

The Buddha lives forever in the heart, that is, the Buddha in the heart, and taking refuge in the Buddha in the heart is the Three Jewels of the Guru.

There are different kinds of refuge states. This is the simplest one. Those with strong visualization ability can visualize a wider refuge state.

101

While practicing the Four Refugees, you should recite Om () Ah () Hung () more often to make offerings to all Buddhas and Bodhisattvas.

After reciting it three times, make offerings to the guru's Three Jewels. Om A Hung is the seed mantra of the body, speech, and mind of all Buddhas and Tathagatas. When reciting the first time, all the unclean things are purified. When reciting the second time, all the offerings become nectar. On the third time, the offerings become countless, and then make offerings to the Buddha in the heart.

This is relatively easy to do. In life, we can use our eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, and mind to make offerings to the Buddha in our hearts. The eyes see good things, the ears hear good sounds, the nose smells good smells, The tongue tastes good taste, etc., all can be offered to the Guru Triple Jewel in the heart.

Eating a meal can also make offerings to the Three Jewels, and when taking a bath, you can visualize the Buddha in your heart bathing, all of which can increase the blessings.

Section 5 The merits of taking refuge

1. Really enter Buddhism
Only after taking refuge can you be a Buddhist, a disciple of the Three Jewels, and truly enter Buddhism.

That is to say, from the moment of taking refuge in the Three Jewels, it is possible to begin to receive the blessings of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas.

102

The blessings of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas originally illuminated the earth like the sun, but before taking refuge, the mind was like hiding in a hole, and the sunshine of the blessings of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas could not shine.

2. The foundation and merits of being able to obtain good precepts
The root of the precepts is to take refuge, and only after taking refuge can one receive the precepts.

If there is only the idea of ​​taking refuge, but there is no refuge, then even the relatively basic five precepts cannot be upheld, much less the merits of taking precepts.

The foundation of the precept of liberation is also taking refuge. If there is no refuge, the merits and virtues of precepts of no liberation, bodhisattva, and tantric vows cannot arise.

3. The merits of eliminating karma
After taking refuge, the karma will be reduced every day.

After taking refuge, you will become a Buddhist disciple. You will continue to receive the blessings of the Three Jewels of the Guru, and the blessings of Buddhas, Bodhisattvas and Dharma Protectors. You will continue to eliminate karmic obstacles. Even if you recite the Buddha’s name of Shakyamuni once, you can eliminate tens of thousands of kalpas. Karma.

103

4. Produce infinite blessings
After taking refuge in the Three Jewels, the merits and virtues of taking refuge in the Three Jewels are inconceivable, the blessings obtained are also inconceivable, and there will be immeasurable blessings.

In the Treatise on Receiving Paramita it says:

Taking refuge in blessings has color, and the three realms are still narrow.

That is to say, if the merit obtained after taking refuge has a shape, then the space of the three realms cannot be accommodated. The three realms refer to the desire realm, the form realm, and the formless realm.

From this we can see how great the merit is after taking refuge.

The Buddha is the most extraordinary field of blessing. The root of goodness planted with the Buddha as the object, even if the original intention and motivation are not pure, will become the cause of liberation and becoming a Buddha.

The Buddha said in the Great Compassion White Lotus Sutra:

Ananda! As for the good roots born of the Buddha, they will attain the fruit of Nirvana even if they do not want them. I say that they will eventually attain Nirvana.

In this way, the Buddha, World-Honored One, is born with a single thought, and the fruit of all their good roots is Nirvana, and I say that they will eventually attain Nirvana.

Here the Buddha said to Venerable Ananda that the roots of goodness planted by the Buddha, even if they did not initially attain the fruit of nirvana, will surely eventually become nirvana.

Therefore, after taking refuge, when making offerings to Buddhas and Bodhisattvas, or after reciting scriptures and practicing the Dharma, when devotion is made, the devotion goes to a place where it is not good and not the ultimate.

104

For example, in the past, there were people in India who made offerings to thousands of monks, but they didn’t know how to return after making offerings.

At this time, he saw a beautiful elephant in front of him. In India at that time, elephants were very respected animals. He thought, I will go back and become an elephant in the next life.

As a result, after his death, because of the great blessings he offered to thousands of monks, he became the mount of Emperor Shitian, a three-headed incense elephant.

This is an example of the wrong devotion, but, even so, the blessing will eventually return to liberate him to become a Buddha.

Our usual return is:

Dedication of merit to the six realms, sentient beings free from suffering and attain happiness

This is a very good devotion. Dedicating to all sentient beings in the six realms to get rid of suffering and achieve happiness, including both family members and ourselves, is very extraordinary.

Don't be afraid if the devotion is wrong, even if the blessing will turn to the wrong place, after taking refuge, because of the merit of taking refuge, the blessing will still return to the ultimate vow of becoming a Buddha and liberation.

5. Do not fall into the evil path
Taking refuge with sincerity will naturally eliminate the karma of falling into the three evil realms.

If you don’t do bad things after taking refuge, you will definitely be reborn in the Pure Land or get the fruit of human and heaven with the blessing of the Guru’s Three Jewels.

105

6. Not disturbed by demons
After taking refuge, you will not be hindered by ghosts and demons.

If you think about the four refuges, they will run away, and the merits of the four refuges are very extraordinary.

Among the Four Refugees, one sentence of taking refuge in the guru means taking refuge in the lineage guru of all dynasties, starting with Buddha Shakyamuni, up to one's own root guru.

For example, in our lineage, from Buddha Shakyamuni to the present, there are a total of forty-six generations. One sentence of taking refuge in the guru means taking refuge in forty-six teachers including Buddha Shakyamuni. Including many Buddhas and Bodhisattvas.

Taking refuge in a Buddha does not mean taking refuge in one or two Buddhas, but taking refuge in all the Buddhas in the ten directions and three times, including a certain Buddha who has a deep relationship with ourselves.

Taking refuge in the Dharma means taking refuge in 84,000 dharmas, including all the teachings and dharmas handed down by Buddha Shakyamuni.

Taking refuge as a monk means taking refuge in all the bodhisattvas and arahants from one place to ten places, as well as the transcendent Dharma protectors, which naturally include the bodhisattvas and Dharma protectors who have a special predestined relationship with us.

As soon as we recite the Four Refugees, the Three Jewels will come to rescue us. Those Buddhas, Bodhisattvas and Dharma protectors who are related to us will come in an instant because of their karma.

So, after taking refuge, you will be protected by all these gurus, Buddhas, Bodhisattvas, and Dharma protectors, and you will not suffer any harm.

Seven, wish
Doing things is easy to succeed, and any wish will be easy to achieve.

After taking refuge, if you always sincerely respect the Three Jewels and ask for their blessings, you can easily succeed in doing things.

Although the degree of confidence is different, the blessings produced are also different, but the blessings will gradually increase, and doing things will become easier and easier, so the biggest way to accumulate blessings is to recite the four refuges.

The Buddha said in the Great Game Sutra:

Blessed people do everything.

The previous life of Venerable Milarepa, the Kadampa Dade Yogi Chachi also said: If you have a normal heart of taking refuge, you will first be rewarded in this life, and everything will be accomplished, and then at the end of your life, you will obtain auspicious blessings. sign.

8. Quick Achievements
107

Before taking refuge, all aspects of practice are much worse than after taking refuge.

If nothing else, there are the same differences between heaven and earth in terms of accumulating resources and eliminating karma.

Therefore, after taking refuge, the achievement of studies will be faster.

To take refuge in the Buddha, one must respect the Buddha, not to take refuge in evil demons, but not to exclude them; to take refuge in the Dharma, one must respect the Dharma and not harm sentient beings; to take refuge in the Sangha, one must respect the Sangha, not make evil friends, but rely on and be close to the guru.

You should also try your best to study, think, and cultivate, make offerings to the Three Jewels as much as possible, create more good karma, and guide those who have karma to convert to Buddhism.

108

Chapter Seven Sending Bodhicitta

All Buddhas, Wonderful Dharma, Zhongzun and even Bodhi, I take refuge

I give all kinds of resources to save sentient beings and wish to become a Buddha

All Buddhas and Wonderful Dharma Congregation Reverend: All Buddhas are all Buddhas of the ten directions and three times.

The wonderful Dharma is eighty-four thousand Dharma doors.

The Zhongzuns are the Sangha, including Bodhisattvas, Arahants, and Dharma protectors.

Zhongzun: The most honorable among all beings is the Sangha.

The group refers to the four groups of disciples: bhikkhus, nuns, upasakas, and upasikas.

Sangha is also called Sangha in a broad sense. Sangha includes Bodhisattvas, Arahants, and Dharma protectors.

If it is a monk who has realized emptiness, or a monk with bodhicitta, it is also a sangha.

The same is true of lay people. If a lay family has Bodhicitta, he is a sangha. The sangha does not only refer to monks.

If it is an ordinary monk, at least four monks can represent a monk.

109

Even Bodhi I take refuge: It means taking refuge until attaining Buddhahood.

Taking refuge in the guru, taking refuge in the Buddha, taking refuge in the Dharma, and taking refuge in the Sangha are the separate refuges of the Three Jewels, and this refers to the refuge of the Three Jewels together.

I perform all kinds of resources such as charity: our current behavior is the behavior of the bodhisattva, the behavior of the bodhisattva.

There are many behaviors of bodhisattvas. Generally speaking, they are the six perfections, which are the six perfections of generosity, precepts, patience, diligence, meditation, and wisdom paramita.

Accumulations are blessings, the blessings of taking refuge in the Three Jewels, the blessings of giving, the blessings of diligence, the blessings of prajna wisdom, and the blessings of practicing meditation, etc., use these blessings and resources to become Buddhas and save sentient beings .

I wish to become a Buddha in order to save all sentient beings: I will become a Buddha myself in order to save all sentient beings.

This is the heart of generating Bodhicitta and becoming a Buddha.

Just recite it three times, and generate bodhicitta three times. Because the mind is very good, the power of reciting any sutras and mantras will be very powerful!

There are three important points in practice: initiation, visualization, and dedication.

The practice goes through three stages: the beginning, the middle and the last: it is very important to have the intention at the beginning, the visualization during the practice is very important, and the dedication after the practice is very important.

110

Section 1 Bodhicitta
What is true bodhicitta? Bodhicitta is the mind of a bodhisattva, and one who has attained bodhicitta is a bodhisattva.

The real Bodhisattva is called Bodhisattva. Bodhisattva is a literal translation of Sanskrit. Bodhi means to realize, to break, to fully realize emptiness, to completely eliminate the obstacles of afflictions and knowledge, and to save sentient beings is very brave.

Simply put, Bodhicitta is the heart of becoming a Buddha. In order to save all sentient beings, I want to become a Buddha, which is Bodhicitta.

Bodhicitta must have at least two conditions, first, the goal is to become a Buddha; second, to save the six realms and become a Buddha.

Bodhicitta is divided into vow bodhicitta and action bodhichitta.

In order to save sentient beings, making a vow to achieve great bodhi is called vow bodhicitta; on the basis of making a vow, practicing six degrees of ten thousand deeds to realize this vow is called practice bodhicitta.

Bodhicitta is further divided into twenty-two levels. The lowest level is called earth bodhicitta. We see that the earth sometimes changes, and the same is true for earth bodhicitta, which sometimes regresses.

The second level of bodhicitta is called golden bodhicitta.

We know that the nature of gold is very stable. No matter whether it is burned by fire or cut with a knife, the nature of gold will not change. Therefore, starting from the golden bodhicitta, the bodhicitta will not regress.

We now feel that sometimes we have bodhicitta, and sometimes we do not, because we have not yet attained true bodhichitta.

111

The present bodhicitta is false bodhicitta, also known as artificial bodhichitta.

Bodhicitta and emptiness are the essence of eighty-four thousand teachings, and these two are the most important of all.

However, only the wisdom of emptiness can only liberate, but cannot become a Buddha. The dual cultivation of wisdom of emptiness and bodhicitta can not only liberate, but also become a Buddha.

Section 2 How to Generate Bodhicitta
Bodhicitta is the heart that oneself want to become a Buddha for the sake of the six realms of sentient beings who are free from suffering and obtain happiness.

From the moment of attaining bodhicitta, practitioners have truly entered the door of Mahayana Buddhism.

How to generate bodhicitta? There are two ways to generate bodhicitta, seven-factor karma and self-exchange. Let's talk about the seven-factor karma first.

1. The Seven Branches of Karma Generate Bodhicitta
Bodhicitta is generated through seven steps to generate bodhicitta, so it is called seven.

Except for the first step, each step has a causal relationship with the previous steps, so it is called Bodhicitta.

112

1. Recognize that all living beings in the six realms are their own mothers
Before cultivating the Bodhicitta of the Seven Branches of Karma, one must cultivate the mind of equality.

What is equanimity, that is, whether it is to look at the enemy or relatives and friends, there must be an equanimity, and there should be no greed or hatred.

Without equality, everything is done for the sake of relatives and friends, and it is impossible to save sentient beings in the six realms, because the sentient beings in the six realms include their own enemies, grievances and creditors.

After you have a mind of equality, you can cultivate the bodhicitta of the seven branches of cause and effect. First of all, you must recognize that all sentient beings in the six realms are mothers.

How to identify it? We have been reincarnated countless times in reincarnation, and the number of reincarnations is more than the sand in the universe. Every reincarnation has a mother. Therefore, all beings in the six realms have been our mothers when we were reincarnated.

And not only have they been once or twice, but sentient beings in the six realms have been our parents countless times, even if they are not mothers in this life, they are also mothers in past lives.

The most basic of the bodhisattva way is to recognize that all beings in the six realms are mothers, which is the foundation of bodhicitta.

113

2. I miss my mother
Since it is a mother, how much kindness is my biological mother to us, and sentient beings in the six realms also have the same kindness to us.

3. Repay mother's kindness
After thinking about my mother's kindness, I think about how to repay my mother's kindness.

The best way to repay the mother's kindness is to guide all sentient beings like a mother into Buddhism and let her practice the Dharma. In this way, at least later generations will not fall into the evil realm.

4. Show mercy
What we often recite, "May all sentient beings be blessed with happiness and the cause of happiness," is the act of loving kindness.

To all sentient beings, express the kindness of a mother to her son, and may all sentient beings always have happiness and the cause of happiness.

5. Sympathy
"May all sentient beings be free from suffering and the causes of suffering", which is to express compassion.

All sentient beings in the six realms have great suffering. The causes of these sufferings are afflictions and karma. We must think in our hearts that every sentient being can be free from suffering and the causes of suffering forever. This is to show compassion.

114

6. Increase the sense of responsibility
Think about it: I am a child of sentient beings in the six realms, and I have the responsibility to guide all sentient beings like a mother to get rid of suffering and achieve happiness, and I must express this sense of responsibility.

Think again: Do I have the ability to help all sentient beings like mothers get rid of suffering and achieve happiness? No.

There is no ability to help one's own mother get rid of suffering and happiness, let alone the ability to help sentient beings in the six realms who are like mothers.

7. Generate Bodhicitta
Who has the ability to free living beings in the six realms from suffering and attain happiness? Arahant? Dengdi Bodhisattva? None of them have this ability, only Buddha has this ability.

Therefore, I want to make up my mind: In order for sentient beings in the six realms to be free from suffering and achieve happiness, I want to become a Buddha. After becoming a Buddha, I will immediately save sentient beings like mothers, so that sentient beings can be free from suffering and achieve happiness.

This is the Bodhicitta arising from the seven branches of cause and effect.

2. To exchange bodhicitta from others
115

The exchange of bodhicitta from others is not an exchange of oneself with others, but the exchange of one's self-interest of loving me and respecting me to an altruistic heart of loving and respecting him.

Use this kind of altruism to replace your own self-interest, and then increase your sense of responsibility. The bodhicitta that arises at this time is the bodhicitta that is exchanged for others.

The Treatise on Entering Bodhisattva Actions states:

If there is a desire to be hasty, the rescue should come to him, he should be replaced by him, and the secret should be performed.

Compared with the seven-branch karma to generate bodhicitta, it is faster and more courageous to cultivate bodhicitta by exchanging it with others, and there are many extraordinary merits.

To exchange bodhicitta from others, we must first know the harm of self-interest.

In the Treatise on Entering Bodhisattva Actions, it says:

All the joys in the world are born from the benefit of others, and all the sufferings in the world are from self-interest.

All beings are poisoned by swords and soldiers, obstructed and violated by heavenly dragons and evil ghosts, and even being born in hells, hungry ghosts, animal realms, etc., all of which stem from doing evil karma such as killing for their own benefit.

In our daily life, all kinds of ailments, conflicts and troubles in our bodies, failures at work, being excluded, and even suffering from lawsuits and violating national laws, also stem from self-interest.

116

Why does everyone naturally respect Buddhas and Bodhisattvas? It is also because Buddhas and Bodhisattvas love and respect all beings.

The Buddhist scriptures say: what kind of karma is done, what kind of fruit is produced.

Respecting others will also be respected and loved by others. This is a causal relationship.

At the same time, it can also be explained: the number of sentient beings that can be loved and respected, the more sentient beings will be loved and respected.

If we can love people all over the world, people in the whole world will love us; if we can love all beings in the six realms, all living beings in the six realms will love us; if we can love those ghosts, demons, and debtors, they will not harm us.

When ghosts and demons who live by harming people encounter bodhisattvas, they not only do not harm them, but also make offerings to them. The reason is very simple. They are also one of the sentient beings. Bodhisattvas have compassion for them, love them, and will not harm them. can also feel it.

When Venerable Atisha first came to Tibet, many people came to greet him.

Everyone saw Venerable Atisha, and saw Venerable clasping his hands all the time, bowing his head humbly.

Everyone said: Ah, the masters respect us.

Because Venerable Atisha respected everyone, everyone liked him after Venerable Atisha went to Tibet.

When cultivating the bodhicitta of self-exchange exchange, one must first cultivate the first five parts of the bodhicitta of the seven branches of cause and effect.

Practice self-exchange in the way of visualization, visualize using various altruistic hearts to replace self-interested hearts that love me and respect me, and then increase the sense of responsibility, and then develop the bodhicitta.

117

When visualizing, there are many aspects to be exchanged: one’s own happiness is exchanged for others’ pain, one’s health is exchanged for others’ sickness, one’s ability is exchanged for others’ powerlessness, one’s wisdom is exchanged for others’ ignorance, one’s own blessings are exchanged. Retribution is exchanged with others' karma, one's own merits are exchanged with others' faults, and one's great happiness is exchanged with others' troubles.

When meditating, visualize the above-mentioned happiness, wisdom, blessings, etc., which will become immeasurable white light, emanating from your right nostril and entering the left nostril of beings in the six realms. Happy, good news.

Then visualize the karma and afflictions of living beings in the six realms mentioned above, all turning into black air, flowing out from the right nostril of living beings in the six realms, inhaling it through your left nostril, and visualizing hitting your ego and breaking it. I do.

This is the meditation method of exchanging bodhicitta with others.

If you often meditate in this way, you will feel that you have accepted the karma and illness of others.

After accepting this, the body will get sick, but because of the power of bodhicitta, this sickness will eventually be eliminated.

In the past, very few people in Tibet had serious illnesses such as cancer. It was because there were many masters with relatively great achievements who often practiced self-exchange bodhicitta, exchanged the illnesses of sentient beings, and prevented many people from getting cancer.

118

There was once a tumor disease in Tibetan areas, that is, tumors on the neck, especially in Guide County, Qinghai, this disease is common.

Later, Guide produced a great siddhi master Taxiu. He often exchanged bodhicitta from him and sucked the tumors of all living beings. Finally, a large tumor grew on his neck. Since then, there will be no more there. This disease has occurred.

After Master Taxiu practiced for a few more years, his illness gradually recovered.

This is the power of exchanging bodhichitta with others.

Geshe Chekhwa, a disciple of the Kadampa Master Shayrawa, is known as the Dharma King of Leprosy in Tibet.

There was no way to cure leprosy before. Geshe Che Kawa treated the newly arrived leprosy patients with the method he exchanged.

Chekava also taught these lepers to practice the Three Ways and exchange bodhicitta with them.

Everyone thinks that this master's teaching is to cure leprosy, but in fact, Geshe Che Kawa taught them the three ways, especially the bodhicitta of self-exchange in the three ways.

After the lepers recovered, they continued to practice self-exchange bodhicitta, and in the end, most of them achieved it.

119

The third section of Bodhicitta's merits
Without bodhicitta, good fortune will not become the cause of Buddhahood.

Even if all the blessings become the cause of the worldly Dharma, it will not become the cause of Buddhahood.

With bodhicitta, all the blessings can be turned into the cause of Buddhahood.

Not only will it become the cause of Buddhahood, but the blessings will continue to grow.

When people are not angry, their blessings will triple every day.

After attaining bodhicitta, the fortune will increase tenfold, ten thousand times, ten thousand times ten thousand times.

Moreover, after attaining bodhicitta, new blessings will be accumulated, day and night will accumulate blessings, even sleeping will accumulate blessings. This is the merit of bodhicitta.

With bodhicitta, karma will also be eliminated.

The big karma that is difficult to eliminate will be eliminated immediately after generating bodhicitta.

With bodhicitta, one will naturally receive the blessings of the Buddhas and Tathagatas.

Before you have no bodhicitta, you need to rely on your guru to get the true blessings of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas. So you have to take refuge in your guru. After you have bodhicitta, you can get the blessings of all Buddhas and Tathagatas.

With Bodhicitta, the eight great dragon kings, the eight gods of heaven, the gods of the earth, and so on, will all come to protect them.

It will help break down obstacles and make wishes come true.

With Bodhicitta, the transcendent Dharma protector will follow and protect him like a shadow.

After having bodhicitta, the people around will naturally become better, their troubles will naturally be suppressed by the power of bodhicitta, they will not be angry, and everyone will become very harmonious.

After having Bodhicitta, recite the sentence "Om Mani Pami Hum", the merit will become as big as the sky, and it will never disappear.

Before we attain Bodhicitta, after reciting a sentence, once the blessings we get are manifested, they are gone.

With Bodhicitta, the merits of reciting "Om Mani Pami Hum" will increase every day, a million times, so even if this kind of good retribution appears every day, it will not be used up.

There are many virtues of bodhicitta.

In the Tibetan version of the Huayan Sutra, there are 263 qualities of bodhichitta.

Section 4: The Way of Contemplation and Cultivation of Bodhicitta When developing bodhicitta, how should we visualize and practice?

Visualize that Shakyamuni Buddha is in the middle, and around Shakyamuni Buddha are the Guru Three Jewels.

Including the root guru and the lineage guru, around the guru is the deity of Shibu, around the deity of Shibu are all the Buddhas and Tathagatas, around the Buddhas are all the Bodhisattvas, around the Bodhisattva, visualize the Arahants, and visualize the surroundings of the Arahants. The Dharma Protector, the Four Heavenly Kings are visualized around the Dharma Protector, these are the Buddhas and the Wonderful Dharma Congregation.

Even after Bodhi, I take refuge, I perform all kinds of merits, and I wish to become a Buddha in order to save sentient beings.

Thinking: In order to save sentient beings, I will take refuge in the Three Jewels of the Guru until I become a Buddha; I will also generate Bodhicitta, and may all the good deeds and roots that I do, cultivate the six degrees of virtue, etc., become the cause of Buddhahood, for the sake of all sentient beings Must become a Buddha.

After reciting it three times, visualize the bodies of all Buddhas and Tathagatas glowing white light, shining on all beings in the six realms, eliminating all karma and obstacles of all beings, and all beings have become Buddhas, dignified and good-looking.

To put it simply, just visualize in this way to cultivate bodhicitta. The content of bodhicitta is very deep and broad. For a detailed explanation, please refer to "The Treasures of the Dharma Sea" IV.

Chapter 8 The Four Infinite Hearts
May all sentient beings be blessed with happiness and the cause of happiness (love)

May all sentient beings be free from suffering and its causes (compassion)

May all sentient beings never be separated from the wonderful happiness without suffering

May all sentient beings stay away from love, hatred, closeness, and equanimity

To develop the four immeasurable hearts is to develop loving-kindness, compassion, joy, and equanimity for infinite sentient beings.

Cultivating the four immeasurable minds can accumulate immeasurable blessings and eliminate immeasurable karma.

Section 1 May all sentient beings be blessed with happiness and the cause of happiness

The first of the four immeasurable heart texts is: May all sentient beings be blessed with happiness and the causes of happiness, this is the radiating loving-kindness.

123

All sentient beings are living beings in the six realms.

May all sentient beings be filled with happiness and the causes of happiness.

Well-being means peace, joy, and happiness.

It means having a place to live, something to eat, and clothes to wear, that means life and family peace, wisdom, blessings, and good health.

What is the cause of peace? First of all, it is to do the ten good deeds. If you don’t kill, don’t steal, don’t commit adultery, don’t lie, don’t provoke alienation, don’t speak ill of words, don’t gossip, don’t greed, don’t hold anger, and don’t hold wrong views, then you will be happy. the cause.

Second, our practice is all about the cause of happiness.

Reciting sutras and mantras is the cause of happiness, cultivating precepts, concentration and wisdom is the cause of happiness, and all the six paramitas are the cause of happiness.

Moreover, practicing the accumulation of blessings is the cause of happiness in the next life. If you do not accumulate blessings in this life, you will not have happiness in the next life.

May all sentient beings be filled with happiness and the causes of happiness.

It is to hope that those who lack food and clothing can live without food, those who are sick can be healthy, those who are homeless can have a house to live in, and those who do not have a good family life, hope that their families will be harmonious. This is kindness and love. .

I also hope that sentient beings not only have happiness, but also the causes of happiness.

Because the happiness that is not sufficient is only a momentary happiness, it is not long-term. With the cause of happiness, the blessings appear, and happiness comes out.

124

1. The merits of merciful love
If you can truly generate loving-kindness, the merit will be enormous.

It is stated in the "Bao Ga Lun":

Every day at three o'clock, three hundred jars of food and drink, but it is not as long as a moment, and one cent of compassion is cultivated.

Heaven and man are all loving, they are always guarded, joy is much more comfortable, and poisonous swords cannot penetrate.

If you can accomplish nothing without labor, you will be born in the Brahman world, and if you cannot be liberated, you will obtain the eight virtues of loving-kindness.

This means that if someone gives three hundred jars of food and drink to sentient beings three times a day, the merit is certainly very great, but it is not as good as the merit of cultivating loving-kindness in an instant.

Cultivating kindness and love can also gain the blessings of God's protection, comfort and joy, avoiding the poison of swords and soldiers, doing things without hard work, and reincarnating Brahma in later generations.

Even if you are not freed in this life, you will get the benefits of the eight great virtues of loving kindness.

1. All beings will be happy.
People who often show loving kindness always have a loving smile on their faces, and everyone will like it when they see it.

Because of the warmth on him, everyone can feel it.

125

When Dharma King Yongzeng was alive, everyone was very happy to see him, even Muslims, because of his loving kindness.

No matter where Dharma King Yeshe Gyatso goes, no matter what religion or ethnicity he encounters, everyone likes him very much and welcomes him. It is also because of the Master's benevolence and merit.

2. The heart will be very peaceful and happy
When Dharma King Yeshe Gyatso was teaching the scriptures, he often said: I don't have any special merit. I put my head on the pillow and fell asleep. This is my merit.

This shows that he has compassion.

People who do not have loving-kindness do not sleep so easily, or even sleep, and are always restless and worried.

3. Swordsmen and Poisonous Demons can't do any harm
When Buddha Shakyamuni was about to become a Buddha, many emperors and demons came to hinder him.

The Son of Heaven Demon tempted the Buddha and said: Stop practicing, Devadatta is going to be a king, and he will harm all beings.

Buddha Shakyamuni ignored them, and they gave many reasons, such as your parents being ill, and so on.

But the Buddha is motionless, always resting in loving-kindness concentration.

126

The Son of Heaven Demon turned into a lot of beautiful women, but he still couldn't disturb the Buddha.

In the end, the Son of Heaven Demon had no choice, so he turned out a lot of knives and spears to slash Shakyamuni Buddha.

At this time, the Buddha sent out loving-kindness, and the sword and spear turned into lotus flowers. This is the energy of loving-kindness.

In the past, someone poisoned Master Jiamu-like Xieba of Labrang Monastery. After the poisoning, the master felt a little uncomfortable.

At this time, a master from the Amdo area said to Jiamu Sanxieba: If you truly cultivate loving-kindness, you will be able to expel the poison.

If you can't detox, I'll blow up the Potala Palace.

Master Jiamu-like Xieba said: This is not necessary.

After he finished speaking, he expelled the poison along his fingers.

Great loving-kindness will turn poison into nectar; moderate loving-kindness will expel the poison.

The merits of loving-kindness are extremely great, and swords, guns and weapons cannot harm those who have loving-kindness.

Shanpa Rinpoche in India was very accomplished and had great compassion. The birds in the air were very happy when they saw him, and they all came down and flew around him three times before walking around. The same was true for tigers and lions when they saw him.

Once, there was a war, and both sides of the war were hacking and killing each other. Shanpa Rinpoche happened to pass by this place. When everyone saw him, they put down their swords and guns, and no longer wanted to kill.

4. Everything goes well without effort
127

People with loving-kindness will get the help of human beings and all beings. They don't need to work hard, and they will naturally have their wishes.

5. Feel free to be reborn in another Pure Land
After the person who has received loving-kindness dies, he can be reborn in another Pure Land at will.

If they want to be reborn in the Western Pure Land, ordinary people may not be able to guarantee rebirth by reciting Amitabha Buddha, but after receiving loving kindness, they can definitely be reborn in the Western Paradise of Ultimate Bliss.

2. How to show mercy
To practice loving-kindness, one must first extend loving-kindness to one's own mother.

To develop loving-kindness towards the mother is not to crave the mother, but to have true love.

First visualize your biological mother in front of you, and then think: The person in front of you is not only my mother in this life, but has been my mother many times in life, and her kindness to me is as vast as the void.

Thinking of mother's kindness in this way will naturally give birth to the heart of loving mother, which is the heart of true love.

Compassion is to give happiness, to give happiness to all beings.

So, think again, did your mother get Anle and Anleine?

128

Well-being is a peaceful and happy life.

If the mother can't be happy because she doesn't have a house, have we ever thought about giving her a house? If your mother is ill, have you ever thought of letting her get good medicine and medicine and recover as soon as possible? If you have the idea of ​​wanting your mother to gain peace and tranquility, you will develop loving-kindness towards your mother.

After being able to develop loving-kindness toward one's own mother, one can then show loving-kindness toward those around them, relatives and friends, and then toward those who are unfriendly to oneself and enemies.

If it can be sent out, then I will show mercy to all people on the four continents.

After being able to generate loving-kindness in human beings, send loving-kindness to all beings in the heavenly realm and to asuras.

If you can develop loving-kindness, then you will show loving-kindness to all beings in the animal realm, the hungry ghost realm, and the hell realm in turn.

In this way, one should develop loving-kindness towards all beings in the six realms.

Or start with your own children: If my child does not have a house, may he have a house to live in; if he does not succeed, may he succeed; if he does not develop wisdom, may he develop wisdom; if he does not become rich, may he become rich.

If you can express it to your children, it is an achievement.

If you can't show it to your children, show love to your parents.

If you can't tell your parents, just think about who the closest person is, show kindness and love to that person, and you will succeed if you send it out.

129

After it is issued, we must persist in not turning back, and we must keep getting better and better. On this basis, we will show mercy to other relatives and friends, to ordinary people, and to our enemies, relatives and creditors. Sending loving-kindness, and finally sending loving-kindness to sentient beings in the six realms.

To test whether there is loving kindness, the main thing is to see whether there is jealousy.

Jealousy means that loving-kindness is not enough; when loving-kindness is truly expressed, there will be no jealousy at all.

If you are often jealous of others, try to blame yourself: I have no loving-kindness, and I should not be jealous of others.

In this way, the mentality will gradually change.

When we cultivate loving-kindness, we can also use the method of visualization to cultivate.

First of all, make your mind: May all sentient beings be blessed with happiness and the causes of happiness.

Then, visualize your body becoming a wish-fulfilling jewel, and innumerable wish-fulfilling jewels appear in the wish-fulfilling jewel, and then visualize giving the wish-fulfilling jewel to every sentient being. Whatever sentient beings want, the wish-fulfilling jewel will manifest at will.

Through this kind of visualization, all sentient beings in the six realms can gain happiness and the cause of happiness.

The virtues of loving kindness are boundless.

If a person can show kindness to all the people in the world, in this life, all the people will like him, and in the next life, he can be the king who rules this world.

According to karma, it is not so easy to be a king. Most of them are people who have shown kindness to many sentient beings in their previous lives.

If you often show loving-kindness, especially for your opponent, this person will definitely turn around, the relationship will be improved and improved, and the other party will also be better for you. This is the influence of loving-kindness energy.

Verse 2 May all sentient beings be free from suffering and its causes
The second of the four immeasurable heart texts is: May all sentient beings be free from suffering and its causes.

Suffering is suffering, including the suffering of all sentient beings in the six realms, especially the suffering of the three evil realms.

The sufferings of human beings include the suffering of birth, old age, sickness and death, the suffering of not being able to seek, the suffering of parting from love, the suffering of resentment and hatred, and the suffering of grasping the five aggregates.

Defilements are defilements, including the six root defilements, the twenty subordinate defilements, and many other defilements.

Pain and trouble are called distress.

Sentient beings have many sufferings and afflictions, and they wish to be free from suffering and the causes of suffering and afflictions.

The cause of suffering is the creation of ten evil karmas: killing, stealing, sexual misconduct, lying, etc., as well as karmic obstacles such as breaking precepts.

There are also many causes of afflictions, such as random thoughts, etc., are all causes of afflictions, and the fundamental causes of afflictions are the three poisons of greed, hatred, ignorance and ignorance.

Here, I hope that sentient beings will be free from suffering and the causes of suffering. This kind of motivation is the great compassion.

Compassion is the relief of suffering, and compassion is great compassion. The seven causal factors of the Mahayana originate in the heart of Bodhi. The most precious thing is compassion. With compassion, the ability to save sentient beings will become very great.

1. The Importance of Great Compassion
Showing compassion is very important.

First of all, having compassion is one of the important differences between Buddhism and paganism.

Second, compassion is also the foundation of Mahayana Buddhist practice.

Master Tsongkhapa specifically pointed out in the section on the stage of cultivation of bodhicitta in "The Broad Treatise on the Stages of the Bodhi Path": "The root of the Mahayana path is great compassion", and "The rest of the cause and effect are the truth of this cause and effect".

It means that all the fruits of Mahayana Buddhism all come from compassion.

The "Zhengshe Dharma Sutra" also says: "World Honored One, it is like the place where the wheel-turning holy king's wheel treasure arrives, and all the armies arrive there.

World Honored One, wherever the great compassion of the Bodhisattva comes, all the Dharma comes to him.

"The wheel treasure of the wheel-turning holy king is used to transport the army. The meaning of this sutra is to say: Just like the place where the wheel-turning holy king's wheel treasure is, all the troops will go there, so Buddha and Bodhisattva preaching scriptures and teachings are also driven by compassion. Wherever the great compassion of the Bodhisattva is born, all the Buddhadharma will be propagated in that place.

In the "Treatise on Entering the Middle" written by Yuecheng Bodhisattva, the first verse of the opening stanza says:

132

In the voice-hearer, the Buddha can be reborn as a king, and all the Buddhas are reborn from the Bodhisattva.

Great compassion and incomparable wisdom, Bodhicitta is the cause of the son of Buddha.

It means that the Shravaka and the Arhats were born because of the teachings of the Buddha, and the Buddha was born from the cultivation of the Bodhisattva.

The Bodhisattva was originally born by cultivating great compassion, and then practising emptiness wisdom and bodhicitta, which shows the importance of great compassion.

Therefore, in order to become a Buddha, the first and foremost thing is to cultivate great compassion.

The second verse that follows immediately says:

Compassion is the great fruit of the Buddha, like a seed growing like water at first.

If you can use it all the time, if it is mature, I will first praise the great compassion.

That is to say, in order to obtain such a vast blessing as a Buddha, when a bodhisattva first develops his mind, he needs to have a great compassion in order to generate the seeds of bodhicitta, because bodhicitta is the cause of bodhisattva, and great compassion is the cause of bodhichitta; At that time, there must be the nourishment of the water of great compassion, so that the seeds of bodhicitta will not wither, and will grow day by day; when the bodhisattva becomes a Buddha in the later period, the great compassion should be manifested in the retribution body or incarnation to teach and transform all living beings, so that all living beings can obtain real benefits.

If you do not have great compassion, you will be unwilling to help sentient beings to liberate, and you will be like an arahant who has entered Nirvana by yourself, and sentient beings will not be helped.

133

Therefore, for attaining Buddhahood, compassion is always the most important in every moment of the first, middle, and last three periods of practice.

It is also stated in the "Jing Zhuang Lun":

If there is no root of compassion, one cannot endure the suffering of practice, and if one cannot bear the suffering, no benefit will arise.

If you don't have the thought of benefiting living beings, you will not make a vow to turn your body.

What does that mean? That is to say: If a practitioner does not have compassion as the foundation, he will not be able to endure the suffering of cultivation; if he cannot endure suffering, he will not be able to achieve the cause of benefiting all beings; Transform all beings.

Therefore, only with compassion and compassion can one endure all kinds of suffering in practice, and finally be able to become a Buddha and save sentient beings in the six realms.

The size of bodhicitta depends on the size of compassion.

The speed at which Bodhisattvas cultivate and become Buddhas is also determined by the size of their compassion.

Some bodhisattvas practice tantric practices and become Buddhas quickly, also because of the power of compassion.

Why don't Theravada Arhats save sentient beings? It is because the compassion is not enough, as long as you are happy, you can enter into concentration,

134

Into blissful meditation.

Compassion is the most important method of Mahayana Buddhism. With compassion, the power to save sentient beings will be great, and it will definitely save sentient beings.

If there is a couple whose only child is seriously ill, they must have a strong sense of compassion for the child.

In this way, the greater the compassion, the greater the hope to save the child, the more ways to come up, and the greater the hope for the child to be saved.

The same is true for saving sentient beings in the six realms. With great compassion, one will surely rescue sentient beings in the six realms.

2. How to express compassion
Whether you can save sentient beings depends on how much compassion you can show.

Whether you can express compassion or not depends on your understanding of the suffering of sentient beings. If you have a deep and broad understanding of the suffering of sentient beings in the six realms, and have a very strong understanding, it is easy to express compassion.

Therefore, the root of cultivating compassion is to constantly think about the suffering of sentient beings.

Before thinking about the suffering of sentient beings, you must have a certain feeling for the suffering. First, you must often think about your own suffering.

For example, always think: My pain is so much, it would be great if I could be relieved! I can't bear so much pain, how can other beings bear it? Thinking like this, from your own pain to other sentient beings, you will gradually experience compassion and compassion.

Rethink the pain of the three evil realms.

Visualize the various sufferings beings in the evil realms are suffering: beings in the hell realm are scorched by a red-hot iron plate and boiled in boiling hot iron; beings in the hungry ghost realm are so hungry that their eyes are dimmed; and many more.

Then it can be extended to other sentient beings.

After generating compassion for the sentient beings in the three evil realms, combine the content of the truth of suffering and think about the sentient beings in the human and heavenly realms.

If you think about it, you will understand: the sentient beings in the human and heavenly ways seem to be living well, because of the great blessings and retribution.

In fact, it is no different from a lamb to be slaughtered. It is about to be killed without knowing it. It is just that the time of death is sequential, and sooner or later, it will fall into the evil realm. In fact, it is no different from having fallen into the evil realm.

After thinking about the suffering of the six realms, then cultivate compassion for the mother in this life.

My mother did a lot of bad karma because she didn't understand the Dharma, and she's still doing it.

Although we try our best to be nice to her, she still suffers from the three sufferings.

Think again, all beings in the six realms are our mothers, and they are all suffering and creating the causes of suffering.

Therefore, we should develop compassion, thinking about the suffering of all living beings, and at the same time making a vow: How good would it be if these mother beings could be freed from suffering and the causes of suffering! I must rescue these mother beings!

136

Compassion can be divided into two types, motherly compassion and fatherly compassion.

The compassion that only wishes to stay away from suffering is the compassion of the shravaka and the Arahants, and it can also be called the compassion of a mother.

And that kind of compassion that sees the suffering of all beings and has the courage to save all beings is the compassion of the Mahayana, also known as the father-like compassion, and it is also the compassion that we need to generate.

How to be sad? Think of it this way: First of all, I hope that my biological mother will stay away from distress and the causes of distress, and it is easier to show compassion for someone close to me for the first time.

After this thought arises, think about it again, and hope that relatives and friends who are closer to you will stay away from distress and the causes of distress.

Then send it out more widely, and send it to relatives who are a little more unfamiliar. After you can send it out, you can send it to ordinary people.

After being able to express your heart to ordinary people, you can then treat your own hair.

Don't set your mind on all your opponents at the same time, first think of a person who often opposes you, visualize, and hope that he will be free from suffering and the causes of suffering.

If you can't send it out, you have to send it again. After it is sent out, change the opponent and send compassion again.

In this way, gradually express compassion for all opponents, enemies, and all grievances and creditors, and finally to all sentient beings in the six realms.

137

By practicing compassion and compassion in this way, when your heart can truly express itself, you will have the foundation of Mahayana Buddhism.

With great compassion, bodhicitta can arise, and with bodhicitta, the outline of Mahayana Buddhism is established.

Section 3 May all sentient beings never leave the wonderful bliss without loss and suffering
The third of the four immeasurable heart texts is: May all sentient beings never be separated from the wonderful happiness without suffering. This is the heart of bliss.

Bliss is bliss without leakage, bliss that never disappears, never suffers.

All sentient beings hope to obtain this wonderful happiness, so we must send this heart, and wish all sentient beings to obtain wonderful happiness and never be lost.

Joy is when others are happy, we should also be happy: how good, I hope he can always be like this.

If people are happy, but I think: Oh, he is so happy, I am not happy.

This is jealousy, and this kind of mentality is not good.

How to be happy? First, think about the joys of those closest to you.

Visualize his happiness first, and then think: how good it would be if his happiness lasted forever, how good it would be if he never left.

Think about whether you can express this heart, and if you can express it, it will slowly spread to more people.

138

Now, many people are like this: they are not happy when others get rich, they are not happy when their neighbors get rich, their relatives are not happy when they get rich, their brothers are not happy when they get rich, and they are not happy when they are promoted.

There is no joy in this situation.

If you can think like this in your heart: how good it is for my brother to keep getting rich like this, how good his health is, how good it is to be smooth and prosperous.

If you can make your mind like this, then you have truly attained Fa-rectification.

If you haven't been able to initiate this kind of thought, you just haven't gotten the Fa-rectification yet, and chanting mantras is just the stuff of the skin.

In fact, reciting mantras is to help people understand these principles, and it is also a blessing to generate this kind of motivation.

When you truly get joy, you will never go bankrupt, you will never get sick, you will always be healthy, and all your happiness will never be lost.

Section 4 May all sentient beings stay away from love, hatred, relatives and estrangements, and live in equal homes
The fourth of the four immeasurable heart texts is: May all sentient beings stay away from love, hatred, relatives and estrangements, and live in equal equanimity.

This is heartbreak.

Our sentient beings are very attached, and we often think that this person is our relatives and friends, and we have greed; that person is our enemy, and we have a lot of hatred and hatred.

139

If you give up both greed and hatred, you will be very comfortable.

The pressure is gone, and the pressure is the result of these two worries.

Don't be greedy for relatives and friends, and don't have hatred for enemies. In fact, relatives and friends are equal to each other. There are no eternal relatives and friends, and there is no eternal enemy.

Today's relatives and friends will become tomorrow's enemies, and today's enemies will also become tomorrow's relatives and friends. This is the impermanence of the six realms of reincarnation.

In essence, all sentient beings are equal and should be treated with an equal mind, so we must always express our equanimity.

If we ourselves are greedy for our relatives and friends, we should make a vow to practice, hoping to get rid of greed one day earlier and have a balanced state of mind.

Section 5: The Key to Sending out the Four Immeasurable Hearts
The four immeasurable hearts are all the same, starting from the closest person, to the closer, then to the farther, and then to the common people.

When you send out the four immeasurable hearts to ordinary people, you must not send them vaguely together.

You have to find someone you know from among ordinary people, set your heart on him, and then expand to another person, and then to other ordinary people.

140

In the end, if you choose an ordinary person at random, and you can send out the four immeasurable minds without any obstacles, you will be considered a success.

After this achievement, try again to a certain opponent, and if you can really express it, then add it to other more enemies and opponents.

When one can send out loving-kindness or the four immeasurable hearts to all enemies, then one will truly achieve and become a great person.

Sending loving kindness and four immeasurable hearts is much more powerful than reciting mantras. This is the real Dharma and can truly change a person's heart and life.

Especially when it comes to expressing compassion and loving kindness, during this process, your body will change, your life will also change, and you will get a good improvement.

Many bodhisattvas meditate on the four immeasurable minds.

As soon as the bodhisattvas close their eyes, all they think about are sentient beings in the six realms. They visualize the sufferings of living beings. They should visualize every suffering, and hope that they will be free from these sufferings.

Not just from suffering, but from all the causes of suffering.

Then visualize the happiness that sentient beings have, and may they obtain these happiness, may they be healthy, obtain wealth, live a long life, and obtain food and clothing.

These are the four immeasurable minds, and that's what the Fa-rectification says.

Dharma is for people to be free from suffering and gain happiness. After understanding the merits of the four immeasurable minds, and having tasted the true flavor of Dharma, their body and mind will feel very comfortable.

At this time, she will think that all sentient beings are mothers who have great kindness to herself. If she is scolded, she will not be angry, because she knows that it is the troubles of sentient beings that make her angry.

Just imagine, if our dearest and most beloved mother goes crazy and beats and scolds us, we will not be angry.

Now, many people are tormented by afflictions, and we don't need to be angry with them. Only when we understand this is the true Fa-rectification.

Sometimes, when you can't think about anything else while meditating, you can think about all beings first.

There are more than seven billion people in the world, and there are many more in other worlds. I hope the happiness of these people will never be lost.

Think again about how many people are suffering, and then hope in your heart that these people are free from suffering and the causes of suffering.

How many people are unhappy, how many people are unhealthy, may he be happy, may he be healthy.

If you have a headache, may your head not hurt; if you have a stomachache, may your stomach recover soon; may beggars get rid of their pain and get rich soon, etc.

It’s good to think about it like this, and it’s okay to not read and post.

Chapter 9: The Four Great Wishes
All sentient beings are boundless vows to save endless troubles

The four major vows are very big vows.

One hundred thousand vows are made by a bodhisattva in one place, thousands of vows are made by a bodhisattva in two places, one billion vows are made by a bodhisattva in three places, and one hundred billion vows are made by a bodhisattva in four places.

The vows made by bodhisattvas from one place to ten places have increased hundreds of times, and the vows made by bodhisattvas of ten places are even more limitless, but all these vows can be summed up as these four vows.

143

The first section of the boundless vow of all sentient beings
Boundless vows to save sentient beings: We often talk about saving sentient beings. How can we save so many sentient beings? It is to make a vow: There are countless and boundless sentient beings in the six realms, I must save them, I vow to save all sentient beings, and not one will fall behind.

In order to save all sentient beings, I want to become a Buddha and make such a vow.

If you make this vow often, when the power of your vow matures, it will be incredible, and it will be able to save countless sentient beings.

Among the great siddhas in the Tibetan area, the former Kadampa master Bodova is recognized as a great siddha. Among those who practice with Bodova, there are more than 3,000 people who have achieved relatively great achievements.

When Master Bodova preached scriptures, he often told stories about birds and insects, which could save countless sentient beings.

Anyone who listens to the stories told by Master Bodova will practice hard, and this is because of the power of the Master's vows to save sentient beings in the past.

The second section of endless troubles and vows to end
Endless afflictions vow to cut off: afflictions have six root afflictions and twenty secondary afflictions.

144

The six root afflictions are: greed, hatred, delusion, arrogance, doubt, and wrong view.

We have a lot of troubles, this trouble is cut off, and that trouble comes out again, but no matter how many troubles, I swear to cut off.

Now, our troubles are not broken, they are temporarily suppressed, and they will come out.

If it is really broken, the troubles will not come out. Just like a big tree, if the branches are cut off, they will grow again after a while. If the roots are pulled out, the tree will not grow.

If our troubles are really cut off, they will never grow again.

Once greed is suppressed, greed will grow again, and when greed is cut off, afflictions will never grow again.

In front of an arahant, a lot of gold and silver treasures are piled up, and the arahant will not be greedy, because the arahant has stopped greed.

If a person breaks his hatred, no matter how he beats or scolds him, hatred will not arise.

To break off afflictions and stay away from bad karma also requires making a vow.

In the past, on the border between Tibet and Nepal, there were 500 people who killed buffalo. The buffalo is a very precious animal. Many people hope to save these hunters. There are many masters to persuade them not to kill buffalo, not to kill animals. They don't listen.

Later, Venerable Atisha went to the place where they were hunting. Venerable Venerable said nothing. After seeing Venerable, these hunters vowed not to hunt in the future. All because of Venerable Atisha's vows and blessings.

145

Section 3 Dharma Infinite Vows to Study
The Buddha Dharma is boundless and vows to learn: There are 84,000 Dharma disciplines in the Dharma, and some people feel that there are so many Dharma disciplines in the Tripitaka, and they can’t finish it if they want to learn it, so they don’t want to learn it.

We can't do that, we should think like this: If I can't finish my studies this year, I'll study them next year;

We must have this spirit, we must learn the highest point, and never give up.

There are more than 300 Tibetan scriptures in the Tibetan Tripitaka, including Tengyur and Ganyur. Many people have read them in their lifetime, and some have read it seven or eight times. The Buddhadharma is boundless and they vow to learn. This is very important.

Some people say that I don’t need to study much, we are getting old, we just need to recite Amitabha and some mantras.

This is not acceptable, you must learn, and you must learn when you are old.

Dharma King Yongzeng often said: These old people's ideas are wrong. You can't say that when I get old, I can't eat and I won't eat. When I get old, I have to learn.

The old monks in our Tibetan area, some older monks over 80 years old, can recite many scriptures in a year, and they have to take exams. Studying and practicing.

We also need this kind of spirit, and we learn often that we will never get Alzheimer's disease when we are old.

Listening to the Dharma is very important.

Hearing the Dharma requires the blessing of hearing the Dharma. Many people do not have this kind of blessing, and they need a great blessing.

The first condition is that you have been close to a teacher in a previous life.

The second condition is that not only have you been close to your guru, but you have also listened to your guru lecture, memorized some scriptures, and made offerings to Buddhas and Bodhisattvas. Only in this life can people with this kind of blessings hear the Dharma.

Those who do not have this kind of blessing cannot hear the Dharma.

Because these scriptures cannot be heard by them, nor do they want to hear them.

In Tibet, it can be said that almost 100% of the people believe in the Buddhadharma, and they all believe in it, but very few people can really hear the Buddhadharma, especially in the family. More, not to mention other places.

To study Buddhism, we must pay equal attention to both learning, thinking and cultivation.

Hearing the Dharma, thinking about the Dharma, and truly practicing are all equally important.

147

Some people say that retreating is important and listening to the Dharma is not, but this is wrong.

There are also people who say that meditation is very important and that listening to the Dharma is not important, which is also wrong.

If you don't listen to the scriptures and the Dharma, how can you meditate? If you want to meditate, you must first know the method of meditation, and if you want to retreat, you must first know the method of retreat, so that you will not practice blindly or chaotically, and waste your time to fill your body.

Section 4: The Supreme Vow of Buddhism and Dao Fulfillment
The supreme vow of Buddhahood is fulfilled: The Buddhadharma is the five ways: the way of resources, the way of practice, the way of seeing, the way of cultivation, and the way of non-cultivation.

The practice of Buddhism is difficult, and the achievement of vows is that I vow to be successful, and I want to become a Buddha.

In fact, it is difficult to practice before entering the Dao, but once you enter the Dao, the journey will be smooth.

Just like taking a plane, it is difficult to walk before you get on the plane, but once you get on the plane, it is easy to reach your destination. That's the truth.

If you cultivate bravely and diligently, you will be able to enter the Dao.

If you have attained the achievement of seeing the Tao, you will realize and realize emptiness; if you have attained the Tao of cultivation, you will be free of innate afflictions; if you have attained the Tao of non-cultivation, those who want to become an arahant become an arahant, and those who want to become a Buddha become a Buddha.

148

The four great vows are all very good. Everyone should make these vows often. After making these great vows, when you have reached a certain level of cultivation, and the strength of your vows has matured, it will be different. The great vows you made at the beginning will all come true, and the power of your vows is incredible.

149

Chapter 10 Opening verses
The supreme, profound and subtle Dharma has encountered countless calamities, and now I have seen, heard, received, held, vowed, and understood the true meaning of the Tathagata

The opening verses were written by Wu Zetian.

Wu Zetian was a Buddhist, and she was quite good in practice. She studied Buddhism with the Sixth Patriarch, Huineng, and often sent a minister with a strong memory to listen to the Dharma. The minister wrote down everything the Sixth Patriarch said, and then Speaking to Wu Zetian, she mainly used this method to study Buddhism.

The four lines of the opening verses contain the impermanence of life, the unpleasantness of the Buddha's teachings, and the unpleasant encounters with teachers.

150

The first section of the most profound and subtle method
The Supreme, Very Deep and Subtle Dharma: As far as the Xianzong is concerned, the Supreme, Very Deep and Subtle Dharma refers to the Prajna Sutra. It is not so difficult to encounter the Buddha, but it is very difficult to encounter the Prajna Sutra.

After some Bodhisattvas become Buddhas, they only teach the Hinayana, not the Mahayana, thinking that all living beings do not have the foundation of the Mahayana.

There are also some Buddhas and Bodhisattvas who, after attaining Buddhahood, only speak the ordinary scriptures in the Mahayana Buddhism, not the Prajna scriptures, because sentient beings have not heard the blessings of the Prajna scriptures, and they do not have this foundation. .

Therefore, the Prajna Sutra is the most profound and subtle Dharma in the Dharma door of the sutra. If you want to hear the Prajna Sutra, you must have great blessings.

It takes fifteen years for us to study the five great treatises, and the content is mainly the Prajna Sutra.

It is difficult to encounter the Prajna Sutra. In the past life, there must be a teacher who was close to him. Not only did he get close to the teacher, but he also listened to the teacher’s sutras, and also recited the sutras. After passing the precepts, seeing Bodhisattvas and Buddhas, and donating money to build a monastery, only this blessing can be obtained, and this subtle Dharma can be obtained.

The most extraordinary and supreme method in Xianzong is the Prajna Sutra.

The Prajna Sutra includes the Great Prajna Sutra, the Middle Prajna Prajna, and the Small Prajna Prajna, as well as the Prajna Eight Thousand Verses and the Prajna One Hundred Thousand Verses. There are seventeen prajna mothers and children, including the Diamond Sutra and the Heart Sutra.

151

Why is it called supreme? Buddha Shakyamuni once turned the wheel of Dharma three times. When he first turned the wheel of the Four Noble Truths, he taught the Hinayana, and he faced the disciples of Theravada. When he turned the wheel of the Dharma without signs, he mainly faced the Bodhisattvas. When the Falun of Righteousness cannot be reconciled, the disciples facing him include ordinary beings, saints, and all kinds of sentient beings.

The supreme, profound and subtle Dharma discussed here refers to the second turning of the Falun, and the second turning of the Flawless Law Wheel is the highest and most supreme Law Wheel.

The Buddha's first turning of the Dharma Wheel is for those with dull skills; the second turning of the Dharma Wheel is for those with sharp skills; the third turning of the Dharma Wheel is for those with medium skills.

Among these three kinds of root organs, those with medium root organs have many questions.

Those with dull roots have no doubts, they believe whatever the Buddha says.

The sharp-rooted person understood as soon as he heard it, and there was no doubt.

People with a medium foundation have many questions. They think: When Buddha Shakyamuni first turned the Dharma wheel, he talked about real appearances, but when he turned the Dharma wheel for the second time, he said that all dharmas and all things have no appearances and no self-nature. The statement seems to be contradictory.

How can this be explained? Therefore, Shakyamuni turned the Dharma wheel three times and talked about how the first and second revolutions are not contradictory. This is the content of the third revolution of the Dharma wheel, that is, only consciousness.

Some people have misunderstood Buddhism, thinking that the four aspects of ancient Indian Buddhism

152

Schools - there are the Ministries, the Classics Schools, the Consciousness-Only School, and the Madhyamika School. They think like this: The Buddha first taught the shallower Four Noble Dharma Door, and then the deeper Dharma Door of No Form, and the deepest one must be the three-turning of the Dharma Wheel.

This understanding is wrong.

When Shakyamuni turned the Dharma wheel three times, most of the disciples he faced were medium-level disciples.

Therefore, the prajna method in which the Buddha turns the formless Dharma wheel twice is the most extraordinary and supreme method, and the middle meditation is the most extraordinary and supreme method.

What does deep mean? The meaning of prajna is the wisdom of emptiness. After realizing emptiness, it is difficult to express in words and words, and what you have realized and realized cannot be expressed by yourself, so it is called profound.

The most powerful master recognized in Tibet is Master Tsongkhapa. Why do you say this? Master Tsongkhapa realized emptiness and expressed his achievements in words, because he is the incarnation of Manjushri, Manjushri is the deity of wisdom, and Master Tsongkhapa has the language ability of Manjushri.

As far as the tantric methods are concerned, the second step of the supreme yoga group is the supreme and profound subtle method.

Tantra's Dharma door has the Ministry of Affairs, the Ministry of Practice, the Ministry of Yoga, and the Ministry of Supreme Yoga.

Among them, the main methods of the Supreme Yoga Department are: the second step of Mahavira, the second step of Victory Vajra, the second step of Dakini Buddha, the second step of Kashgar, the second step of Kalachakra, and the second step of Mahayana Pradesh. King Kong's second second.

To encounter these second methods, even if it is one of them, such as the second method of the Dakini Buddha, to hear, encounter, and practice it requires a lot of good fortune. the door.

Chapter 2 Tens of thousands of calamities are encountered
Hundreds of thousands of kalpas are difficult to encounter: even hundreds or tens of millions of kalpas are difficult to encounter the Buddhadharma.

Now in the age of sage kalpas we are in, a thousand Buddhas can appear. Among these Buddhas, there are only four Buddhas who can teach esoteric Dharma, especially those who practice both esoteric and esoteric practices.

Other Buddhas don't talk about the double cultivation of esoteric and esoteric, because people don't have this blessing.

The fourth Buddha among the Thousand Buddhas of Xian Kalpa is Shakyamuni Buddha, the eleventh Buddha is the Buddha of Good Eyes, also known as the Buddha of Good Wisdom, the fiftyth Buddha is the Lion Roar Buddha, and the last Buddha is the Buddha of Faith and Vow According to the classic records, it can be inferred that these four Buddhas can not only teach the practice of Hinayana, but also teach the methods of Mahayana Sutra and Tantra, especially the method of dual practice of Sutra and Tantra.

154

However, it is very difficult to meet these four Buddhas. Some people can meet these four Buddhas, but they cannot meet the Dharma door of dual cultivation of sutra and esoteric, because there is no such blessing or fate.

We know that among the disciples of Buddha Shakyamuni, many people have encountered the practice of Hinayana, but not the practice of Mahayana; there are still many people who have encountered the practice of Mahayana Buddhism, but have not encountered the practice of Mahayana Tantra; some people have encountered the practice of Mahayana The Dharma door of Tantra, but the Dharma door of Mahayana Sutra was not encountered.

It is very rare to encounter the blessings and fates of the Mahayana Xian-tantric dual practice method. Among the thousands of Buddhas of the Xianjie, 996 Buddhas do not teach the esoteric method, because the sentient beings in that period would not have such blessings or fate.

It is very difficult to come across Prajna Sutra.

We have been reincarnated countless times in the six cycles of reincarnation for hundreds of thousands of kalpas, and it is only in this life that we encounter the Prajna Sutra.

You may have never read the Heart Sutra in your previous life, but in this life you have encountered the Heart Sutra and read the Heart Sutra, and a seed of very complete liberation has been planted in your heart, and we will see when this seed germinates in the future.

Therefore, it is very difficult for us to meet the Dharma-rectification of Master Tsongkhapa's double cultivation of sutras.

Among the Panchen Lama of all dynasties, the fourth Panchen Lama has the most powerful supernatural powers. When the fourth Panchen Lama was alive, there was a Mongolian master who was a master. He bowed to the fourth Panchen Lama three times and said that he had some questions to ask. .

155

The Fourth Panchen Lama said, what is your problem? This Mongolian master said, if I practice like this, will I be able to obtain a human body full of leisure in my next life? The master looked at it with his supernatural powers and said: Yes.

Inner Mongolia master asked again, can I become a master who promotes Buddhism in my next life? The Fourth Panchen Lama said that it is also possible.

The Mongolian master asked again, can I get Master Tsongkhapa's inheritance of the mind? The Fourth Panchen Lama said that to get this great blessing, you have to be more diligent to be able to do it, because the Dharma of Tsongkhapa's double cultivation is the most quintessential method.

Don't talk about encountering Master Tsongkhapa's Dharma. People need great blessings to encounter the eighteen books of Master Tsongkhapa's teaching of the Dharma.

Although most of our believers are Gelug's disciples, only one or two percent can encounter the Dharma of Master Tsongkhapa.

How can it be considered to have met the Dharma of Master Tsongkhapa? First of all, we must understand the "Guangdong Theory of the Bodhi Path", not only to understand, but also to practice according to the extensive theory.

This kind of practice is the foundation. On this basis, you can become a Buddha once you practice the second stage of the Supreme Yoga of Tantra.

Only in this way can we truly meet the Dharma of Master Tsongkhapa.

Hundreds of thousands of calamities were encountered.

Master Gazang Qusong often said: It is not difficult to encounter Buddhas, but it is difficult to encounter the Dharma door of double cultivation.

Now that we have come across the method of dual cultivation of sutra and esoteric, we have the wish-fulfilling treasure. Let this wish-fulfilling treasure work well, or whether it should be thrown into the trash can, this is our business, it depends on our diligence and our wisdom.

With a wish-fulfilling treasure, it is useless to throw it in the trash can.

Now, we have obtained the wish-fulfilling treasure, and we have also worshipped Master. Master is like a treasure mountain. It is not good to abandon the treasure mountain and return empty-handed. We must bring something back. If we can get pearls, we will take pearls, and if we can get diamonds, we will take them. For diamonds, if you can get the wish-fulfilling treasure, you can get the wish-fulfilling treasure back, and returning it empty-handed is meaningless.

Section 3 Now I have seen and heard the true meaning of the Tathagata.
Now I have seen, heard, accepted, and held the true meaning of the Tathagata: For such a rare and subtle Dharma, I am fortunate to be able to hear, see, and accept and uphold it. Therefore, I would like to truly understand the root of the true Dharma spoken by the Buddha. Righteousness.

The law is difficult to understand, and the scriptures are also difficult to understand.

In order to understand the scriptures, many conditions are required, and one must not obey the law.

What the Buddha said, you must follow the law, not according to the understanding of a certain Dharma master, you must follow the law and not follow the people, and you must follow the righteousness and not follow the righteousness scriptures.

157

There are a lot of erroneous viewpoints right now. Some people say that this is what the Master said, and that is what the Master said. If the Master says something wrong, he will follow suit.

The Liberal Army Dharma Master was a very high-achieving dharma master in India at that time. He wrote some articles, which contained some errors. His disciple Fazheng Dianshi was even more powerful than him. The Liberal Army said to Fazheng, "You have to refute me." 's writings cannot be passed on in such a wrong way.

After Master's permission, Master Facheng wrote "The Theory of Interpretation", refuting the mistakes in the works of Master Free Army. The Liberty Army said: "Wrong is wrong, and we must not obey people according to the law."

If you don’t follow the Yoshitsune, you can’t follow the Yoshitsune. What is the Yoshitsune? It is the common Dharma door taught by the Buddha, and we can practice according to it; the non-common Dharma door, under normal circumstances, cannot be practiced according to the guidance.

Among these dharmas, some are taught to bodhisattvas of the tenth level, which can only be learned by the bodhisattvas of the tenth level, but ordinary people do not understand and cannot learn it, and some are taught to the bodhisattvas of the eighth level, and some are taught to the yaksa, and so on.

For example, on the issue of whether or not Buddhists can eat meat, there are many teachings.

There is a scripture that says that you can eat the three clean meats. What does the three clean meats refer to? Strictly speaking, it means killing for me, but I have not heard, seen, or suspected that it was killed for me. In this case, it is called Sanjing Meat and can be eaten.

158

In another scripture, it is said that even the three clean meats cannot be eaten.

Then, who are the subjects of these two sutras? Let’s examine the sutras. The first sutra was taught to ordinary monks. At that time, some monks asked the Buddha, “What should we do if we go to seek alms and can’t find anything to eat?” ? Buddha said, you can eat three pure meat.

In another scripture, you can't even eat the three clean meats. This was said to some savages who liked to eat human flesh at that time, and their habit of eating human flesh was very heavy.

The four reliances on the four laws and the four disrespects are: the laws do not depend on people, and the Buddha's scriptures should be used as the basis, not someone's personal opinions.

According to the meaning not the language, it should be based on the classics, not on the language and words that are piled up with ornate rhetoric.

Relying on Wisdom, Not on Consciousness: It should be based on the discernment and wisdom of objective facts, not on the feeling of subjective experience. In particular, it is necessary to say that emptiness cannot be realized by the five senses of eyes, ears, nose, tongue, and body. , can only rely on consciousness.

If you follow the Yoshitsune, you can’t follow the Yoshitsune: You must rely on the ultimate Buddhist principles of the Yoshitsune, and don’t rely on the convenient interpretation of the Yoshitsune.

159

Chapter Eleven of the Collection of Laws
Do not do evil, do good, and pursue self-purification. This is all Buddhism.

When someone asks what Buddhism is, just read the above few sentences and you will understand.

Do not do any evil, evil refers to evil karma, and do not do evil karma.

All good deeds are practiced, good deeds refer to good deeds, and good deeds must be done.

To purify oneself, one’s body, speech, and mind must be pure, and especially one’s mind must be free from evil thoughts and distracting thoughts.

It is all Buddhists, and what they teach is all about goodness. This is Buddhism.

Chapter 1 Don't Do Evil
Do not do all evils: We Buddhists must do all evils and do not do all the ten evil deeds.

160

There are ten evil karma: killing, stealing, licentiousness, lying, gossip, evil speech, flattery, greed, hatred, and clinging to wrong views. None of these can be done.

There are many kinds of ten evil karma, and many of them are very large evil karma, such as the five unrelenting sins: killing father, mother, killing arahants, destroying Buddha statues, and destroying Sangha. These are relatively large evil karma.

Slandering the Dharma, Buddhas and Bodhisattvas is also a great evil karma.

Do not do any evil, do not do all evil karma, and do not do it.

For people, whether they believe in Buddhism or not, if they do ten evil karma, they will naturally have bad retribution.

It's not that they don't repay, it's just that the karma has not been combined or the time has not come.

Section 2 Doing the Good
All good deeds: We Buddhists must do all good deeds, all good deeds, big and small, and good deeds.

Good karma mainly refers to the ten good karma: no killing, no stealing, no sexual misconduct, no lying, no double tongue, no evil words, no slander, no greed, no hatred, and no wrong views.

There are many other good deeds. The six paramitas, that is, generosity, precepts, patience, diligence, meditation, and wisdom are all good deeds.

161

Doing good deeds means doing all the good deeds that can be done.

If you do ten good deeds, you will be rewarded with good deeds.

The third section is to purify the meaning of Buddhism
The meaning of self-purification: one must be pure in body, speech, and mind. How can the body be pure? Keep away from killing, stealing, and sexual immorality, and the body will be purified.

When one cultivates to a high level of Tantric Buddhism, when one visualizes the body as a deity, the body is also pure.

How is the mouth clean? Keep away from the four kinds of verbal karma: lying, double tongue, evil speech, and flattering speech. Keep away from these four mouths and you will be pure.

When one cultivates to a relatively high level of Tantra, visualizing all the internal and external sounds as mantras will also result in a clean mouth.

To be pure of mind means to be pure of heart, that is, not to be greedy.

When the mind is free from greed, anger, and wrong views, the mind becomes pure.

After cultivating to the high level of Tantra, the mind often observes emptiness and happiness, and the mind is also pure.

When your heart is truly pure, you will be free from afflictions, and you will be liberated when you get rid of afflictions.

Only Buddhism talks about cutting off afflictions and liberating and becoming a Buddha. Other religions don’t talk about these things, and they don’t have them.

162

The true meaning of self-purification is only found in Buddhism, not in other religions.

Buddhism has gone through a history of more than 2,500 years, but in the history of Buddhism, there has never been a war, nor a war because of Buddhism, especially a war waged by Buddhists.

In other religions, especially in modern times, most of the wars in the world are caused by religious disputes.

It is all Buddhism: whether it is the teachings of the Buddha or the verification of the Dharma, the biggest effect of studying Buddhism is to purify one's mind.

If you truly learn Buddhism, you will stay away from bad karma and do more good deeds. This is the true meaning of Buddhism.

One should be pure in body, speech, and mind, not participate in evil or evil deeds, and do the best possible good deeds. This is the Buddhadharma.

Vajrasattva Mantra Wheel

Chapter 12 Postscript
If you can hear it, you can hear it, if you can say it, you can speak it, you can hear it, you can't tell it, don't give up, pass your heart, say nothing, say nothing, say sages, minds, and expedients for enlightenment

Both the postscript and Huayan verses are based on the views of the Consciousness-Only Sect.

Let’s briefly talk about it here first. Once the concept of the Consciousness-Only School is clearly explained, the meaning of these two verses will be understood.

The Origin of Consciousness-Only Sect The founder of Consciousness-Only Sect is Wusang Bodhisattva.

Wusang Bodhisattva is from Nepal. Nepal belonged to India in ancient times. He has a half-brother called Shiqin.

At that time, Mahayana Buddhism was almost extinct in India. The mother of Wusang Bodhisattva had a wish that her son could carry forward the Mahayana Buddhism. Therefore, when Wusang Bodhisattva was born, he wrote Manjushri on his tongue. The seed word of her, and let her son become a monk from an early age.

Therefore, Bodhisattva Wusang became a monk at a very young age.

When he was in his twenties, he felt that what he had learned was not very complete, it was superficial and not deep enough.

He believes that Mahayana Buddhism was passed on to the two Bodhisattvas Manjushri and Maitreya by Sakyamuni.

Wusang Bodhisattva chose Maitreya Bodhisattva, so he practiced Maitreya Bodhisattva's method and recited Maitreya Bodhisattva's mantra.

Twelve years later, he saw Maitreya Bodhisattva with his own eyes and asked him for the Dharma. Maitreya Bodhisattva took him to the Tusita Tian Maitreya Temple and stayed there for an hour.

An hour in the Maitreya Academy is equivalent to fifty years in the world. During this hour, Maitreya Bodhisattva passed on the Maitreya Five Sutras and taught a lot of Mahayana Buddhism.

After he finished speaking, Wusang Bodhisattva fully understood the Mahayana Dharma, and Maitreya Bodhisattva sent him back to the human world and said to him: You must go to the human world to spread the Mahayana Dharma.

165

When the Bodhisattva Wusang returned to the human world, his younger brother, Shiqin, also became a monk. He was already an old monk, but he joined the Theravada School.

Wusang Bodhisattva told his younger brother about the Mahayana Dharma, once or twice, but his relatives did not approve of it, they did not recognize the Mahayana Dharma, and believed that the Hinayana did not have these, and the Buddha did not teach this Dharma, and it was a false creation of the intangible.

The wisdom of the master of the world is very high. He has been using the wisdom of Theravada to seek liberation and find a way to liberation.

He asked his master: what is "people without self", and after master explained it, he understood.

But he felt that these were not thorough, so he was still not satisfied, and kept saying to his master: These are too shallow, I understand them all.

Master also said, "People have no ego" means that people do not exist physically and mentally, and if they do not exist inside and outside, then you will understand that "people have no ego".

But Shiqin felt that these concepts were wrong and wanted to refute his master.

In the evening, the relatives lit an oil lamp and searched everywhere in the house, and also went to every monk's house to find it.

People asked him: What are you doing? He said he was looking for me: I was looking for me, but I couldn't find it. Master said that there is no me, but if there is no me, how can I be free? Master Shiqin went back and said to his master: I have it, but I can't find me now.

When he said this, Master understood, and he was not too happy to say, from today onwards, I don't care where you go, I can't control you.

166

Master Shiqian went to the sect of sutras to study, and after making some progress, he believed that the concept of sects of sutras was more reasonable and deeper than that of some sects, and his understanding of Buddhism was better than that of some sects.

Wusang Bodhisattva himself is from the Mahayana middle school. When he was studying in the Youbu school, he complained to Maitreya Bodhisattva: I am now even difficult for my own brother, how can I save others? Maitreya Bodhisattva said: You want to create the Consciousness-Only Sect. Consciousness-Only can save your younger brother, and also save many people, which will be of great benefit to all sentient beings.

In this way, Wusang Bodhisattva founded the Consciousness-Only Sect, and his younger brother also joined the Consciousness-Only Sect. After studying with Wusang Bodhisattva, the master of the world learned that he had done a lot of verbal karma and slandered Mahayana Buddhism. To cultivate the Dharma Door of Tongue Vajra, after the cultivation is completed, one can recite the Great Prajna Sutra seventy-two times a day.

A few years ago, a master who passed away in Tibet also cultivated Tongue King Kong, and finally achieved Tongue King Kong.

When he orally transmitted the Tripitaka, he could read ten thick sutras every day, and asked two lamas, one on the left and one on the right, to quickly turn the scriptures for him.

The scriptures that everyone is very familiar with, such as the Great White Umbrella Canopy, Tara's Prayer, etc., when he recites it, he recites it as if it were played on a tape, quickly but clearly.

167

After the world-relative Bodhisattva cultivated the Tongue Vajra, he recited many sutras every day, and slowly eliminated the karma of slandering the Mahayana Buddhism, and he truly achieved it.

Although his achievements are not very high, they are already relatively high among the Consciousness-Only Sect.

Section 2 If you can hear it, you can hear it, if you can speak it, you can say it with your heart
Can hear and speak

The main idea of ​​the Consciousness-Only School is that all things in the universe are inner changes.

The change of all things in the universe is the change of the heart. When there is a change in the heart, only the external environment outside the heart can change. Everything in the universe is the reaction of the inner world.

If you can hear it, only your heart can hear it, if you can speak it, you can only speak your mind, you can hear it, you can speak it, and you don’t want to be distracted.

After the ear-consciousness is moved, it is only possible to hear because of the change of the ear-consciousness.

If you are in meditation, your ear-consciousness will not move, you will not be able to hear, because the eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, and mind are all fixed in meditation, and you cannot hear or smell, even if someone speaks loudly beside your ear , can not hear, because the heart does not move, the ears do not work; the eye consciousness does not move, the eyes do not work, and you cannot see.

168

This is the concept of Consciousness-Only.

In the past, when Buddha Shakyamuni talked about this, a prince in ancient India did not believe that what was in front of him could not be seen with his eyes, but he saw with his heart.

He said, are there eyes and ears that don't work? Are there any ears that can't hear? Buddha Shakyamuni said, you can try it.

You call the prisoner who is going to be beheaded here, give him a basin, fill it with oil, and say to him, take the basin full of oil and walk a hundred paces, if a drop of oil drips out , cut off your head immediately.

If you don't spill a drop, save you from death.

After saying this, the singer and dancer next to him continued to sing and dance.

As a result, the prisoner walked a hundred paces slowly, without a drop of oil dripping out.

Ask the prisoner, how are you singing today? He said, I didn't hear it.

Do you dance well or not? The prisoner replied, I didn't see it.

His heart wasn't on those things, so his ears couldn't hear and his eyes couldn't see.

Here it is said: If you can hear and hear only with your heart, if you can speak only with your heart, you can hear and speak without being distracted.

When we ask several people to evaluate a person, we usually come to the following conclusion: some people think he is a good person, some people think he is a bad person, some people think he has shortcomings, and some people think he has advantages.

Views are different, these are all made by the mind, and you will have different views on things.

This is what it means when everything is created only with the mind.

169

Consciousness-only schools believe that the quality of a person, the quality of all things in the universe, and a person's view of good and bad are all changes in the heart, and these things do not exist in the external environment.

For example, when looking at a person, his relatives and friends see him as a very good person, but his enemies will see him as a very bad person. Ordinary people see him as neither good or bad. These are caused by the human heart.

In the same way, a person can be regarded as good, ordinary, and bad. However, it is impossible for a person to be a good person and a bad person at the same time. Therefore, good or bad is caused by the heart of the person who sees him.

For example, a glass of water is seen by humans as a glass of water, by gods and humans as nectar, and by hungry ghosts as pus and blood, and the same glass of water, why are there so many views? Because it's all about the heart.

Hungry ghosts have heavy mental karma, which looks like pus and blood; the blessings of gods and humans are great, they look like nectar, and they drink nectar.

Consciousness-only people often say that the heart must be pure.

If the mind is truly pure, the human world is a world of bliss.

Sometimes, our hearts run out, and when someone speaks in our ear, we can’t hear it; it moves in front of us, but we can’t see it. It’s all caused by our heart.

Therefore, we must study Buddhism, practice, cultivate and correct our hearts, and make our hearts tolerant and pure.

He can hear and speak without being distracted, and what he hears, what he sees, all his words and deeds, never leave his heart.

170

Consciousness-only ideas are like this.

There are also different concepts within the Consciousness-Only Sect, which is divided into the Real Consciousness-Only Sect and the False Appearance Consciousness-Only Sect.

Reality-only consciousness, also known as existence-only consciousness and truth-only consciousness, believes that what the eyes see is actual existence.

False appearance-only consciousness is also known as non-phase-only consciousness and virtual appearance-only consciousness. It believes that the external environment seen by the eyes is a false appearance, that it exists as thought, not actual existence.

It is like looking at a colored bottle. There are various colors of white, green, blue, and red on the bottle. When looking at the bottle, look at it with different hearts, and you can see the various colors on the bottle.

There is a kind of Consciousness-only school that thinks that it is enough to look at this colored bottle with one kind of heart, instead of looking at each color one by one.

Would it be correct to see only one color of the bottle? If it is correct, and other people see the same color, then the color of this external environment exists.

However, the color that everyone sees will not be the same. Some people see this colored bottle as red and think it is very beautiful; some people see this bottle as white and think it is not beautiful.

Some people see it as just an ordinary bottle and don't feel anything; people who are interested in this bottle will like it when they see it, and there are many different opinions.

171

Therefore, in the external world, this bottle does not exist, and all things in the universe do not exist in the external environment, let alone be attached.

If you see your own enemy now, don't cling to him as an enemy, and don't get angry, because he is not necessarily your own enemy.

Because our minds are still not well cultivated, once our minds change, our views on them will change; once our views change, they will also change, and they will change as our own minds change.

When someone who treats us badly first appears, my heart looks at him and thinks: Oh, he treats me badly.

Then, the mind became more and more attached, thinking repeatedly: He is my enemy, this is not good for me, that is not good.

In this way, it will gradually become more and more painful, and eventually he will really become his enemy.

Now, we need to take back this mentality and not be attached to him as an enemy, because he is not necessarily an enemy, he may have been in the past, and he may not be in the future. In the past, he may have had a wrong view and never thought about these issues and so on.

Thinking about it now, there are many problems: I may be wrong, he is not the kind of person I imagined.

Once this concept is taken back, it will naturally change. This is the best way for the Consciousness-Only Sect to change people's views.

When we love someone very much, we will feel that he is good in all aspects, but is it as good as we think? If we think about it again, it should not be, and it should not be so good.

172

With this thought, when the heart is recovered, it will not be so greedy for him, and there will be no pain for oneself.

Therefore, our views on all things are all sent out by our hearts first, and then our thoughts slowly change, and everything in the universe changes with our hearts. This is an important point of view of the Consciousness-Only School.

When many people develop bodhicitta together, their hearts can be easily changed, and they can change the hearts of all people.

You will see that there are no enemies, and you will withdraw your view of seeing others as enemies. You will feel that all sentient beings are your own mothers. When you have this view, you will withdraw all your bad thoughts.

Now, scientists are also studying the four elements of earth, water, fire, wind and the universe. For the four elements, if we scold and get angry at the four elements, the four elements will also become bad; will also improve.

For example, the surrounding area of ​​Tuola Temple used to be bare, with almost no grass growing, and nothing could grow. Now it is slowly growing, because monks’ practice is getting better and better. After reaching a certain level, the surrounding environment Changes will occur, grass grows in places where grass does not grow, and trees grow.

Therefore, the universe is also changing according to people's hearts.

When the world is about to be destroyed, how will the human heart become? The Buddhist scriptures say that people at that time would become unrecognized as father and son, fathers do not want sons, sons do not want parents, I kill you, you kill me, the ten evil karma will become more and more prosperous, and in the end, the world will be destroyed.

When the evil karma reaches the top level, the world will be destroyed, and it will not be destroyed when it is not reached. It is all related to the human heart.

During the Cultural Revolution, many cultural relics were destroyed, trees were cut down in many places, and the environment deteriorated. Now, the country advocates harmony and people are encouraged to be kind, people are gradually getting better, and the natural environment is also better. , where there are no trees, there are trees. These are all changed because of the change of people's hearts.

Section 3 Saying nothing but saying that the sages' hearts are convenient for the ordinary hearts
Universal wish to confuse all sentient beings to the Buddha's wonderful mind and liberation

Without saying anything, the sages' minds are convenient for the enlightened minds to say: After truly realizing emptiness, in the meditation of emptiness, you can't speak, and you can't teach the Dharma.

Only Buddhas can do things in meditation. Except for Buddhas, Arahants can’t do things in meditation, and they can’t hear other people’s speeches.

We need to understand emptiness accurately and avoid falling into stubborn emptiness.

In the past, Chinese Buddhism was also spread to Tibetan areas, and it was very successful for a period of time. Later, a great monk named Mahayana came to Tibetan areas to teach the Dharma. Into the stubborn void.

He said that you don't need to think about anything when you practice, just stay stupid, stay as long as you can, and this is the way to real liberation.

Also, don't do good, don't do evil, good and evil are like handcuffs on a person's hands, golden handcuffs and iron handcuffs are the same binding on people, so doing good and doing evil are the same, both will be trapped in samsara. If you can't jump out, the ten evil karma is the cause of the three evil paths, which is a kind of reincarnation; the ten good karma is the cause of the human and heavenly fruit, and you can't jump out, and you can't be liberated.

For another example, the black cloud covers the sky and the sun cannot be seen, but the white cloud covers it, and the same is true.

In this way, this Han monk cited 80 such examples, and believed that these stubborn and empty Fa were true Fa.

Later, some masters in the Tibetan area debated with this Chinese monk, and when the debate came to a tit-for-tat, at this time, the Tibetan king did not know who was talking about the righteous Dharma or who fell into stubbornness, so he sent someone to India to invite lotus flowers. Master Jie, he will preside over and determine who is right.

As soon as Master Lianhuajie came to argue with the Han monk, the Han monk lost the argument and ran away, and his disciples all returned to the Han region.

Since then, masters in the Han region have rarely traveled to Tibetan areas to spread the Fa.

175

The universal wish that all sentient beings bewildered by the mind can be liberated by the Buddha's wonderful mind: no matter what we say or what we do, it is all driven by the mind. People are the slaves of the mind, and the mind is the master of them.

When a person becomes the master of the heart, the heart will listen to the words of the person, and then the person will be freed.

176

Chapter Thirteen Huayan Verses
If one wants to know all the Buddhas of the three times

You should observe the nature of the Dharma Realm, everything is created only by your mind

The Huayan verse means that if sentient beings want to truly understand the true Dharma bodies of all Buddhas in the past, present, and future, they should observe the true nature of all dharmas in the world, that is, the true nature of the world, and will find that everything is created by their own minds. Yes, it's our hearts fantasizing.

Section 1 If one wants to know all the Buddhas in the three times
If one wants to know: To know means to know and understand.

177

To know means to want to know, to understand.

The difference between an ordinary person and a wise person lies in whether they understand the principles of Buddhism and the true meaning of the Dharma.

When it was just dark, a rope was rolled on the ground. When people saw it, they thought it was a snake. When they have this kind of heart, they have fear.

However, this kind of fear is created by one's own mind. The rope is not a snake. It is one's mind that treats it as a snake. If the mind doesn't think it is a snake, then there is no fear.

In the same way, when our hearts regard others as enemies, we have fear towards them, and when we regard others as wicked, we have fear and resentment towards wicked people.

All things and all dharmas are created by the mind. This is the concept of the Consciousness-Only School, and it is also a concept of understanding the world in Buddhism, but it is not the highest and most thorough concept.

Because Madhyamika refuted its concept, to understand Madhyamika, we must first understand the concept of Consciousness-Only School.

Thinking and adhering to the concepts of the Consciousness-Only Sect, you have truly succeeded in your cultivation. After you understand the concepts of Consciousness-Only Sect, it will be of great help in understanding emptiness. Then you can enter the study of Madhyamika, and then you will realize emptiness and finally be liberated. .

The four schools are like steps. There are one, two, three, and four steps in learning and cultivation.

All Buddhas in the Three Worlds: Refers to the past, present, and future Buddhas.

178

The second section should observe the dharma realm, all idealistic creations
One should observe the nature of the Dharma Realm: observe that the ten Dharma Realms and other external environments do not exist.

Everything is created only by the mind: all sentient beings in the Ten Dharma Realms are created by their own mind.

The mind creates the Dharma realm, and the mind is the Dharma realm. This is the concept of the Consciousness-Only School.

The Ten Dharma Realms are the places where sentient beings of the six realms, sravakas, karmic enlighteners, bodhisattvas, and buddhas live.

Sentient beings in the six realms refer to hells, hungry ghosts, bystanders, human realms, asuras, and heaven realms. Sentient beings in the six realms do not possess perfect wisdom, and many do evil karma.

All sentient beings in the Ten Dharma Realms are the same, and everything is created by the mind.

Going to hell is also a mind that sends us to hell. Falling into the animal realm is also created by our own mind, becoming a Buddha is also created by our mind, and liberation and achievement of Arahantship are also created by our mind.

How to change one’s mind is based on cause and effect. If one’s mind becomes bodhicitta, one becomes a bodhisattva. If one’s mind becomes very evil, one becomes a demon. If one’s mind becomes good, one is a good person. If one’s mind is cunning, one becomes a cunning person.

Looking at the Ten Dharma Realms, they are all formed by the transformation of the mind.

179

Chapter 14 The Law of Karma
All dharmas arise from conditions, all dharmas die from conditions

I, the great monk of the Buddha, often say this

There are two schools of Mahayana, the Consciousness-Only School and the Madhyamika School.

"Postscript" and "Huayan Verse" are about the Consciousness-Only School, and the following "Cause and Condition Law", "Vajra Verse", and "Zhongguan Verse", these three are about the Mahayana Madhyamika School.

All dharmas are born from karma: all dharmas and all things are born from the combination of karma.

Not only must there be a cause, but also a predestined relationship, without which one cannot be born.

All dharmas perish from conditions: Extinction also has reasons for extinction.

Especially the predestined relationship of extinction, human beings have the predestination of death, and the cause of death may be the karma of the previous life or the present life, but if there is no predestination to prevent the extinction, the combination of causes and conditions will cause the person to die.

The same is true of eliminating suffering. The combination of causes and conditions can eliminate suffering.

180

My Buddha, the great recluse, often said this: Buddha often said this.

All dharmas are made up of karma.

For example, a cup requires a lot of materials and a machine to make the cup. All these are karma.

There is no single independent law. For example, the sky is also created by dependent origination. It also has all directions, and when combined, it is the sky.

All dharmas are divided dharmas, so what is the dharma with participation? For example, a thing can be divided into all directions, with an upper layer and a lower layer. If it is further divided, there are more subtle molecules and atoms, and the atoms can be further divided.

Therefore, all dharmas are participatory dharmas.

In Beijing, I met a Chinese scientist in the United States. He divided molecules and atoms into one level, and he could see many things, many large and small universes.

It is said in "Pu Xian Xing Xian Ping" that "there are as many dusts in a single dust", and a quantum or molecule has countless Buddhas and countless pure lands on it.

The Buddha said that all dharmas are participatory dharmas, and they are all combined by karma.

It sounds rather esoteric and difficult to understand, but if the blessings are enough and you study Buddhism well, it will be easy to understand.

All dharmas arise from conditions: All dharmas are born from conditions.

Here we all need to understand cause and effect.

There is also a condition between cause and effect, which can only be produced by combining cause and effect.

181

The karma is not the result. When the karma is combined, the result will come out. When the time comes, the result will come out.

When planting crops, the seed is the cause, and water, sunlight, and a suitable climate are the conditions for the seed.

When the seed encounters these conditions, it will germinate and bear fruit.

If there is no fate, no amount of seeds will germinate. We often see that there are so many seeds in the warehouse, without encountering water, nor encountering a suitable climate, and the main fate has not been encountered, so we just Does not germinate.

Health also has its causes and conditions.

The cause of health is releasing animals, etc. The cause of being healthy is exercising the body, that is, hygiene in life, etc. When causes and conditions are combined, one will be healthy.

Wealth is the same.

The cause of wealth is generosity, making offerings to the Three Jewels is generosity, making donations in society is generosity, and helping those in need is generosity. These are the causes of wealth.

What is the fate of wealth? Wisdom and interpersonal relationships are the predestined relationship to wealth. Encountering a really good project is the predestination of wealth. Only by combining karma and predestination can we obtain wealth.

What do we all need to know here? Many people suffer from heavy karma, but in some respects, their blessings are also great.

If karma encounters bad karma, evil retribution will come out; if good karma encounters good karma, good retribution will also come out.

182

We practitioners believe in cause and effect, so how should we cultivate? It is to accumulate as many blessings as possible and do all kinds of help. The blessings can be accumulated, and the help can also be created.

It is impossible for me to think that I have great blessings, and I should also get wealth without being a helper myself.

There must be a helping fate. If the blessing cannot wait for the good fate, it will not be available in this life, and it may come out in the next life. If you cannot wait in the next life, you must continue to wait until you meet the fate, and the blessing will definitely come out.

We practitioners try to combine good causes and conditions, and then wait for a certain period of time.

Just like planting the seeds, you still have to wait, and it will take a day or two, two or three days if you are quick.

If karma is not combined, the time will not come.

It doesn't matter if the karma is heavy, how can you avoid karma? To stay away from the karma of evil, don't let karma and karma touch, keep a certain distance, and the evil will not come out.

People's karma does not meet fate in this life, and the evil retribution will not come out, but the karma will not disappear naturally, but will be brought to the next life.

Will always wait for the fate of evil, and when it is, the evil will come out.

We must understand these truths.

When you understand the truth, you will understand where your problem lies.

When we recite sutras and make offerings to protect the Dharma, we are accumulating blessings and eliminating karmic obstacles. With blessings and the blessings of Buddhas, Bodhisattvas and Dharma protectors, good karma will be closer.

183

Chapter 15 Vajra verse
All conditioned dharmas are like dream bubbles, like dew, and electricity should act like this.

These four lines are the most essential parts of the Diamond Sutra. The popular explanation is: All dharmas are born when conditions are gathered, and disappear when conditions are scattered. , dew, electricity.

These six metaphors are also often used in Buddhist scriptures when the Buddha talks about Dependent Origination. Apart from these, there are many other metaphors.

Verse is the meaning of poetry.

Usually four sentences are called a verse.

There are twenty-eight verses, ten or more, thirty, and so on.

184

The first section of everything that is possible is like a dream bubble
All conditioned dharmas are like a dream bubble: the dharma here refers to all phenomena in the world, and conditioned means to be constituted by causation or conditions.

Such as the dream bubble: fantasy is an illusion.

When dreaming, people are conscious and feel that the things in the dream are very real, and only when they wake up can they realize that they are false.

That is to say, everything is a combination of karma, temporary, and unreal like a dream bubble. Once the conditions for the existence of things change, things disappear.

The essence of the Diamond Sutra is this verse, which has two levels of interpretation.

The first is to talk about impermanence. When impermanence comes, especially the great impermanence and death, some people live to the age of 80. When they are about to die, think about it. In the past 80 years, whether it is pain or happiness, it is really like It was a dream.

I am 50 years old this year, and during these 50 years, I sometimes recall it as if I had a dream.

When a cultivator realizes impermanence, he will not be attached, the pain of the past has passed, he will not hold grudges, and he will not be attached.

The scenery of the past is also a thing of the past, and it does not matter now.

People who have not practiced do not understand impermanence, they will feel how good they were in the past, they will always think about the past, and if they can't let go, they will bring a lot of pain.

185

The second level has a deeper meaning and is explained in terms of emptiness.

Everything we know now is an illusion.

For example, when we always talk about "I", many people are unable to settle down and think: Where am I? who I am? In the body? Or outside the body? Is it one or different from the Five Aggregates? If it is one with my body, then, after I die, if my body is cremated, I will also be cremated, then how can I be reincarnated? Therefore, it does not make sense that I and the five aggregates are one.

If someone slaps me in the face, he will say he slapped me, but not my face, because usually, we all think that I and the five aggregates are inseparable.

So, what is this "I" that is inseparable from the body? What is actually a fake, is the fake me.

With this kind of false appearance, I will have a lot of troubles.

For example, when he hits me, I will become angry; if I love her, I will become greedy, and whenever I am there, I will become troubled.

It's someone else's, I won't be troubled, he was beaten by someone else, I don't think it doesn't matter, he's angry when he hits me.

He hit my relatives, he hit my children, brothers, sisters, and I would get angry with just one word of me.

Therefore, I am the source of all troubles.

186

So, does the source of this trouble really exist or not? Now come to this me, where am I? who I am? From the five aggregates, from the inside and outside of the body, use all kinds of logical reasoning to find, if you can't find it, you will realize emptiness.

However, if you don't look for it according to the right principles, even if you can't find it, it doesn't mean you have realized emptiness.

The so-called righteousness includes nine kinds: negation of the four worlds, reasoning about the origin of the king, negating the origin of the four meanings, reasoning of one difference, reason of diamond shavings, five reasonable reasoning, seven reasonable reasoning, four essential reasoning, and denying existence or not reasoning.

After realizing emptiness, and looking at it again, I no longer have what I imagined before, as if I had a dream.

As the verse said, it is like a dream bubble, which ceases to exist when you wake up from a dream.

So, is there me? The real me does exist, but the me we usually imagine does not exist. It is the false me and the root of the troubles.

What is a false me? For example, when a person becomes the county magistrate, the title "mayor" is settled on this person. When he is removed from the post of the county magistrate, he is no longer the county magistrate. Then, For this person, the title "mayor" is a falsehood.

The real me is the me who is settled on the five aggregates, and the me who exists on the famous words is the me who practiced liberation.

Although this self also includes the five aggregates, the five aggregates alone are not the real self.

187

Illusions are illusions, bubbles are bubbles, and shadows are shadows.

Like a dream bubble, the translation of this sentence is: all things that are composed of karma are illusory, like a dream bubble, and the world should be viewed in this way.

This is a classic expression of Buddhist emptiness, a metaphor for emptiness, and this metaphor includes the entirety of the Diamond Sutra.

Therefore, reciting this verse once will have the merit of reciting the Diamond Sutra, which has a very profound meaning.

This means that when we look at all dharmas, there should be no self-enforcement or law enforcement, and it should be like seeing a dream.

If we have a dream now, we will definitely not be attached to this dream. If someone hits us in the dream, we will not be attached, because we know that it is a dream.

However, if we are beaten in the street, we usually get angry, thinking it was real, that it was real.

Now think about it, if someone slapped me on the street, did it hit me, did it hit me in the body, or did it hit me in the face? Or hit me somewhere else? Think about the me who seemed to be beaten on the street and the me who was beaten in the dream together. If you realize that the feeling is the same, and you will no longer be troubled, at this time, all the concepts and thoughts you have been attached to will be eliminated. Now, once it's broken, looking at the world again is like a different thing from before.

When you reach this level, when you look at ordinary people, you will feel as if ordinary people are crazy, and everyone's troubles are enormous.

188

At this time, I am very happy, I don’t need to ask for anything, and all my actions are natural and not fake.

Now, there is a lot of falsehood in our words and deeds.

However, this kind of natural, ordinary people will feel: "Oh, this person is a bit abnormal".

A wise man will think that it is too fake when looking at ordinary people, and ordinary people will think that it is abnormal when looking at a wise man, because these are two different concepts and views.

Only then can true compassion come out.

When someone is scolded, or someone is angry with us, we can see: Oh, this person is very pitiful, he is angry until he realizes that "people have no ego", and he has so many troubles until he realizes that "law has no ego".

At this time, we can truly express great compassion. The compassion we sent before is not so strong and cannot be expressed. This is the root cause.

The second section is like the dew and the electricity should be done in this way.
Such as dew and electricity should be viewed in this way: These are several metaphors of emptiness in the Diamond Sutra.

Dew is dew, and electricity is lightning.

Dreams, illusions, bubbles, shadows, dew, electricity, there is a little difference between the Tibetan translation and the Chinese translation. The Tibetan version of the Diamond Sutra has nine metaphors.

These six metaphors belong to different levels and can only be explained through nine logics. If they can be really explained, it will be more helpful for understanding emptiness.

189

Those who have not realized emptiness can truly understand emptiness by relying on wisdom to rationally analyze the logic and metaphors of emptiness.

After understanding emptiness, when you practice practice, once you enter emptiness, ego and law will be broken.

Two of my laws are adhered to and one is broken. When I look at all things and myriad laws, it is like a dream, which is completely different from reality, two states.

There are many kinds of illusions.

For example, when a person suffers from severe cholecystitis, the skin turns yellow and the earth looks yellow. The snow-capped mountains are originally white, but the patient sees it as yellow. This is an illusion.

For another example, take a stick to light a fire, and draw a circle around in the air. From a distance, it looks like a fire dragon, but it is not a fire dragon, but just a stick. This is also an illusion.

When I was in the car, the trees on the side of the road seemed to be running backwards. In fact, the trees didn't move. We were moving. This was an illusion.

We now think this is me and that is me, but it's not, it's all illusion.

There are many such instances, and there are countless illusions.

In the classics, it is often said that there are ten larger illusions, and these ten illusions are used to explain this emptiness.

Bubble, bubble bubble, what does it mean? That is to say, like a blister, it disappears all of a sudden.

190

This shows that the me we want to break, in our hearts, has always been an eternal me, but that is not me, I am impermanent.

There is a constant law in the heart, and it is not a law, but an illusion.

Once self-enforcement and Fa-enforcement are broken, the false Fa and I are like blisters, and they are broken in an instant.

The shadow is the shadow, the kind of shadow in the mirror, which is illusory and unreal.

We can often see some magic tricks. When Madhyamika theory reaches a certain level, magicians will be invited to perform magic tricks in the temple.

In the past, many Tibetans performed magic tricks. When graduating from the Madhyamika in the five major treatises, or in the middle of their studies, the masters would invite magicians to perform.

Today's TV is actually the best example of emptiness. It can be said that people on TV can move their eyes, listen to their ears, and talk to their mouths, but they are all just shadows.

It does not mean that all things are empty, so there is no need for cause and effect. The emptiness must conform to the principle of cause and effect. It is precisely because there is cause and effect that all things and all laws can be manifested in the emptiness of nature. null.

191

Chapter Sixteen Madhyamika Verse
Dharma born of karma neither arises nor perishes

Constantly, not often, neither coming nor going

No One and No Distinction

Respecting the subtle Dharma of silence taught by the Buddha

The Madhyamika verse was written by Nagarjuna Bodhisattva. The works written by Nagarjuna Bodhisattva include the six treatises of Nagarjuna, which are all about emptiness.

The Madhyamika verse contains both the content of Nagarjuna's six treatises and the content of the Prajna Sutra. The most fundamental of Nagarjuna's six treatises is "The Great Wisdom", and the first written in the "Great Wisdom" is the Madhyamika verse.

The content of the Madhyamika verse is very deep and very broad. It talks about causal origin and causal law. All dharmas and all things are created by causation and harmony.

192

The first chapter of the law of karma
The law of causation: Buddhism teaches the law of causation. We must talk about causation in everything we do. causation is very important. When causality is separated, things are empty and nothing.

When talking about emptiness, we need to talk about Dependent Origination. Only by combining causes and conditions can something come out. For example, in this Dharma book, what Dependent Origination is combined? Only 152 sheets of paper can be combined to produce such a law book. After tearing off each piece of paper, it will be empty, and this law book will no longer exist.

So, on each piece of paper, does this law book exist? For each page alone, is it the statute book? Or does it all add up to the law? There is a lot of logic to consider on this.

All things, for example, this house too, are the combination of cement, steel bars and many other things to form this building.

Usually, what we see as a real thing is actually a combination of many things.

193

verse 2 neither born nor perished unceasing nor everlasting
neither come nor go

It is neither born nor perished; it is neither permanent nor constant; it does not come nor go nor is it different: Nagarjuna Bodhisattva said in the "Middle Way of the World": It is neither born nor perished, constant and perpetual, neither one nor different, neither coming nor going.

These eight are called the eight dharmas of emptiness, which are birth, extinction, cessation, permanence, oneness, difference, coming, and going.

Why do we talk about emptiness in these eight dharmas? This is because in ancient India in the past, whether it was outsiders, whether there were scriptures or sects within Buddhism, when understanding emptiness, the most incomprehensible aspects were these eight aspects. real law.

Therefore, in order to break the ego-attachment and the law-attachment of sentient beings in these eight dharmas, Nagarjuna Bodhisattva talked about the emptiness of these eight dharmas, and taught the method of breaking the ego-attachment and the dharma-attachment.

First of all, we must understand these eight dharmas. These eight dharmas, Nagarjuna Bodhisattva said, are all non-self-nature and empty.

What does self-nature mean? If there is a Dharma that is always in itself, there is a self-nature, and if there is a birth of a constant, there is a self-nature, but there is no such thing as a permanent birth, because everything is impermanent, and it is not There is eternal constant.

All things are also produced by the combination of various causes and conditions, and there is no one that exists independently.

Self-sufficiency means that it does not depend on dependent origination, and such a thing does not exist, so it is said that there is no permanent existence of freedom.

194

Birth and death. The outsiders believe that birth is real birth, if there is no real birth, there will be no reincarnation; extinction is also real death, without real death, there will be no real extinction.

So, is there life? Life cannot be denied, and the eight dharmas cannot be denied, but what we must deny is the eight dharmas that exist.

There is birth without self-nature, but there is no birth with self-nature and reality.

The same is true of cessation. There is cessation, there is cessation without self-nature, but there is no cessation of real existence and cessation of self-nature.

Neither birth nor death: what is it about? There is no such kind of life and death in our imagination, and there is no such kind of false life and death, but we still do not understand the real life and death.

If you want to understand the real life and death, you must understand the tantra method.

It is generally believed that if you lose your breath, you will die. In fact, you don’t necessarily have to die. Breathing out is a manifestation of death.

There are many meridians in the human body, and there are many qi in it. When dying, these different qi will all merge into the central meridian in the middle of the body, and some qi go up. When this qi merges into the central meridian, the external manifestation It means that a person has died, but he is not actually dead.

After all the qi is integrated into the central meridian, the qi at the upper and lower ends of the central meridian converges in the very middle of the central meridian. Here, in the middle of the white and red bodhi brought by the parents, there is one's own soul, and then, one's own earth, water, fire, The energy of the four elements of the wind is all integrated into the soul from the central channel. At this time, the human body is also cold, and it looks dead on the outside, but it is not dead yet.

Then, the energy of the white and red bodhi brought from the parents broke, and the soul went out from the body and entered the state of the bardo. At this time, the person truly died.

As soon as the white and red bodhi is broken, the red bodhi flows out from the nostrils, and the white bodhi comes out from the secret place. What can be seen from the outside is a nosebleed.

There is no such thing as a false death that we are generally attached to, and that kind of life and death does not exist.

Constant and not constant: Ordinary people who do not understand the reality of all dharmas are either attached to "permanence" or "broken".

Persistence is the attachment to the existence of everything, and it is constant and will not disappear.

In fact, everything changes in an instant, just not necessarily for a short period of time.

For example, the lifespan of a planet may be hundreds or tens of millions of years, and it will eventually explode and disappear. Compared with the universe, it is also an instant.

Therefore, all dharmas and all things, whether sentient or ruthless, are impermanent.

Impermanence means there is no eternity, it is false and unreal, it is only a false appearance of karma and harmony, and it exists temporarily.

Clinging to false things is trouble.

196

There are also people who know impermanence, see that all things and all dharmas will eventually perish, and they cling to "break", thinking that once everything disappears, it will cease to exist.

It is believed that when a person dies, it is like a lamp that goes out. When he dies, he is gone and will not be reborn.

Because of this kind of thinking, live a day, just enjoy, eat, drink and have fun, regardless of cause and effect.

In order to enjoy themselves, they would commit crimes and commit many crimes.

The essence of all things and all dharmas is emptiness, but the effect of cause and effect still exists, that is, ordinary people will receive the retribution, and finally go to hell, and when they come out, they will also be reincarnated in the six realms.

Neither coming nor going: The original face of emptiness is that it is pure and silent, spotless, not standing, coming and going is just an illusion.

Constant, broken, coming and going are all relative, not real. There is no absolute constant, no absolute break, no absolute coming, and no absolute going. For example, people on this side go to the other side, and people on this side For people, it means going, and for people on the other side, it means coming.

Therefore, coming and going are not absolute, so don't be attached.

No one is no different: one means the eternal one, and different means many.

No matter how small things can be divided into the ten directions, all dharmas have their share, so there is no one that is truly eternal and cannot be divided again; all dharmas can be combined according to karma, so there is no eternal difference.

197

In the meditation of emptiness, the Bodhisattva cannot see arising and passing away, constant cessation, coming and going, and one difference, because the eight dharmas are all mundane truths.

Bodhisattvas who have realized emptiness can only see the eight dharmas after they emerge from concentration, because although the eight dharmas have no self-nature, they still exist.

Moreover, what the Bodhisattva sees after he emerges from meditation is the real myriad things and myriad laws, not the fake myriad things and myriad laws. Therefore, for the Bodhisattva, what he is facing is not the external environment that causes troubles.

Ordinary people will always be attached and troubled because all they see are false appearances.

According to the Buddhist point of view, arising and passing away, constant cessation, coming and going, and one difference are all relative, not real, and have no self-nature.

These few words and the Heart Sutra say neither impure nor pure, neither increase nor decrease, they are all about the truth of the Middle Way.

We are still ordinary people, and we don’t understand anything. All we see and hear are fake things, and we think fake things are real.

The third section on the cessation of all dramas
Extinguishing all dramas: The eight real dharmas, the eight dharmas with self-nature, are dramas.

When you realize emptiness in a quantitative way, in the meditation of emptiness, all things and all dharmas have no self-nature.

198

From the point of view of ordinary people, the dramas to be extinguished are the eight real dharmas. Birth, extinction, cessation, constant, coming, going, one, and different are a kind of game in our heart. We are because of this. worry about eight things.

Ordinary people think that all dharmas are false appearances. When they understand that false things are false, they become enlightened.

The root of our inability to liberate is to take what is false as real.

In the concentration of emptiness, the false appearance can be broken.

Once it is broken, nothing can be seen in the concentration, not even the real thing. This is the real concentration of emptiness.

In meditation, you can see things, and only Buddhas can do things. Bodhisattvas who have realized emptiness cannot see arising and passing away, perpetual cessation, coming and going, and one difference.

This tells us that if someone says that they have realized emptiness, entered emptiness, and see something in emptiness, they know that this is not emptiness, and they haven’t really entered emptiness.

The power of emptiness is very great. Once you enter emptiness, the ability of this meditation can suppress all the things of the mundane truth, and the usual troubles and so on are all gone. The consciousness of the eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, and mind are all gone, and there is only emptiness in concentration. If there are other things, it is not emptiness.

199

To reach this level is the merit and virtue that only Bodhisattvas have when they have seen the Way. Generally speaking, this is not the case.

After awakening, all you can see is the true face of everything, and after realizing the true face of all things, all these shackles are now broken.

The fourth section pays homage to the Buddha and says the subtle method of silence
Respect for the subtle Dharma of tranquility taught by the Buddha: Paying homage to the eighty-four thousand Dharma doors taught by the Buddha, the subtle Dharma of tranquility, the subtle Dharma is the Dharma of Prajna, and tranquility is the fruition of the Buddha.

The merit of reciting the Madhyamika verse once is equivalent to the merit of reciting the Six Treatises of Nagarjuna once.

If we truly understand the Madhyamika verse, we will roughly understand the Prajna Sutra, and we will have a certain understanding of the Buddhadharma.

These few words of the Madhyamika verse are the true meaning of Madhyamika, the essence of the Prajna Sutra. If you can fully understand it, and apply it in your daily life, you will be able to do everything smoothly, be free and unhindered, and be very happy.

Chapter 17 Prajna Verse
Let all the voices hear and know the silence leading to the true annihilation

Let all the benefits, the sentient beings, the Tao and the wisdom become the benefits of the world

Possessing all kinds of wisdom, the Buddha said all kinds of dharmas

Shravaka Bodhisattva saluted before all the Buddha-Mothers

The prajna verse is spoken by Maitreya Bodhisattva, and it is at the very front of the "On the Majesty of the Present View".

The prajna verse includes all the hidden meanings of the prajna sutra. The first is to praise prajna. The great prajna, the mother of the Buddha, makes the Shravaka Arhat who seeks the liberation of annihilation lead into true annihilation, which is to become a Buddha.

He also ordered the Bodhisattva, who wants to benefit sentient beings, to rely on the ever-increasing wisdom of cultivating the Way to achieve worldly benefits.

The Madhyamika verse mainly talks about the explicit meaning of the Prajna Sutra, while the Prajna verse talks about the hidden meaning of the Prajna Sutra.

The explicit meaning of the Prajna Sutra is about emptiness, and the hidden meaning is about the order of the ways. These eight lines completely explain the content of the three vehicles and five ways in the Prajna Sutra, which are the five ways of sravaka, the five ways of predestination, and the five ways of Mahayana. road.

201

The first stanza asks all the voice-hearers to be omniscient and lead to true silence
Let the sage-hearers seek silence and annihilation: the sage-hearers are the arhats of the sage-hearers, and the cessation is the elimination of suffering and afflictions.

The various voice-hearers are all the voice-hearers of the five realms, and they also speak of the five realms of voice-hearers.

The hidden meaning here is to talk about the Five Paths of Predestination, because the Arhats of Predestination also pursue annihilation.

Shravakas include the Way of Accumulation, the Way of Enrichment, the Way of Seeing, the Way of Cultivation, and those who have not cultivated the Way. When they are not cultivating the Way, they have already been liberated, and the same is true of predestination.

Omniscient leads to true annihilation: Omniscient refers to Tao wisdom; Buddha's wisdom is called Omniscient, not Omniscient.

Buddha's Nirvana and great liberation require long-term practice. Therefore, the introduction of omniscience includes the omniscience of bodhisattvas, the omniscience of conditioned awareness, etc. Here we are talking about the omniscient knowledge of the sravaka, which is commonly referred to as the basic, The path in the path and the fruit includes the five paths of the voice hearers and the five paths of predestined perception. Through the practice of the five paths, the sage hearers and the five paths of predestination can obtain the fruit of cessation.

The above two sentences are about the liberation of Theravada and the five realms.

202

The second section makes all the benefits, the sentient beings, the Tao and the wisdom become the benefits of the world
To benefit all sentient beings: This is about the Bodhisattva Way, and the practice of the Bodhisattva Way will benefit all sentient beings, that is, help all sentient beings, and cultivate for the sake of saving sentient beings.

Dao and wisdom become the benefit of the world: practicing the bodhisattva way and the bodhisattva's wisdom can benefit all sentient beings.

These two sentences are about the Mahayana bodhisattva way.

The Way of Resource: The way of accumulating food and blessings is called the Way of Resource.

Jiaxingdao: The way to enter the road of seeing is called the Jiaxingdao.

The Way of Seeing: The first way to realize emptiness is called the Way of Seeing.

Cultivation: Continuing to cultivate the Tao of emptiness is called Taoism.

Non-cultivation Dao: The afflictions that should be cut off are all cut off, and there is no need to study in cutting off the afflictions.

The above five are the five paths, which are further divided into the five paths of sravaka, the five paths of prejudice, and the path of bodhisattvas.

Shravaka is a type of Theravada.

Hearing the Mahayana Dharma in front of the Buddha, but not cultivating it himself, write it down, and teach it to those who practise the Mahayana Dharma in a complete and complete manner. Such practitioners are called Shravaka.

The five paths of the voice-hearers are: the path of the voice-hearers, the path of the voice-hearers, the path of the voice-hearers, the path of the voice-hearers, the path of the voice-hearers, and the path of the voice-hearers.

The Way of the Shravaka: The Way of Accumulating Blessings for Liberation.

203

Shravakayakata: In order to clearly understand that there is no ego in man, prepare to enter the Tao of seeing.

Shravaka: I have clearly understood that there is no ego in man.

Shravaka: Continue to cultivate the way of being without self.

Shravaka has no way of practicing: the way of cutting off all afflictions.

The Five Paths of Predestination and the Five Paths of Shravaka are somewhat different during Taoism.

The Path of Fateful Judgment: The Path of Fateful Judgment to accumulate blessings for liberation.

The Path of Predestination and Enlightenment: The main thing to cultivate is that people have no ego and the law has no ego.

Human being without self and Dharma without self are divided into two types: separation and co-occurrence. The antidote of separation and law enforcement is gross emptiness, the antidote of innate law enforcement is subdivided emptiness, and predestined Arhats are only Able to realize the gross emptiness.

Predestined Awakening to see the Tao: The Tao of the gross separation of emptiness has been seen.

Predestined Cultivation Dao: Continue to cultivate gross separation of emptiness, and realize the Dao of human beings without self.

Predestined Awakening No Cultivation of the Dao: Breaking the Dao of coarse discrimination and adherence to the Dharma.

The practice of the Bodhisattva's five realms is more complete than the five realms of voice-hearers and the five realms of predestination, and the fruition status is also more extraordinary.

The way of bodhisattva resources: the way of accumulating blessings in order to become a Buddha.

The Bodhisattva's Path of Addition: In order to enter the Way of Seeing and fully realize emptiness, one must first enter the Path of Addition and practice.

The Bodhisattva sees the Tao: The present has realized emptiness.

204

Bodhisattva practice: continue the path of emptiness.

Mahayana does not practice the Dao: that is to become a Buddha.

This is just a general introduction. For a detailed explanation of the three times and five ways, please refer to "The Treasures of the Sea of ​​the Fa" 5.

The third stanza is the Buddha of All Kinds of Wisdom, saying that all kinds of Dharma are the Buddha of All Kinds of Wisdom: Here we talk about the fruit status of the Buddha.

Among the five Mahayana paths, after the Bodhisattva has completed the first four paths, he enters the last path, the Mahayana path of non-cultivation.

When the Mahayana does not cultivate the Dao, it is the Buddha who possesses all kinds of wisdom, obtains the supreme wisdom of the Buddha, and obtains all knowledge.

Speaking of all these various dharmas: cultivating the Bodhisattva Way, and gaining all knowledge, that is, after becoming a Buddha, you can turn the wheel of Dharma and preach 84,000 dharma doors.

What you need to know here is that you must become a Buddha before you can turn the Falun.

When a bodhisattva preaches the Dharma, it is not called turning the wheel of the Dharma. It can only be called teaching the scriptures and teaching the scriptures. When an arahant preaches the scriptures, it is also teaching the scriptures and teaching the scriptures.

Generally speaking, when lecturing sutras, from the perspective of a disciple, the guru is regarded as a Buddha. At this time, it is okay to say "please turn the wheel of law", but it is not turning the wheel of law in the true sense. Only the Buddha can really turn the wheel of law. .

205

Turning the Falun is different from teaching the scriptures. Teaching the scriptures may not necessarily benefit all sentient beings 100%, but turning the Falun will definitely benefit all sentient beings 100%.

The fourth section of the Shravaka Bodhisattva pays respect before all the Buddha's mothers
The multitude of Shravakas and Bodhisattvas bowed in respect before all the Buddha-Mothers: This is where the voice-hearers, the Enlightened Ones, the Bodhisattvas, and even the Buddhas all come from? They all come from the Buddha's mother, and the Buddha's mother is the Prajna Sutra.

The Shravaka Arahants are cultivated according to the Prajna Sutra, the Marginal Judgment Arahants are cultivated according to the Prajna Sutra, the Bodhisattva status is also cultivated according to the Prajna Sutra, and even the Buddhahood is cultivated through the Prajna Sutra.

Therefore, the Prajna Sutra is the mother of the three vehicles, and the three vehicles must be accomplished according to the Prajna Sutra.

Because the Mahayana Prajna Sutra consists of seventeen parts of Prajna mother and son, and contains many sutras, in the Theravada Sutra, the one that guides Arahants to realize and realize emptiness also belongs to the Prajna method. Therefore, it is said here: All the Buddha mothers pay respects before them.

206

Chapter 18 Dharmakaya Verse
Exterminate false nets, spread the radiance of universal wisdom, pay homage to the wonderful Dharma body

The Dharmakaya verse was written by the Dharma-recognized commentator, and it is a verse in praise of the Buddha Sakyamuni in the "Sakyamuni" written by the Dharma-recognized teacher. The "Sakyamuni" is the first of the five major treatises of Tibetan Buddhism. This section is a summary of the Buddha's first turning of the Dharma Wheel of the Four Noble Truths.

These four sentences contain the whole content of "The Theory of Explanation", which is relatively deep.

Section 1 Destroying the Wandering Nets
Eliminate the false nets: The false nets are the obstacles of affliction and knowledge. After eliminating the obstacles of affliction and knowledge, what is really obtained is the self-nature body of the four bodies of the Buddha.

207

What is the self-nature body of a Buddha? I, or Putkaro I, and the ultimate emptiness of all dharmas, that is, the most complete emptiness of people without self and dharmas without self, is the self-nature body of the Buddha.

The self-nature body has five characteristics and five merits. The five characteristics are: inaction, non-distinction, permanent cessation of the two sides, liberation of the three obstacles, and self-nature light.

The five qualities are: immeasurable, innumerable, inconceivable, incomparable, and free from defilement.

Self-nature means emptiness, and self-nature body is a state of Buddha's great enlightenment. At this time, it is true liberation, great liberation.

The liberation of an arahant is only the liberation of breaking the afflictions, and the liberation of the Buddha is the liberation of breaking the afflictions and the obstacles of knowledge. To break the two obstacles, one must realize the emptiness. Therefore, here it is said to "eliminate false nets".

This sentence also talks about how the two obscurations are eliminated. When you see the Way, you can eliminate the obstacles of discrimination and knowledge; when you cultivate the Way, you can eliminate the obstacles of both afflictions and knowledge.

Why is the trouble barrier called the net? We cannot escape in the cycle of six realms, just like there is an invisible big net that tightly traps all living beings in the six realms in the cycle of reincarnation, so it is called a net.

Why is the knowledge barrier also called the net? Reincarnation is divided into coarse reincarnation and fine reincarnation, and the coarse reincarnation is usually the reincarnation of the six realms;

208

The finer samsara is the samsara in which bodhisattvas below ten levels have not yet escaped.

The fine cycle of samsara is also a net, and all the bodhisattvas below ten levels are trapped in this fine net.

To get rid of this false net, the most important thing is to get rid of afflictions.

Simply put, the hindrances of knowledge are the subtle habits of the hindrances of defilements.

If you want to break the barrier of knowledge, the antidote is dharma without self and emptiness. Once you understand dharma without self and realize emptiness, the barrier of knowledge will be broken.

The second chapter is very deep and broad
Very deep and vast body: The very deep body refers to the Buddha's retribution body, and the vast body refers to the Buddha's incarnation.

Once the obstacles of innate afflictions and obstacles of innate knowledge are eliminated, not only will one obtain the Buddha's own nature body, but also the profound and vast body, that is, the Buddha's retribution body and incarnation.

Why is the self-reporting called deep? Because ordinary people cannot see the sambhogakaya, nor can they hear the sutras preached by the sambhogakaya, only Bodhisattvas can do it.

For us ordinary beings, the Sambhogakaya is inconceivable, so it is called profound.

Sambhogakaya has five characteristics.

209

First, the appearance is always thirty-two, eighty, and solemn, very solemn.

Second, only the Mahayana Dharma is taught, not the Hinayana.

Third, the family members are only Bodhisattvas who have landed on the ground, and there are no ordinary living beings.

Fourth, the residence is only in the Pure Land, not in the Saha world.

Fifth, life is eternal, free from birth, old age, sickness and death.

What does the vast body mean? It refers to the Buddha's report

The various incarnations of the incarnation, because the degree of incarnation of incarnations is infinite, there are many incarnations, and for ordinary people it is a vast body.

Whether they are monks, Bodhisattvas, Theravada Arhats, ordinary people, or other sentient beings of the six realms, they can all learn the Dharma and receive his teachings in front of various incarnations of the Buddha.

Avatars also have five characteristics.

First, the degree of transformation is very wide. What kind of incarnation is required for the karma of sentient beings, and the incarnation can be transformed into that kind of incarnation, and it can be transformed into various sentient beings in the six realms.

In order to save people, he will transform into a human being; to save animals, he will transform into an animal; to save living beings in hell, he will transform into living beings in hell.

The image of the Sambhogakaya only has thirty-two and eighty-sounding appearances, and there is no image of sentient beings in the six realms.

Second, the content of the teaching is very wide. The incarnation not only talks about Mahayana Buddhism, but also talks about Theravada Buddhism and esoteric teaching.

Third, the family members are very wide, including Bodhisattvas, Arahants, and ordinary people.

210

Fourth, the dwelling place is also vast, the Pure Land, the Saha World, and the Three Realms have them, and they are everywhere.

Fifth, the life span is relatively limited. The life span can range from 10,000 years to 1,000 years, or 100 or 10 years, depending on the blessings of all sentient beings.

When the incarnation of Maitreya Buddha came out, it is said in the scriptures that he would live for 80,000 years; the Buddha of Burning Lamp lived for 60,000 years, and Buddha Shakyamuni died at the age of 81, and his lifespan was not certain.

Sometimes it also shows impermanence, for example, according to the needs of sentient beings, it can live for a long time without limitation.

There are also those who were born today and died the next day; there are even those who were born that day and died that day.

The Shakyamuni Buddha we usually say refers to the incarnation of Sakyamuni Buddha. It is to save the sentient beings in the southern Zhanbu continent. From the incarnation of Sambha to Prince Siddhartha, passing away means that the incarnation is taken back by Sambha, it is not ordinary considered dead.

A very deep and vast body, this body refers to a body. Among the four bodies of a Buddha, only the Sambhogakaya and the incarnation body have bodies.

211

The third section is full of Puxianguang
Universally radiating the light of universal sage: universal sage is the whole of the Buddha, and light is the merits of the Buddha's career. It is universal, and it talks about the power of the Buddha to save and transform sentient beings. Among the living beings in the six realms, without missing a single sentient being, all sentient beings are saved.

The content of this sentence is very broad, and it talks about the twenty-seven career merits of the Buddha. These career merits are called Puxianguang.

The twenty-seven kinds of Buddha's undertakings are: Settle down the karma, set up the succession and maturity of others, and set up the four things, set up the knowledge and choice, the above are set up the three sets of karma; set up the realization of the true righteousness, set up the six degrees of perfect karma, set the stage two Righteous conduct, settling in right view, the above are the four ways of adding and practicing; settling knowing that emptiness appears before, this is the one settling of the way of seeing; settling and practising morality, settling forbearance, settling in the knowledge of Bodhisattva-like qualities, settling and knowing the wisdom of the Four Noble Truths , Peaceful knowledge of dependent arising wisdom, Peaceful knowledge of all sexual maturity, Peaceful knowledge of the three realms of wisdom, Peaceful fixation of the true meaning of disobedience and attachment, Peaceful attainment of the famous sayings of the Three Jewels Bodhi, Peaceful attainment of the Buddha's land purity, Peaceful attainment of the Hinayana decision to become a Buddha, Peaceful attainment of the supreme merits, Peaceful fixation The branches of Bodhi, the stability of the karma without being lost, the knowledge of the true truth, the completeness of inversions, the rootlessness of slander, the purity and perfection, the equality of the world and the world, the above are the eighteen karmas for the cultivation of the path; Anritsu.

There are a total of twenty-seven kinds of Buddhist karma, which can be summarized into three main types:

212

First, if sentient beings do not have the seeds of liberation and become Buddhas, or have no predestined relationship, plant a seed in their hearts.

Second, for those who have seeds, let their seeds sprout, let them enter Buddhism, develop bodhicitta, emancipate eccentricity, and cultivate the six prajnaparamitas.

Third, if the seed sprouts, it will be transformed to become a Buddha and liberated, and obtain the fruit status of a Buddha.

There are also many different methods of salvation: the real salvation is to help sentient beings to cut off their afflictions, not to suppress them.

Ordinary salvation, such as the conversion of sentient beings from the three evil realms to the good realm, is also considered a type of salvation.

Specifically, it is to save sentient beings in the hell and other evil realms into the human world. Once they arrive in the human world, they can't give up, follow them all the time, and plant good roots in their hearts.

Once the roots of goodness mature, they enter the Tao.

The first is the way of sustenance, then encourage him, teach him sutras and teachings, let him join the way of practice, and then help him enter the way of view, and then help him become a bodhisattva in one place, two places, and ten places, and after reaching the tenth place, And help him become a Buddha.

After becoming a Buddha, this task is completed.

Buddhas and Bodhisattvas are so compassionate.

A person who is truly related to the Buddha is sick. If he has healthy seeds, the Buddha can help him to be healthy; if he does not have healthy seeds, the Buddha will plant healthy seeds for him. Seeds of wealth, or seeds of wisdom, etc.

213

The Buddha can save all sentient beings in the six realms who have a predestined relationship with him in one fell swoop.

However, the Buddhadharma is boundless, and it is very difficult to save people who have no predestined relationship at all. It is necessary to wait for the predestined relationship to mature.

When the fate is there, the fate is mature, and the Buddha and Bodhisattvas will come again, and there will be no delay for a minute or a second, and they will immediately come and transform.

A brother of Ksitigarbha King Bodhisattva in his previous life went to hell a long time ago. His brother was not a Buddhist. Ksitigarbha King Bodhisattva wanted to save him in hell, so he waited for his fate and stayed for hundreds of years. For a kalpa, first plant a seed for him, wait for hundreds of kalpas, wait for the seed to mature, and finally save it.

Dehua has to wait for fate. When fate arrives, there will be no delay. If fate is not there, there is no way.

Section 4 Salute to the Wonderful Dharma Body
Paying homage to the wonderful Dharmakaya: It means paying homage to the very excellent Dharmakaya.

These four verses describe the four bodies of the Buddha: the body of self-nature, the body of retribution, the body of incarnation, and the body of law.

The supreme wisdom of the Buddha is the Dharma body of the Buddha, all the knowledge of the Buddha.

Why only pay homage to the Buddha's Dharma body? Because only the Buddha's Dharma body can save sentient beings, only the Buddha's wisdom can save sentient beings, and only with all knowledge can the Dharma wheel be turned.

214

The whole meaning of these four verses is a process of becoming a Buddha.

To become a Buddha, you must first break the two obstacles, and when you become a Buddha, you will gain the four bodies.

The four bodies of the Buddha have the twenty-seven business merits of the Buddha, and the blessings of the Buddha's business.

Master Liuba Gele went to the Jokhang Temple in Tibet to pay homage to Shakyamuni Buddha. He was always beside the Buddha Shakyamuni statue, looking right and left. At this time, the Buddha opened his mouth and said with a smile: "I am Shakyamuni Buddha.

So he bowed three times and said, "In the beginning, you were like me. You went around in the six realms, and you went to hell many times. When you were a human being, you were even worse than me. You were also a beggar. Later, you met a master, If you follow the master to study, and study bravely and diligently without retreating, you will become a Buddha, and I am still an ordinary person. Now, please accept my obeisance.

It is difficult to say that becoming a Buddha is difficult, and it is easy to say that it is very simple. The main thing is to see if you can find a way to become a Buddha, whether you believe in this method or not, and whether you should follow this method.

Master Tsongkhapa's method of combining the explicit and secret is completely complete. Zhangjia Rinpoche once said: It is a pity that I do not have a disciple like Venerable Milarepa. If I have such a disciple, I can also be a Marr. A teacher like Master Ba.

In the teachings of Master Marpa, Venerable Milarepa practiced for more than 20 years before becoming a Buddha.

Zhangjia Living Buddha said: If he listens to my teachings, such a diligent person can become a Buddha in three years.

215

Master Dongzheriba was a master who specialized in cultivating the Mima (the prayer of Master Tsongkhapa). After he achieved achievement, he often taught scriptures and taught the Dharma. Sometimes when he could not offer him a throne, he often took a long A stick with a pointy top.

He inserted the stick into the ground, meditated on the top of the stick, and lectured on the scriptures.

When the master lectures on the sutras, he often says: You people, you should let the horn of the Dharma King Yama hold you and tell you to learn. If you don’t learn, you will go to hell and suffer in the future. I can only go to hell to save you. Really Tired me.

Each of us can become a Buddha.

If you want to become a Buddha, you can become a Buddha, and if you want to be liberated, you can be liberated.

There are ways to become Buddhas, there are ways to liberate, and there are ways to be reborn in the Pure Land, and there are all kinds of ways.

Whether or not you can succeed mainly depends on yourself and whether you are diligent.

If you don't look at the master, the master can only teach and pass on the method to you. For example, if there is an obstacle, the master will pass on the method to break the obstacle. If you do it, you will definitely succeed. If you can't do it, the master can't do anything about it.

No one will pull your hands and feet and throw you on the Pure Land, that is impossible.

If this were possible, Buddha Shakyamuni's great compassion would have thrown us all into the Pure Land long ago.

To save yourself, to save yourself.

Once you have a master, you have an inheritance, and you have a method, you can only rely on yourself for the rest.

Introduction to Awa Temple

Awa Temple, whose full Tibetan name is "Awa Zhaxi Jiangqulin", which means "Awa auspicious Bodhi Island", is located in Dunchan, about 5 kilometers west of Angla Township, Jianzha County, Hainan Prefecture, Qinghai Province.

In the 15th century, Awa Monastery was built by Master Dorje Sampo, a great Sakya sect master from Aba, Sichuan.

Master Dorje Sampo is a great siddhi who has completed his study, meditation, and practice, and holds sacred relics such as the Lotus Hevajra Buddha and Naropa Deity Aquarius handed down from Sakya Phagpa.

He led craftsmen and monks and lay believers to carve the famous Qianjie Thousand Buddhas in Awa Temple. Some of the stone carvings of the thousand Buddhas were completed by Master Dorje Sampo himself.

In 1583, the third Dalai Lama came to Qinghai at the invitation of King Anda Khan.

Believers from all the tribes came to worship the third Dalai Lama. The Dalai Lama, in response to the strong prayers of the majority of believers, preached the Dharma in Qinghai for three years.

When the Dalai Lama was about to return to Lhasa, the leaders of the Mongolian tribes in Qinghai jointly asked him to go to Qinghai to preach the Dharma again, or to send a disciple with the same level of achievement to Qinghai.

228

Later, the third Dalai Lama sent his disciple, Lamu Tso Ni Gyatso, to Qinghai. La Mu Tso Ni Gyatso was worshipped as a guru by believers of twenty-four tribes.

The leader of the Mongolian Tumut tribe, Huoluo Chinan, offered the Awa Temple to Lamu Tso Ni Gyatso as his residence in Xi.

From then on, the I Lamu Living Buddha lived in this temple to spread the Dharma, and was later conferred as the White Buddha by Ming Guangzong (Zhu Changluo).

Around 1619, Zangren Qujie Gedun Gyaltsen presided over the Awa Monastery. He taught the "Guangdong Theory on the Stages of the Bodhi Path" and established the School of Debating Sutras.

This marks the conversion of Awa Monastery from the Sakya sect to the Gelug sect.

At that time, there were more than 600 resident monks in Awa Monastery, and many Geshes with both virtue and talent were trained.

Later, Awa Gexi Moran Tashi presided over the Awa Temple, and established the sangha system and the monk's study system.

Subsequent chairpersons have supplemented and improved the monastery’s infrastructure and learning system, including the sutra teachers Sangye Gyatso, Norsang Gyatso Gelehuadan, the great siddhisattva Nige Lobsang Dongzhi, Shamai Rinpoche Ngawang Tenzin Gyatso, Duo Guru, Mo Guru, Chewa Rinpoche, Yuxiong Rinpoche II and III, Gangcha Guru, etc.

During the Cultural Revolution, the Awa Temple suffered devastating damage, but precious statues of Buddhas such as the Thousand Buddhas of Xianjie, the Thousand Buddhas of Longevity and the Six-armed Mahakala have been preserved intact.

The six-armed Mahakala in Awa Temple is a Buddha statue that descended from the sky. When Ramutso Ni Gyatso passed through the Himalayas of Qinghai Lake, various auspicious elephants descended from the sky, and the six-armed Mahakala appeared from the sky. pull.

229

The master brought this image back to Awa Temple and worshipped it for a long time.

In the 1980s, several old lamas and local believers rebuilt the Awa Temple.

In 2001, with the initiation of Dharma King Yongzeng and the support of Gangcha Rinpoche, Awa Temple was relocated to its current address, Dunchan.

Dunchan means the special place where the forty-five empowerment of the vajra man is achieved, and it is the holy place for the great achievers of all dynasties to practice and achieve.

It used to be masters such as the 2nd Gyalmu-like Shepa (Jimei Wangpo) who presided over the Labrang Monastery by Master Nan Gyatso of Dongkosuo, the living Buddha of Yuxionggeng Deng Dazhi, and the 14th Gysang Kimba who presided over the Longwu Monastery. They, as well as places where monks from monasteries such as Xiaqiong Monastery and Deqin Monastery impart Vajra Mandala empowerment.

The great siddhis of Dunchan include the Second Segyal Mu-like Shepa (Jimei Wangpo), Yijung Dundazhi, Awaqieji, Shamai Rinpoche, Are Rinpoche and so on.

Rako Rinpoche once said that Dunchan is a golden plate from which many great siddhas have emerged.

In 2012, the monks and laymen of Awa Temple invited Ngawang Gyatso Vajra Guru to Awa Temple, and entrusted the temple to Ngawang Gyatso Vajra Guru.

Guru Ngawang Gyatso Vajrapani created the Mahavira Hall of Awa Monastery, revitalizing the system of monks and monks.

Now, the main hall of the Awa Temple has been completed, and the Zunsheng Building was capped in April 2018, and the facilities in all aspects are constantly being improved.

230

I believe that under the guidance of Ngawang Gyatso Vajra Guru, Awa Monastery will live in Dharma for a long time and become more prosperous!

Under the support of the believers in the ten directions, in the near future, the Tuola Temple and the Awa Temple will be presented to the believers in the ten directions with a brand-new appearance.

May all sentient beings be freed from the sea of ​​misery and be safe forever!
