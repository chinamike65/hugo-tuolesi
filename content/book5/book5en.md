#### Introduction to Ngawang Gyatso Vajra Guru

Master Ngawang Gyatso was born on March 3, 1969 (the fifteenth day of the first lunar month) in Hainan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Qinghai Province.

The master began to practice Buddhism as a novice monk at the age of six, and became an ordained monk at the age of eighteen. He studied with Dharma Master Lama Yong Zeng, Geshe Rinpoche, Lobsang Dorje Vajra Guru, Gejia Rinpoche, Dharma Master Yeshe Gyatso, Gazang Qusong Vajra Guru and the 10th Panchen Lama.

Master Ah Wang, having followed the precepts of his teachers, received complete transmission of the teachings from his seven masters, the forty-sixth generational heirs of the "Perfection of Wisdom Sutra", the most important classic of Buddhism. From them he obtained more than 200 kinds of empowerments, more than 300 advanced special empowerments, more than 280 guiding precepts, with more than 500 scriptural sutras and more than 80 oral transmissions of intangible secrets. Therefore, the lineage of the master's doctrinal transmission is extremely complete and especially rare.

His Holiness Dharma Master Yongzeng, who was once the sutra teacher of the living Buddha, Sechi, in Lamodeqin Monastery was a person of superior virtue and the complete holder of the transmissions of the Gelugpa tantric teachings. Master Ah Wang studied with Master Yongzeng for more than 20 years and absorbed all of the wisdom and experience of the Venerable Dharma Master. The other six masters are also highly proficient in the esoteric secrets and have sufficient evidence of exceptional scholarly achievements. 

In addition, Master Ah Wang studied at Qinghai Buddhist College and the Ta'er (Kumbum) Monastery Debating College of Dialectics (Debating College).
With a single-minded commitment to study and wide erudition, he completed the study of sutra and tantra, the five major theories of the five great Dharma masters, well ahead of schedule.

Since graduating from Qinghai Buddhist Academy and Ta'er Monastery Debating Academy with excellent grades, the master has been living at Qinghai Tuole Monastery, serving as the Vajra Guru and the abbot of the monastery. He teaches the monks of Tuole Monastery every day in groups: lectures on the five traditional monastic subjects, the "Three Principal Aspects of the Path", and the four classes of tantra, and has set up a new sutra debating school at the monastery.

Master Ah Wang has now produced several batches of lamas with a Geshe degree (equivalent to a Ph.D. in Buddhism).

The master also insists on going into retreat for two months every year.

Lama Yongzeng once told Master Ah Wang: "Your whole career in this life is to turn the wheel of Dharma widely and spread the Dharma for the benefit of all living beings."

Master Ah Wang often gives sermons, teachings, lectures, and holds empowerment ceremonies in both Tibetan and Chinese areas, and often holds patriotic teachings, and patriotic activities in monasteries, making due contributions to the promotion of social harmony and stable development.

At the invitation of believers from other places, the master has travelled all over the world to teach the sutras and the Dharma to those who are destined to hear them.

In 2009 and 2014, invited by the Buddhist community in Macau, the master, as a representative of Tibetan Buddhist monks, presided over the Puja for the 10th and 15th anniversary of Macau's return to the mainland.

In October 2015, the master was also invited to participate in the 2015 Chongsheng International Forum co-organized by the Yunnan Buddhist Association and the Dali Chongsheng Temple.

Master Ngawang is not only perfect in his practice and perfect in his eloquence, but he is also the author of a rich collection of writings.

The Master's writings include Commentary on Philosophy, Commentary on the Diamond Sutra, Dictation from the Three Masters of the Three Paths and Three Schools, Vajrasattva Ritual and Practice, and Dakini Mother of Buddha Ritual, Tracks and Practical Practices, Practice of Retreat, Simmering Sang Ritual, Biography of Vajra Guru Gazang Qusong, History of Tibetan Buddhism, Dabao Motto, Nectar Dharma Rain, Tantric Buddhism Feng Shui and the "Dharma Ocean Treasures" series (this is the third volume), etc.

The master's writings are concise and comprehensive, and the analysis is profound and thorough, and has been praised and acclaimed by many great scholars in Buddhist circles at home and abroad.

Master Ah Wang once studied under the 10th Panchen Lama, who is deeply loved by the people. The Panchen Lama was called "a great patriot and an outstanding leader of Tibetan Buddhism" by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and made many important contributions to Buddhism in China.

Master Ah Wang was deeply influenced by the Panchen Lama. In his religious thought, he advocated that Buddhist disciples should be concerned with the common people, cherish the "Three Great Loves" and practice the "Four Practices" in order to achieve the harmony and perfection of the "Five Vows".

"Three Loves": patriotism, love for the people, and love for education.

"Four Practices": take self-purification as the foundation, take altruism as the principle, take harmony as the spirit, and take enlightenment as the goal.

"Five Wishes": Great social harmony, great national unity, great national prosperity, great world peace, great perfection in practice.

Under the leadership of Master Ah Wang, the Sangha of Tuole Monastery adheres to the rule of the Gelug School. The results are among the best. Master Ah Wang said that it does not matter if we are talking about Southern Buddhism, Chinese Buddhism or Tibetan Buddhism, they are all Buddha's Dharma, and they are all very special.

Buddhists should go deeper into the scriptures, diligently study and think, and establish a right view. At the same time, it is necessary to develop Bodhicitta widely and truly think for the sake of all sentient beings, in order to achieve a perfect life for oneself and others.

**Prajna-paramita Heart Sutra**

Translated by Xuan Zang, a master of Tang Sanzang


At that time, the Blessed One entered an absorption on categories of phenomena called ‘perception of the profound’. At the same time, noble Avalokiteśvara, the bodhisattva and great being, beheld the practice of the profound perfection of wisdom, and saw that the five aggregates are empty of nature. And all the sufferings of Sariputra are relieved.

Form is emptiness; emptiness is form. Emptiness is not other than form; form is not other than emptiness.


The emptiness of the Dharma does not arise, does not perish, is not defiled, is not pure, does not increase, and does not decrease. Therefore, the sky has no form, no feelings, thoughts, actions, consciousness, no eyes and ears.

No eye, no ear, no nose, no tongue, no body, no mind; no visible form, no sound, no odour, no taste, no texture and no mental objects; there is no eye element up to no mind element and as far as no mental consciousness element; there is no ignorance, no extinction of ignorance up to no old age and death, no extinction of old age and death.

Likewise, there is no suffering, no origin, no cessation and no path, no wisdom, no attainment, and no non-attainment.

Therefore, Śāriputra, since bodhisattvas have no attainment, they rely on and abide by the perfection of wisdom. 

Since their minds are unobscured, they have no fear. They completely transcend error and reach the ultimate nirvāṇa. 

All the buddhas throughout the three times fully awaken to unsurpassed, genuine and complete enlightenment by means of the perfection of wisdom. 

Therefore, the mantra of the perfection of wisdom—the mantra of great insight, the unsurpassed mantra, the mantra that equals the unequalled, the mantra that pacifies all suffering—is not false and should thus be understood as true.

The mantra of the perfection of wisdom is proclaimed as follows:

[oṃ] gate gate pāragate pārasaṃgate bodhi svāhā.

missing

At that time, many Bodhisattvas turned into vultures to listen to sutras, so this mountain was called Vulture Peak; another way of saying that this mountain looks like a vulture, it is called Vulture Peak.

There are other different claims.

We need to know that the Vulture Peak is the place where Shakyamuni taught the Heart Sutra and Prajna Sutra. Vulture Peak has the same blessings as the Bodhi Seat where the Buddha became enlightened.

Buddha Sakyamuni became a Buddha on the fifteenth day of the fourth lunar month when he was thirty-five years old. Nine years after he became a Buddha, on the fifteenth day of the lunar calendar, he taught the Heart Sutra.

When the Buddha taught other sutras, Venerable Ananda came to offer the throne, and then the Buddha sat and taught the sutras.

Only the Prajna Sutra was taught, and Buddha Shakyamuni himself offered the throne and then started the lecture.

Venerable Ananda asked the Buddha: Why did the Buddha offer the throne himself? Buddha Shakyamuni replied: All the Buddhas of the three generations have become Buddhas by virtue of the Prajna Sutra. Arhats rely on the Prajna Sutra to cut off their afflictions.

Cultivators eliminate karmic obstacles, accumulate blessings, cut off afflictions, and cut off knowledge obstacles, all rely on the Prajna Sutra.

It is precisely because the Prajna Sutra has such extraordinary merits that when preaching the sutra, the Buddha would personally offer his throne to show his respect.

Even the Buddha respects the Prajna Sutra, and we ordinary people should do so even more.

I am now sitting on the Dharma seat to teach the scriptures, not to respect myself, but to respect the Prajna Sutra all the time in my heart.

Different Versions of the Second Section of the Heart Sutra
There are seven Chinese translations of the Heart Sutra in existence. The earliest translation of the Heart Sutra from Sanskrit into Chinese was by Master Kumarajiva in 409 AD. Next is the "Heart Sutra" translated by Master Xuan Zang in the Tang Dynasty, as well as the translations of Master Fayue, Master Prajna, Master Wisdom Wheel, Master Facheng, and Master Shihu.

Earlier, there were not only these seven versions but eleven versions in total and four versions have now been lost, including the "Heart Sutra" translated by Master Bukong, one of the three great scholars of Kaiyuan in the Tang Dynasty. In the process of spreading Buddhism, it has gone through a lot of hardships. In particular, the Han region experienced the three martial arts to destroy the Buddha in a week, and the Tibetan region also experienced Langdama eradication of the Buddha in the pre-prosperous period. After Buddhism went through these hardships, many teachings and proofs, as well as classics, were lost.

According to the "Heart Sutra" translated by Master Fayue, when Buddha Shakyamuni taught the "Heart Sutra", among the people who listened to the sutra, there were hundreds of thousands of monks, and there were 77,000 great Bodhisattvas. The Heart Sutra translated by Master Xuan Zang does not have these. We should read all the seven versions carefully, and think carefully about where the Heart Sutra is spoken, who the audience were at that time, how many bodhisattvas, and how many great ones were there. Knowing this, monks, will be of great help in understanding the Heart Sutra, and it will be easier to understand what the Heart Sutra is talking about.

**Section 3 - Meaning of the Heart Sutras**

Different versions of the Heart Sutra have different names. What we are going to talk about today is the Heart Sutra translated by Master Xuan Zang.

Master Xuan Zang was born in Luoyang, Henan Province in 602 AD, passed away in 664 CE. Commonly known as Chen Yi, and became a monk at the age of 13.

Later, he went to India to collect scriptures. It took 17 years in total. When returning to China from India, Master Xuan Zang brought back 150 Buddha relics, 7 Buddha statues, and 657 scriptures. These sutras contain 75 sutras translated by Master Xuan Zang and his disciples, including the Great Prajna Paramita Sutra and the Heart Sutra. 

The "Heart Sutra" we are going to talk about today is Master Xuan Zang's translation, and its full name is "Prajna Paramita Heart Sutra".

"Prajnaparamita" is a literal translation of Sanskrit. "Prajna" means great wisdom, the wisdom of realizing emptiness. "Paramita,"

The most accurate Sanskrit word for it is "Paramita," which means "to reach the other shore." "Prajna Paramita" means that we need to go from this shore of constant samsara and suffering to the other shore of liberation and Buddhahood. If you truly understand the "Heart Sutra" and follow the guidance of the "Heart Sutra", you can realize emptiness, and rely on the wisdom of emptiness to escape samsara. If you combine bodhicitta and practice the six stages of the Bodhisattva Path, you can become a Buddha.

"Heart" includes the fleshly heart, the false heart, and the true heart. 

Our heart is the heart of flesh, the delusional heart is the mind that produces afflictions, and the sincerity is the heart of cultivating the Way. "Heart" in "Heart Sutra" has two meanings, one refers to the true heart, that is, the mind that realizes emptiness. The second refers to the core, which means that the Heart Sutra is the core and essential of the Great Prajna Sutra.

"Jing" has four meanings: penetrating, capturing, constant, and dharma.

"Guang" means running through. All the classics taught by the Buddha can be linked together, and they are all consistent in principle. For example, in the order of the path, the path of the lower, the middle, and the upper stages is the path to becoming a Buddha that is linked together.

"Action" means to guide sentient beings into Buddhism. The 84,000 Dharma Doors preached by the Buddha can cure all the afflictions of sentient beings and lead them to liberation.

"Always" means everlasting. The Buddhadharma is an unchanging truth. The Dharma taught by Buddha Shakyamuni 2,500 years ago, still makes sense now. Even after a few thousand years, there will be no problem, because what the Buddha taught is: The ultimate truth, while the doctrine of emperors or scholars is not necessarily a complete truth, and will change with the the times.

"Dharma" means law. The Buddhadharma is the Dharma that all sentient beings in the ten directions follow. Bodhisattvas must follow the Prajna Sutra to attain the status of Buddhahood, and Arhats must also achieve the status of Arhats according to the Prajna Sutra. The three vehicles of sravakas, pratyekabuddhas, and bodhisattvas can only be achieved by following the Dharma taught in the Prajna Sutra.

##### Chapter 4 - "Heart Sutra"

The Heart Sutra contains a wide range of content and meanings. It can be said that all of the five major treatises of Tibetan Buddhism are the Heart Sutra. The "Theory of Interpretation" is about the logic of the Heart Sutra, the "Theory of Present View and Majesty" is about the order of the path in the Heart Sutra, The Middle Mind is about the emptiness of the explicit meaning of the Heart Sutra, The "Treatise on Evaluation" talks about the number theory in the Heart Sutra, including the number of afflictions, the order of the path, the thirty-seven paths and the six stages, etc. The "Treatise on Precepts" talks about the practice of the Heart Sutra.

The whole "Heart Sutra" talks about "people without self" and "dharma without self", and also includes the eighteen realms, the profound emptiness and eight dharmas, the Four Noble Truths, the Twelve Causal Links of Dependent Origination, and the Three Vehicles. It is a method of combining explicit and secret, so it is divided into explicit, implicit and secret meanings in terms of content.

The explicit meaning of the Heart Sutra refers to the literal meaning and speaks of emptiness. Different schools of Buddhism have different views, and way the "Heart Sutra" is explained is different. The Gelug School of Tibetan Buddhism interprets emptiness according to the viewpoint of the Madhyamika Prasanghika School, and most of Chinese Buddhism is based on the Mind-Only School. There is also a slight difference between the teachings of Sutra and Tantra. The content of the Heart Sutra is the same. Why are there different explanations? This is because the masters have different levels of understanding. Those who have a shallower understanding will speak a little more shallowly, while some masters have a deep understanding and speak more deeply.

The hidden meaning of the Heart Sutra is the stages of the Dharma, which are the five Paths. The five paths are the five paths of the Mahayana, the five paths of the Hinayana, and the five paths of the Shravaka and the five paths of Pratyekabuddhas. There are fifteen paths in total. If this teaching is fully expanded, the entire Three Aspects of the Path will be finished.

The Heart Sutra contains 84,000 teachings. Regarding the hidden meaning of the "Heart Sutra", the masters of Tibetan Buddhism have explained it more satisfactorily, and the masters of the Gelugpa School have explained it excellently.

The esoteric meaning of "Heart Sutra" is about the second class of tantra, which requires a master who is proficient in the four tantras to explain it clearly.

In terms of the method of explanation, it can be explained in broad, medium and short ways. You can briefly talk about the whole Heart Sutra first, and then talk about it in detail and in-depth. Or first the explicit meaning, then the implicit meaning, and finally the secret meaning. We use the latter explanation method, which will be easier to understand.

**Chapter 2 - The Text of the Heart Sutra**

The Heart Sutra was not spoken by Buddha Shakyamuni himself. 

When he taught the Heart Sutra, Buddha Shakyamuni entered deep samadhi and inspired Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva and Shariputra, and Shariputra asked Avalokitesvara: "Are the five aggregates empty? Are all dharmas empty?" Then the Bodhisattva Avalokitesvara replied, unfolding in the form of a question and answer, and this is how the whole sutra begins.

Chapter 1 - Introduction

1. Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva

"Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva"

"View" means to see and observe, and Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva is Guanyin Bodhisattva.

"Bodhisattva" is a literal translation of Sanskrit, and the full name is Bodhisattva.

"Bodhi" translates to "verification", which is the realization of emptiness, and the elimination of suffering.

"Sa" means sattva, which means brave. He is very brave in saving sentient beings. He is a bodhisattva.

Why does everyone worship the Bodhisattva, because the Bodhisattva is very brave in saving sentient beings, he can give himself up for all sentient beings, everything he does is for the sake of all sentient beings, and there is no selfishness at all, so everyone will worship the Bodhisattva.

There is a story in the word "view" of Avalokitesvara.

Before the Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva became a Buddha, he served Amitabha as his teacher, and in front of Amitabha he developed his bodhicitta and vowed:

I will save all sentient beings, and I will become a Buddha. If I have not saved all sentient beings, I will not become a Buddha. The petals are split into a thousand petals.

After making this oath, Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva first saved all beings in the path of hungry ghosts, and he saves many sentient beings in the path of hungry ghosts every day.

Thousands of years later, Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva thought: "The sentient beings in the path of hungry ghosts should be finished. When we go to the top of Mount Sumeru, there are still as many sentient beings in the path of hungry ghosts as before."

Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva was very disappointed, and suddenly had a retreat.

As soon as the bodhicitta retreats, the head is split into ten petals, and the body is split into a thousand petals.

At this time, Amitabha Buddha immediately went to Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva and said, "You have to develop bodhicitta more bravely, and I will bless you to save sentient beings."

The head of Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva split into ten petals, and Amitabha Buddha blessed it to become the ten heads of Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva, and a head of Amitabha Buddha was added on top to form eleven heads.

The body was split into a thousand petals, each one of which was blessed by Amitabha Buddha and formed a hand, and each hand formed an eye. This is the origin of Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva.

The word "guan" means that Guanyin Bodhisattva observes the living beings in the six realms day and night with a thousand eyes of wisdom to see what kind of sufferings they have, what kind of pain they have, and whether there is an opportunity to cut off suffering and karmic obstacles, and eliminate suffering. Has the opportunity come? 

Once the opportunity comes, Guanyin Bodhisattva will immediately come to bless all beings.

"Freedom" means being at ease in body, speech, and mind.

At ease, the body can manifest at will.

Just like the "Puxian Xingxiangpin" said in "one body reappears in the world", this is an inconceivable manifestation of the Buddha's own merits.

A body that can manifest the number of dust particles in a Buddha-field can be transformed into thirty-two appearances, eighty sublime appearances, or ordinary sentient beings. This is something that we ordinary people cannot do.

To speak freely is to speak freely, as it is said in "Puxian Xingyuanpin":

Heavenly Dragon, Yaksha, Kupanta, even human and non-human,

All the speeches of all living beings are spoken with various sounds.

This is the merit of the speech of the Buddha.

The Buddha can understand the language of all sentient beings, and can preach the Dharma sound to all sentient beings without hindrance. All sentient beings hear the language they can understand and the Dharma door they need.

The Buddha can also answer all the questions of sentient beings with one tone at the same time, regardless of the depth of their foundation and wisdom.

The language of tantra is to unravel the Vajra language.

The mind is at ease, which means that the mind is settled. Wherever the mind is, it can be settled where it is.

If your heart is always on Bodhicitta, and you can generate great kindness and compassion for all sentient beings, you will be at ease.

Our ordinary minds are not at ease, and we often think about afflictionsome and painful things involuntarily, and we don’t think about them deliberately, but we cannot control them.

Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva already possesses these three qualities of freedom.

In addition to this, Buddhas and Bodhisattvas have other free qualities.

God becomes free, that is, the supernatural power is free; it can travel freely, and can freely enter and leave the universe and the pure land beyond the world; career is free, doing things can be achieved by one's own will; free at will, what you want is what you want; , including the eight free qualities of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas.

12

Second, a brief description of six degrees "Deep Prajnaparamita"

"Performance" refers to the ten thousand actions of the Bodhisattva, which is the work done by the Bodhisattvas, including the six perfections, that is, the six paramitas.

Paramita is a literal translation of Sanskrit, including the Paramita of Generosity, Paramita of Discipline, Paramita of Patience, Paramita of Diligence, Paramita of Meditation, and the Paramita of Wisdom.

"Deep" - the six paramitas are deep.

Here, when Guanyin Bodhisattva entered the deep prajnaparamita to meditate on emptiness, he talked about emptiness to Sariputra.

Buddhas and Bodhisattvas can realize the nature of emptiness. From the point of view of ordinary people, they find it inconceivable.

"Prajna" means wisdom.

Wisdom is divided into wisdom of emptiness and wisdom of the world, and wisdom of prajna refers to the wisdom of realizing emptiness.

"Paramita" means to the other side.

This sentence means that relying on the wisdom of emptiness to stay away from this shore of the cycle of birth and death, to reach the other shore of liberation, is Prajnaparamita.

The whole sentence "when practicing deep prajna-paramita" refers to the time when Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva practiced and held prajna-paramita deeply with the wisdom and ability of a great bodhisattva, and observed that all five aggregates are empty, and all things are empty.

3. The five aggregates without self-nature

"Seeing that the Five Aggregates Are Empty"

"Seeing" is the meaning of present realization.

"The five aggregates are empty." The five aggregates are form, feeling, thought, action, and consciousness.

The five aggregates are all empty, according to the meaning of the word, the five aggregates are empty.

According to the understanding of ordinary people, emptiness means nothing, and does the five aggregates be empty mean that there are no five aggregates?

No, it means that the self-nature of the five aggregates is empty, which means that the five aggregates have no self-nature, but it does not mean that the five aggregates do not exist.

The "emptiness" that we often talk about can be divided into the following types: emptiness that never existed before, bad emptiness, extreme emptiness, mutual emptiness, and self-nature emptiness.

What is emptiness that never existed before?

For example, in a glass of milk, when it is milk, there is no yogurt. This situation is called emptiness that did not exist before.

Bad emptiness refers to the emptiness formed by the change of things. For example, when it is yogurt, it means that the milk has been broken. At this time, for milk, it is called bad emptiness.

Extreme emptiness means that there is no physical existence, such as a bottle, where there is no bulge, it is the extreme emptiness of the bottle.

14

Mutual emptiness means mutual non-existence. For example, there are no sheep in cattle.

The self-nature of emptiness mentioned here refers to the emptiness that is always at ease, just like the person in the mirror. Although it is not a real person and has no real self, it can actually appear.

Self-nature means always at ease.

What does "always, one, and at ease" mean?

Taking form as an example, everything the eye sees belongs to form, let's see if the "form" of form has its own nature.

For example, if you see a teacup, does this teacup have a self-nature?

If there is a self-nature, it must be always at ease.

"Chang" means constant, forever, if this teacup is "permanent", it will never become old or damaged.

However, we all know that this is impossible, so teacups are not "normal".

Let's see if this teacup is "one", "one" means no other ingredients.

But the teacup is composed of the elements of earth, water, fire and wind.

If there is no land, it will not be so strong, and it will not be hard; if there is no wind, it will not be able to be held. Lightness is the attribute of wind.

So, this teacup is not "one".

The teacup is not "comfortable" and needs to rely on other factors to exist.

If this teacup is free, it should not depend on anything to exist, but in fact, we all know that the teacup depends on many things to exist, so the teacup is not free.

That is to say, there is no such thing as ever-in-itself, and all things depend on you and me, and I depend on you, and exist in an interdependent relationship.

The teacup is not always free, it has no self-nature, the form aggregate has no self-nature, not only the form aggregate, the five aggregates have no self-nature, and they are empty without self-nature, so the five aggregates are empty.

Emptiness is difficult to understand.

When talking about emptiness, it is difficult for the master who teaches the Dharma to express it, and it is also difficult for the disciple to understand.

Venerable Milarepa truly realized emptiness, and even so, when speaking of emptiness, it was difficult for him to express it.

When others heard him talk about emptiness, they felt that what he said seemed crazy.

There is something that clearly exists, but he says that there is no such thing. Everyone is thinking, what is the Venerable talking about? Can't understand.

Guru Rinpoche also realized emptiness. When he talked about emptiness, everyone felt that Guru Rinpoche said that nothing exists, the Dharma does not exist, the Buddha does not exist, and the Sangha does not exist.

Everyone thought, since nothing exists, why should we practice?

When Nagarjuna Bodhisattva talked about the Dharma door of emptiness, the dharma master who held views other than Madhyamika and Mind-only read Nagarjuna's Six Treatises and believed that Nagarjuna Bodhisattva was a person with wrong views.

Because they believed that Nagarjuna said that Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha do not exist, so they criticised Nagarjuna: You are an outsider with wrong views, not a disciple of the Buddha.

4. Power of the Heart Sutra


"Overcoming All Misery"

This is talking about the merits of the Heart Sutra.

The Tibetan version of the Heart Sutra does not contain this verse, and some of the seven existing versions of the Heart Sutra do not have this verse either. There are several different theories about the origin of this verse.

There is a saying that before Master Xuan Zang went to India to study Buddhist scriptures, he saw the incarnation of Guanyin Bodhisattva.

Guanyin Bodhisattva transformed himself into a sickly old man and passed the Heart Sutra to Master Xuan Zang.

When Master Xuan Zang encountered demonic obstacles and difficulties on his way to obtain scriptures, he recited the Heart Sutra and passed through these ordeals.

Therefore, when Master Xuan Zang translated the Heart Sutra, he added the phrase "to save all suffering".

But I guess it shouldn't be.

The "Heart Sutra" translated by Master Kumarajiva also contains "relieving all suffering", and when Master Kumarajiva translated the "Heart Sutra" in 409 CE, Master Xuan Zang in 649 CE, and Master Kumarajiva Bi Xuan Master Xuan Zang's translation was more than two hundred years earlier.

Therefore, it could not have been added by Master Xuan Zang, as some masters say.

Buddha Shakyamuni used Sanskrit when he preached the scriptures. There are two types of scriptures recorded in India in the later period: Sanskrit and Pali. In some versions of the Heart Sutra, there is likely to be the sentence "Saving all suffering."

There is this sentence in the Great Prajna Sutra. Not only it, but also in the Great Prajna Sutra, it is said that any pain, trouble, or demonic obstacles can be overcome by reciting the Great Prajna Sutra.

The Great Prajna Sutra has this kind of merit, and the Heart Sutra should have the same merit.

So, is there any merit in reciting the Heart Sutra to break through obstacles?

There is! When encountering difficulties, recite the Heart Sutra immediately, and you can get through the difficulties; if you encounter a demonic obstacle, recite the Heart Sutra immediately, and you can also get rid of the demonic obstacle.

Not only that, but there is also an exorcism ritual at the end of the Tibetan version of the Heart Sutra, which was created by Nagarjuna.

When masters in Tibetan areas begin to teach sutras or encounter difficulties, they would use this ritual of exorcism to break through obstacles.

Tibetan Buddhism also combines the "Heart Sutra" with esoteric methods, and uses the "Heart Sutra" to expel various rituals such as death demons.

The "du" in "to save all suffering" is translated as "du" in some versions.

The three-pointed water of "crossing" represents the three seas of suffering, greed, hatred, and delusion.

The Heart Sutra talks about emptiness.

 Once you realize emptiness, you will overcome the sea of ​​suffering of greed, hatred, and delusion, and you will be free from greed, hatred, and delusion.

"All suffering", suffering is suffering, suffering is difficulty and trouble.

In different versions of the Heart Sutra, some refer to "all sufferings" and some refer to "all sufferings".

Practising the Heart Sutra can save you from all pains, difficulties and afflictions, and the Heart Sutra is so extraordinary.

5.  Chief Disciple Shariputra

Shariputra is also called Shariputra. In the Heart Sutra translated by Master Kumarajiva, he is called Shariputra. In other scriptures taught by Buddha, he is called Shariputra, and he is one of the chief disciples of Buddha.

Buddha Shakyamuni has two great disciples, Shariputra is the first in wisdom, and Maudgalyāyana the first in supernatural powers.


The Heart Sutra, like other classics taught by the Buddha, has Introductory Elements, Nature of the Text that is to be Explained, and praise.

The Introductory Elements is Shariputra asking Guanyin Bodhisattva, which is available in other versions, but the "Heart Sutra" translated by Master Xuan Zang does not have this part, only the right line, without the Introductory Elements and the praise.

Here is the end of the forward line, entering the right line, Shariputra asked, Guanyin Bodhisattva answered, and the Guanyin Bodhisattva was calling the name of Shariputra: "Sarizi!...".

Here is the real beginning of the Heart Sutra.

##### Chapter 3 - Human beings without self and the Bodhisattva Path of Accumulation

"Form is not different from emptiness and emptiness is not different from form and form is emptiness and emptiness, which is form, feeling, thought, action and consciousness, and so on."

We have said that the explicit meaning of the Heart Sutra is emptiness, and different schools of Buddhism have different understandings of emptiness.

Mahayana Buddhism's understanding of the Buddha's Dependent Origination of Empty Right View is basically divided into two schools: Mind-Only and Madhyamika. The two schools have different understandings and different teachings.

Regarding emptiness, the Mind-Only School believes that all dharmas are empty and only changed by the mind.

Seeing "colorless, scented, touch, dharma, no vision, and even the world of unconsciousness" , the Mind-Only School believes that this is saying that all dharmas do not exist in the external environment, but only exist in the heart. This is the emptiness that the Consciousness-Only School understands.

For example, for a glass of water, the Mind-Only School believes that if a glass of water exists in the external environment, it should always be water, and what any living being sees should be water.

Precisely because it does not exist externally, people see this glass of water as water, gods see it as nectar, and hungry ghosts see it as pus and blood, because it only exists inside.

Since all dharmas do not exist in the external world, there is no need to be attached to the external world, because the existence of all things is only related to one's own mind.

For another example, a person does not exist externally, so some people see him as a good person, while others see him as a bad person.

If it exists in the external world, a bad person should be a bad person, and no one should see him as a good person; a good person is a good person, and no one sees him as a bad person.

The Mind-Only School mainly talks about the existence and non-existence of all things in the external environment. Master Tang Xuanzang is the founder of the Mind-Only School in Han.

The Madhyamikas don't see it that way. The Madhyamikas believe that the outside world must exist.

Similarly, when talking about a glass of water, the Madhyamika school believes that this glass of water exists, but the minds of sentient beings will change due to karma and blessings, and the external environment they see will be different.

This glass of water has great blessings for devas and people, so it is regarded as nectar; hungry ghosts have heavy karma, so it is regarded as pus and blood; the blessings of human beings are average, so it is regarded as water.

This is the Madhyamika view of everything and everything. The Gelug School upholds the view of the Yingcheng School in the right view. Therefore, in the following, we will discuss the explicit meaning of the Heart Sutra from the viewpoint of the Madhyamika School of Yingcheng School. emptiness.

"Form is not different from emptiness and emptiness is not different from form, form is emptiness is form" , form refers to form, and everything we can see and touch belongs to form.

This sentence is about the relationship between materiality and emptiness. Let's take a look at the two schools of speech from a literal interpretation.

Because the Mind-Only School believes that all dharmas do not exist in the external environment, but only exist in the inner mind. Therefore, "form is not different from emptiness" means that material dharmas are the self-realization points that can take the emptiness of the external world.

That is to say, materiality is nothing but a state that can be grasped (eye-consciousness) and realized by a self-conscious realization of the grasped (external environment). "; "Empty is not different from form" is the self-realization of the appearance of form, which means that although all things do not exist in the external environment, the form of the realm realized by this self-conscious realization is form; "Form is emptiness" is the form that appears. It is self-realization, which means that the materiality we think is the result of the realization of the effect of self-conscious realization of the external environment; "emptiness is form" is the material that does not appear outside the self-realization, that is, except for our self-conscious realization. Apart from the materiality that is manifested, there is no other materiality.

The interpretation of the Madhyamika Yingcheng School is as follows: "Form is not different from emptiness" means the appearance of materiality, because materiality is emptiness, that is, without self-nature, and is dependent on origin, so it can appear without hindrance; "Empty is not different from form" means that emptiness has no self-nature, so it can manifest form;

twenty three

"Form is emptiness" means that the materiality that ordinary people think is imaginary and does not exist; "emptiness is form" means that materiality with self-nature does not exist, except for form without self-nature, there is no other materiality.

The emptiness of "form is not different from emptiness" refers to  emptiness of self-nature.

The Heart Sutra says that form is emptiness, and form is not different from emptiness. It is based on the appearance of form but without self-nature to dispel the borders of samsara. It is to eliminate the sufferings of sentient beings who are greedy for conditioned dharmas.

He also said that emptiness is a form, and emptiness is not a different form, so the edge of silence is cut off, in order to cut off the greed for emptiness of sentient beings.

Form is when emptiness is cut off and there are edges, and emptiness is when form is cut off and borders are cut off.

"The same is true for feelings, thoughts, actions, and consciousness" , which means that the other four aggregates have the same understanding and feeling of all things as they do with materiality.

This sentence can be read like this: Feeling is not empty, empty is not feeling, feeling is empty, empty is feeling; thinking is not empty, empty is not also thinking, thinking is empty, empty is thinking; Empty, not emptiness is also action, action is emptiness, emptiness is action; consciousness is not empty, empty is not consciousness, consciousness is emptiness, emptiness is consciousness.

The obvious meaning of this sutra is that "people have no ego", "people have no ego" is the wisdom sustenance of the Bodhisattva Path of Accumulation, and the implicit meaning is the blessings of the Bodhisattva Path of Accumulation.

twenty four

The first chapter without me
There are many purposes in studying Buddhism, but the most fundamental purpose is only two: liberation or Buddhahood.

This requires the removal of afflictions and knowledge obstacles. To completely remove the two obstacles, we must realize emptiness.

Emptiness consists of two parts: one is "people have no ego", that is, the people of Potegala have no ego, and when ego-clinging is broken, one realizes that people have no ego; Realized that there is no self in the Dharma.

Humans, we always say "I", such as "How am I...", and think that "I" is real. If we say that there is no such "I", we will definitely not believe it.

So, how do we set up this "I"? Generally speaking, they rest on their five aggregates, that is, on form, feeling, perception, formation, and consciousness.

1. The "I" that ordinary people think about

Some people think that the aggregate of form, that is, the body, is "I".

If he says "people don't have me", he will understand that he is saying that there is no me, and he will say: there must be me, how can there be no me.

If someone asks him, where is your me? He would say, my body is me.

To think that the body is me is to understand and settle the "I" in the aggregate of form.

Some people think that the aggregate of feeling is "I", and feeling is all kinds of pain and pleasure.

Why do you say that the khandha is me? He will say, if you have a headache, you will say that "I" is sick, and you think that the feeling of pain is "I"; when you are happy, it is "I" who is happy, so you think that the feeling of pain and pleasure is me.

Some people think that the aggregate of perception is "I", and that the aggregate of perception is all kinds of thoughts; others think that consciousness is me.

Except for the four aggregates of form, feeling, perception, and consciousness, all dharmas belong to the aggregates of formations.

For example, the sky is not form, not feeling, not thinking, not consciousness, but action.

Liberation is action, and Nirvana is action too. Some people think that the aggregate of action is "I".

All of the above are what ordinary people think of me, and they are all ego-clinging "Is", that is, the "I" we want to get rid of.

2. The fault of ego

Why break the ego? Because our afflictions are all caused by ego, all because of the word "I".

For example, if someone beats and scolds me, we would say, he beat me, how could I not be angry? It's because of "I".

He scolds me, how can I not be angry? Also because of "I".

For another example, if the business goes bankrupt, how can I not be anxious? It's also "me"; how can I not worry about myself or my family being ill? Worrying that my body is going to collapse is also because of "I".

How can I not be jealous if I see that someone is better than me, that he is taller and better than me? Jealousy is also caused by "I".

Arrogance is also "I", I have everything now, and they are no match for me.

Desires such as greed, hatred, ignorance, arrogance, doubt, and jealousy are all caused by the word "I".

After defilements arise, more karmic obstacles will arise, not just one or two karmic obstacles. With karmic obstacles, there will be suffering.

Now, we understand why we need to break this "me", break the ego, and the "me" we are attached to will be broken. Without this "me", all the worries caused by the "me" will be gone. .

At this time, when someone hits me, I will not be angry.

Because I already understand that without this "I" and I can't hit "I", there will be no anger, no greed, no jealousy, and there will be no afflictions, because the root of afflictions is gone.

27

3. Finding the "I" of the ego

The "I" that we are attached to and think of now is the "I" that we want to break, and it does not exist.

And I exist, there is a difference between me and the "I" we want to break.

If I don't have it, how can we get rid of it? How to become a Buddha? I exist, I cannot be broken, and I cannot be broken.

What we want to break is the non-existent "I" of ego. If we don't break it, the pain will be endless.

Now, let's think about what kind of "I" we think it is, and whether there is such an "I".

If you think there is, then think about how you think there is an "I", and whether this "I" is the body? Or consciousness? Is it thought? Or can we feel it? Or some other thing?

Does this "I" have a top or bottom? No; 

Is it a feeling of pain and pleasure? No; 

Is it thought? No; 

Is it consciousness? No; 

Is it the aggregate of formations? Not that either.

Where is this "I"? Does it exist or not? If someone replies that it doesn't exist, they fall into a the extreme of nihilism.

Some people say that the unity of body and mind is "I", while others say that the unity of the five aggregates is "I".

If the unity of body and mind is "I", "I" will be either one or different. Body and mind are two things. If they are one, they become one. We know that it is impossible. If it is said that the "I" becomes two, it does not make sense. The same is true for the saying that the five aggregates are one, and it does not make sense.

First of all, we are looking for the imaginary "I". Since it is said that "I" does not exist in the body, does not exist in the mind, and does not exist in the five aggregates; then where does the "I" exist? The "me" that most of us imagine is like this: if we are slapped in the face, we will say "me" is very painful, at this time, we will think that our face is "me".

When you have a headache, you will say "I" and think your head is "I".

So, is the face "I"? No, is the head "I"? No, the face and head are "mine".

There is a difference between "I" and "mine". My things are not "me", but an imaginary "me".

When many people are there, if I say: Dorje, you stole my things.

If Dorje didn't steal, he would say: I didn't steal, why did you wrong me, Master? At this time, Dorje will feel as if there is a very strong qi in the body, rushing straight from the lower part of the body to the top of the head. This feeling is the me we imagine, this "I" does not actually exist.

If the "I" is broken, the mood will naturally calm down. At this time, if you can calm down and observe, you can immediately recognize this false "I".

There was a master of the Kagyu sect whose father was killed before he became a monk. After he became a monk, he worshipped under the door of the very accomplished Master Pamu Drupa.

After apprenticeship, although he has been cultivating, he still can't let go of his hatred for the enemy who killed his father.

I was also very distressed, so I went to ask the master, and the master said, I have a solution.

A few days later, the master invited the man who killed his father to have tea together at home.

Then the master sent someone to call him, and when he saw the enemy who killed his father, he rushed over and tried to beat him.

At this time, the master said: "Look, your me is so powerful! You have to see where your me is now!"

After reminding him like this, he understood it all at once, immediately grabbed the imaginary me, and realized emptiness.

4. Consciousness is not "I"

It is difficult to actually find the imaginary "me".

We sometimes think that the feelings of suffering and happiness are "I", sometimes we think that the mind is "I", and sometimes we think that the eye-consciousness, ear-consciousness, nose-consciousness, tongue-consciousness, body-consciousness, and consciousness are "I".

Especially consciousness, when we think that we are constantly reincarnated in the six realms, and it is these 30 consciousnesses that have been reincarnated from generation to generation, to a large extent we think that consciousness is me.

Not only do we think that consciousness is "I", but some of the four major sects of Buddhism in India, including the sects, the sects of scriptures, and the Madhyamika self-tantra sect, all think that consciousness is "I".

They think that if consciousness is not "I", where is the "I"? There is no way to find this "I".

At this time, the Madhyamika Prasanghika faction will retort: ​​If consciousness is "I", which one is the consciousness of a person's past life, current life, and future life? Even today’s consciousness can be divided into morning, noon, and afternoon, and every minute of consciousness can also be divided into just now, present, and future. If the three are all, these three consciousnesses are different, then The "I" becomes three different ones; if one insists that the "I" is one, the three consciousnesses become one; neither case makes sense.

Therefore, consciousness is not "I".

5. The "I" of the Madhyamika Prasanghika School

The Gelug School adheres to the Madhyamika Prasanghika School's view in the right view, so how does the Madhyamika Prasanghika School think of this "I"? The Madhyamika Prasanghika School believes that "I" is the I of Pudgala who established on the five aggregates and exists on the famous sayings.

31

What does "in the name of existence" mean? For example, when I was young, my grandfather named me "Sonam Dorje".

Before the age of eighteen, everyone thought I was Sonam Dorje, and I existed under the name Sonam Dorje.

After I became a monk at the age of eighteen, Dharma Master Yongzeng named me "Ngawang Gyatso", not Sonam Dorje, so since I was eighteen years old, I existed under the name of Ngawang Gyatso.

For another example, if a teacup is called teacup in Chinese, it exists on the “teacup”; Tibetans call it Gage, it is Gage, not a teacup; if it is called Cup in English, it becomes Cup, so it is the difference exists in the name.

Another example is that a person is the mayor now, but he is not the mayor when he does not hold the post of mayor.

After being promoted from mayor to the county magistrate, he is the county magistrate. If the title of the county magistrate is changed, he is no longer the county magistrate.

But no matter how these titles are changed, the person is always that person.

Therefore, this person has always existed on the famous words, and all things exist on the famous words.

Myriad phenomena and myriad formations exist only in famous words, which is the highest interpretation of the Madhyamika School of Enlightenment. Once you understand this sentence, you will understand half emptiness.

32

6. The general meaning and name of emptiness

When a practitioner is in the ordinary stage, by listening to the Dharma, constantly listening and thinking about the practice, relying on the power of hearing and thinking, he can access the name and general meaning of emptiness, and can understand emptiness.

What does the name of emptiness mean? For example, if someone who has never been to Lhasa hears others say what Lhasa is like, they can imagine a state in their mind according to what he said. This is called a name.

The name of emptiness means that before you have realized emptiness, you have heard Master talk about emptiness and have some understanding in your heart, thinking that emptiness should be like this or that. This is called understanding the name of emptiness.

People who have been to Lhasa, when they come back, recall Lhasa and think of the state of Lhasa in their hearts. This understanding is called general meaning.

The emptiness understood by hearing power is the name of emptiness, the emptiness obtained through thinking and hearing, not the real realization of emptiness.

The emptiness understood by the power of thinking is the general meaning of emptiness, and the general meaning of emptiness is the realization of emptiness by comparison.

Bodhisattvas do not necessarily realize emptiness when they are on the Lesser Stage of the path of accumulation, but they can understand emptiness through the name and general meaning of emptiness.

33

Section 2 - Bodhisattva Path of Accumulation

"Form is not different from emptiness and emptiness is not different from form and form is emptiness and emptiness, which is form, feeling, thought, action and consciousness, and so on."

The hidden meaning of this sutra is the bodhisattva's path of accumulation.

Buddhism is divided into Mahayana and Hinayana. Now Thailand and Sri Lanka are Theravada Buddhism, and Chinese and Tibetan areas are Mahayana Buddhism. There are many differences between Mahayana and Mahayana. Here we are talking about the path of accumulation in Mahayana Buddhism.

Why is it called the path of accumulation? In order to be liberated and become a Buddha when we study Buddhism, we need to accumulate vast merit and virtue, which are basically completed during this period, so it is called the path of accumulation.

Some of the four major schools of Buddhism and the sects of scriptures believe that the merit of the three major Asamkhya kalpas need to be accumulated during the path of accumulation.

The Madhyamika school believes that the merit of the first asamkhayal kalpa in the three three asamkhya kalpas are accumulated in the path of accumulation and cultivation; the second largest asamkhyal kalpa is accumulated when the bodhisattva first arrives at the seventh bhumi. Blessings; from the eighth bhumi to the tenth bhumi, the merit of the third largest Asamkhya kalpa are accumulated.

Although different schools of thought have different opinions, we just need to understand that starting from the path of accumulation we can accumulate great merit for liberation and Buddhahood.

The Bodhisattva Path of Accumulation is divided into lower, intermediate, and greater stages, and each stage is different in terms of study, practice, realization, and merit.

34

In terms of specific cultivation methods, The Lesser Stage material path mainly cultivates the four mindfulness; The Intermediate Stage material path mainly cultivates the four righteous renunciations; the high-grade material path mainly cultivates the four spiritual feet.

The purpose is to get rid of gross suffering, to get rid of gross suffering, and to subdue the grosser afflictions.

From the moment of attaining bodhicitta, one has entered the path of bodhisattva resources.

If you do not have bodhicitta, even if you have cut off your afflictions, you will not be a bodhisattva.

For example, although the Hinayana arhats have cut off their afflictions and have high wisdom and supernatural powers, they have not reached the bodhisattva path of  accumulation, and they are not bodhisattvas because they do not have bodhicitta.

#### 1. Bodhicitta

Bodhicitta is the heart that oneself want to become a Buddha for the sake of all sentient beings of the six realms of who are free from suffering and obtain happiness.

From the moment of attaining bodhicitta, practitioners have truly entered the door of Mahayana Buddhism.

So, how to generate bodhicitta? There are two ways to generate bodhicitta, The Seven-Point Cause and Effect Instruction and the instruction on Exchanging Self for others. Let's talk about The Seven-Point Cause and Effect Instruction first.

35

##### (1) The Seven-Point Cause and Effect Instruction


Bodhicitta is generated through seven steps, so it is called The Seven-Point Cause and Effect Instruction.

Except for the first step, each step has a causal relationship with the previous steps, so it is called Bodhicitta.

The first is Recognizing all sentient beings as one's mother.

How to identify it? We have been reincarnated countless times in reincarnation, and the number of reincarnations is more than the sand in the universe. Every reincarnation has a mother. Therefore, all beings in the six realms have been our mothers when we were reincarnated.

And not just once or twice, but millions and countless times.

The most basic of the bodhisattva way is to recognize that all beings in the six realms are mothers, which is the foundation of bodhicitta.

The second is Recognizing the kindness of mother sentient beings. Since it is a mother, how much kindness is my biological mother to us, and sentient beings in the six realms also have the same kindness to us.

The third is Repaying their kindness. After thinking about my mother's kindness, I want to think about how to repay my mother's kindness. The best way to repay my mother's kindness is to guide my mother's sentient beings into Buddhism and let her practice the Dharma. In this way, at least later generations will not fall into evil realms.

The fourth branch is Affectionate love. 

What we often recite, "May all sentient beings be blessed with happiness and the cause of happiness," is the act of loving kindness.

To all sentient beings, express the kindness of a mother to her son, and may all sentient beings always have happiness and the cause of happiness.

The fifth branch sends out Great compassion. "May all sentient beings be free from suffering and the causes of suffering", which means compassion.

All sentient beings in the six realms have great suffering, and the causes of these sufferings are afflictions and karma. We must think in our hearts that every sentient being is free from suffering and the causes of suffering, which is to express compassion.

The sixth point, The extraordinary intention, increases the sense of responsibility. Think about it: "I am a child of sentient beings in the six realms, and I have the responsibility to guide my mother's sentient beings to get away from suffering and achieve happiness."

Then think about it again: Do I have the ability to help my mother be free from suffering and achieve happiness?

No.

There is no ability to help one's own mother get rid of suffering and attain happiness, let alone help the mothers of living beings in the six realms.

The seventh point is to generate Bodhicitta. 

Who has the ability to free living beings in the six realms from suffering and attain happiness? Arhats? Earth Bodhisattvas? None of them have this ability, and the one who has this ability is a Buddha.

Therefore, I want to set my mind: In order for sentient beings in the six realms to be free from suffering and achieve happiness, I want to become a Buddha. After becoming a Buddha, I will immediately save my mother sentient beings, so that sentient beings can be free from suffering and achieve happiness.

This is the Bodhicitta arising from The Seven-Point Cause and Effect Instruction.

(2) Bodhicitta of Exchanging Oneself and Others.

37

The instructions on exchanging oneself with others consist of five main points:

1. Equalizing oneself with others

2. The disadvantage of cherishing oneself

3. The advantages of cherishing others

4. The actual thought of exchanging oneself with others

5. The meditation on giving and taking (tonglen)

The "exchange" of Exchanging Self for Others does not mean exchanging oneself with others, but exchanging one's self-interest of loving oneself and respecting only oneself for an altruistic heart of loving and respecting others.

Use this kind of altruism to replace your own self-interest, and then increase your sense of responsibility. The bodhicitta that arises at this time is the bodhicitta of exchanging self for others.

The Treatise on Entering Bodhisattva Actions states:

If there is a desire to hurry, the rescue will reach him,

He should be exchanged for him, and the secret should be done.

Compared with the seven-branch karma to generate bodhicitta, it is faster and more courageous to cultivate bodhicitta by Exchanging Oneself and Others, and there are many extraordinary merits.

To Exchange Oneself and Others, we must first know the disadvantage of cherishing oneself.

In the Treatise on Entering Bodhisattva Actions, it says:

>
>All the happiness in the world, 
>
>all from altruism,

All beings are poisoned by swords and soldiers, obstructed and violated by heavenly dragons and evil ghosts, and even being born in hells, hungry ghosts, animal realms, etc., all of which stem from doing evil karma such as killing for their own benefit.

In our daily life, all kinds of ailments, conflicts and afflictions in our bodies, failures at work, being excluded, and even suffering from lawsuits and violating national laws, also stem from self-interest.

Why does everyone naturally respect Buddhas and Bodhisattvas? 

It is also because Buddhas and Bodhisattvas love and respect all beings.

The Buddhist scriptures say: 

>
>"Whatever deeds they do - good or evil - 
>
>of such they will be their heirs"
>S

Equalizing oneself with others

Respecting others, you will also be respected and loved by others. This is a causal relationship.

At the same time, it can also be explained: the more sentient beings that can be loved and respected, the more you will be loved and respected.

If we can love people all over the world, then people all over the world will love us; if we can love all beings in the six realms, all living beings in the six realms will love us; if we can love ghosts, demons, and debtors, they will not harm us.

When ghosts and demons who live by harming people encounter bodhisattvas, they will not only do no harm to them, but also make offerings. The reason is very simple. They are also sentient beings. Bodhisattvas have compassion for them, love them, and will not harm them. They can feel it.

When Venerable Atisha first came to Tibet, many people came to greet him.

Everyone saw Venerable Atisha, and saw Venerable clasping his hands all the time, bowing his head humbly.

Everyone said: Ah, the masters respect us.

Because Venerable Atisha respected everyone, everyone liked him when Venerable Atisha went to Tibet.

When cultivating the bodhicitta of self-exchange exchange, one must first cultivate the first five parts of the bodhicitta of The Seven-Point Cause and Effect Instruction.

Then use the method of visualization to practice the exchange of self-alliance with others. Visualize that all kinds of altruistic hearts are used to replace the self-interested heart that loves me and respects me, and then develops the sense of responsibility, and then develops the bodhicitta.

When visualizing, there are many aspects to be exchanged: one’s own happiness is exchanged for others’ pain, one’s health is exchanged for others’ sickness, one’s ability is exchanged for others’ powerlessness, one’s wisdom is exchanged for others’ ignorance, one’s own blessings are exchanged. Retribution is exchanged with others' karma, one's own merits are exchanged with others' faults, and one's great happiness is exchanged with others' afflictions.

When meditating, visualize the above-mentioned happiness, wisdom, blessings, etc., which will become immeasurable white light, emanating from your right nostril and entering the left nostril of beings in the six realms. Happy, good news.

Then visualize the karma and afflictions of living beings in the six realms mentioned above, all turning into black air, flowing out from the right nostril of living beings in the six realms, inhaling it through your left nostril, and visualizing hitting your ego and breaking it. I do.

This is the meditation method of Exchanging Oneself and Others.

If you often meditate in this way, you will feel that you have accepted the karma and illness of others.

After accepting this, the body will get sick, but because of the power of bodhicitta, this sickness will eventually be eliminated.

In the past, very, very few people in Tibet had serious illnesses such as cancer. It was because there were many masters with relatively great achievements who often practiced the bodhicitta of self-exchange and exchange of self for others , exchanged the illnesses of sentient beings, and prevented many people from getting cancer.

There was once a tumor disease in Tibetan areas, that is, tumors on the neck. This disease was especially common in Gui de County, in Qinghai.

Later, Gui de produced a great siddhi master Taxiu. He often exchanged bodhicitta from him and sucked the tumors of all living beings. Finally, a large tumor grew on his neck. Since then, there will be no more there. This disease has occurred.

After Master Taxiu practiced for a few more years, his illness gradually recovered. This is the power of Exchanging Oneself and Others.

Geshe Chekawa, a disciple of the Kadampa master Geshe Sharawa, is known as the Dharma King of Lepers in Tibet.

There was no way to cure leprosy before. Geshe Chekawa treated the newly arrived leprosy patients with the method of Exchanging Oneself and Others.

Then, Geshe Chekawa taught these lepers to practice the Three Ways and exchange bodhicitta with them.

Everyone thinks that this master's teaching is to cure leprosy, but in fact, Geshe Chekawa taught them the three ways, especially the bodhicitta of self-exchange in the three ways.

After the lepers recovered, they continued to practice self-exchange bodhicitta. In the end, most of them achieved it.

##### (3) Twenty-two Similes of Bodhicitta

Maitreya Bodhisattva uses similes to divide bodhicitta into twenty-two subdivisions in his "Ornament for Clear Realization": 

The examples or similes are as follows: 1) the earth, 2) fine gold, 3) the waxing moon, 4) fire, 5) a great treasure, 6) jewel-mine, 7) the great ocean, 8) a vajra, 9) the king of mountains, 10) medicine, 11)  a spiritual guide, 12) a wish-fulfilling jewel, 13) the sun, 14) a sweet-sounding song of Dharma, 15) a great king, 16) a treasury, 17) a great highway, 18) an excellent horse, 19) a spring of water, 20) sweet-sounding music, 21) the flow of a river and 22) a cloud.

[https://www.lotsawahouse.org/tibetan-masters/khenpo-tsondru/seventy-points-abhisamayalankara#fn:14]

Once you get bodhicitta, you become a bodhisattva, and you get the blessings of entering the path of resources.

Just after attaining bodhicitta, he entered the path of low-grade resources, and the first thing a Bodhisattva attained on the path of low-grade resources was earth bodhicitta.

Just like there are mountains and rivers on the earth, and the scenery will change, the bodhicitta of the earth will change, and sometimes there will be a retreat.

The Bodhisattva's bodhicitta is called the Golden Bodhicitta. From here, the bodhicitta will never turn back.

Why is it called Golden Bodhicitta? Whether gold is burnt or ground, its nature will not change. Golden Bodhicitta is a metaphor for bodhicitta at this level.

From the moment of attaining the Golden Bodhicitta, The Intermediate Stage Path of Accumulation Bodhisattva's vows will be very strong, and the accumulated blessings will be very large. If you can get meditation, the meditation power will be relatively strong, so you will have great power in doing things.

The Bodhisatta attained by the Bodhisattva of the High-grade Path of Accumulation is Moon Bodhicitta.

Twenty-two bodhi hearts, the first nineteen are Bodhisattva's Bodhisattva

Mindfulness, the last three are the Buddha's bodhicitta.

With the gradual deepening of subsequent practice, the Bodhisattva will complete the nineteen levels of bodhicitta until he attains Buddhahood.

##### 2. four applications of mindfulness

The four applications of mindfulness are: application of mindfulness to the body, application of mindfulness to feelings, application of mindfulness to mind, and application of mindfulness to phenomena.

Mindfulness is the wisdom to understand that there is no self, and abiding is a kind of meditation.

Not only does one understand that there is no-self, but the mind can also settle in the concentration of no-self, and then one obtains mindfulness.

**(1) Application of mindfulness to the body**

Application of mindfulness to the body is to contemplate the impurity of the body.

Application of mindfulness to the body can deal with attachment to the body, which is the craving of the body. Needless to say, we ordinary people are greedy, and the bodhisattvas of The Lesser Stage Path of Accumulation also have greed. This kind of greed is actually a kind of affliction. If we see that we are handsome or beautiful, or that other people are beautiful, and we become greedy, we must deal with it. If there is no governance, there will be more afflictions due to greed, and even fall into the evil realm after death.

There is a story in the classics, a long time ago, there was a girl in India who was very beautiful. She didn't know she was so beautiful because it used to be difficult to find a mirror.

Once, she accidentally got hold of a mirror, and at a glance, Wow! She is so beautiful that she is greedy for her appearance.

She kept looking in the mirror, and when she passed the sea, the boat capsized and she died.

After she died, he turned into a snake, wrapped around the mirror, coveting her own body to such an extent.

If you are very greedy for your own body, you can visualize your body growing a lot of acne, which is very unsightly.

The tantric method is to first visualize the Sanskrit word A () on the forehead. The word A has produced a lot of pimples, and gradually the whole body is rotten, and finally only bones are left.

Then ask yourself again: Are you still greedy for this body? Are you greedy for these bones? In this way, the trouble is gradually solved.

If you are greedy for someone else, you can visualize the other person's forehead with the word "A". The word "A" has produced a lot of acne, and the body is extremely dirty. At this time, ask yourself whether you are still greedy or not.

---

TODO - already translated in Book 4

In the past, there was a king in India. He loved a concubine very much, and he was never away from this concubine.

Once, to go to war, I had to leave Concubine Ai at home.

The day after he left, Concubine Ai died, and the courtiers were very frightened, worried that they would not be able to explain to the king.

A wise minister said:

"I have a solution. We will send a letter to the king tomorrow and tell the king first that there is a pimple on the forehead of Concubine Ai."

After seeing the letter, the king was very worried:

"Oh, Concubine Ai has a pimple on her head. If it wasn't for the war, I would definitely go back to see her."

A few days later, another messenger came, and the king asked:

"How is Aifei?"

The messenger said:

"There are a lot of pimples on the head again."

The king was very surprised.

The next time, the messenger said:

"Your concubine is full of pimples now."

The king felt that his concubine was helpless.

When reporting the letter again, the messenger said: "Now I have acne all over my body."

The king thought, "I don't want to see her anymore."

In this way, the king's greed was broken step by step.

If he had just started reporting truthfully, the king would have been very angry, and he might have killed the left-behind ministers and those who took care of his beloved concubine. The king's greed would be cut off, and everyone would be at peace with each other.

---

When the Bodhisattva of The Lesser Stage of the Path of Accumulation cultivates his body and meditates, he should visualize that all the bodies of people in the whole world have rotted away, leaving only the bones. The mind is fixed on the bones and visualized. will be greedy.

Self-cultivation, mindfulness and contemplation of the impurity of the body does not mean that the body should be neglected.

It means not to be too greedy for this body, not to cherish and take care of this body too much, just enough food and clothing.

**(2) Application of mindfulness to feelings**

Application of mindfulness to feelings is to see feeling as suffering.

Needless to say, the feeling of suffering, even the feeling that we usually think of as happiness is impermanent and becomes suffering.

Life is a bitterness, and the word bitterness is like the face of a person. We don’t understand that life is hard, and we have been pursuing love, wealth, and so on. These are actually suffering.

If you carefully consider the nature of various pleasant feelings, you will find that there are hidden karma and afflictions behind them.

There is no real pleasure, happiness is only superficial, but we feel it is real happiness.

When meditating on the Application of mindfulness to feelings, one should also contemplate pleasant feeling as impermanent.

For example, when you eat a meal, you will be happy when you eat it, but it will be nothing after you eat it.

If you eat too much, you will get sick, and it will become bitter.

It is important to understand that not only suffering is suffering, but the present happiness is also impermanent and will also become suffering.

**(3) Application of mindfulness to mind**

Application of mindfulness to mind is contemplation of impermanence.

Constant is eternity, our mind is impermanent and changes every moment.

Therefore, don't be greedy for relatives and friends, because his heart will also change, and he will become an enemy.

Don't hate the enemy. The enemy's heart is also impermanent, and it will change and become a friend.

The mind is not only impermanent in this life, but also in the future.

For example, we are not necessarily human after death, but may become living beings in other realms such as hungry ghosts. These are all impermanent thoughts in our minds.

The mind is changing moment by moment, everything is impermanent, and it changes every moment, so don’t be greedy, just observe these things.

**(4) Application of mindfulness to phenomena**

Application of mindfulness to phenomena is the contemplation of Dharma without self.

Application of mindfulness to phenomena is mainly about contemplating emptiness. Regularly meditating on the lack of self in people and the lack of self in the phenomena, and when the mind is fixed in the nature of emptiness, is called Application of mindfulness to phenomena.

Let's think about the Application of Mindfulness to Phenomena according to the Four important Principles taught by Master Tsongkhapa.

##### The Four Important Principles: 

First of all, we must recognize the "I" that is attached to the ego; after the identification, we should think according to the right principles. If this "I" exists, whether it is one or different from the five aggregates; think about the "I".

47 

It is unreasonable to be one with the five aggregates; it is unreasonable to think that "I" and the five aggregates are different.

Take, for example, thinking that consciousness is "I."

If "I" and consciousness are one, because there is only one "I", then my consciousness from one year old to fifty years old becomes one. If this is the case, a one-year-old child will have a the wisdom of a fifty-year-old.

But this is impossible, so "I" and consciousness are not one.

If "I" is different from consciousness, and there is so much consciousness, "I" should also become so much.

But in fact there is only one "I"; therefore, there is no situation where "I" and consciousness are different.

Since the existence of "I" and consciousness cannot be established in one or another, this false "I" should not exist.

Many people think that when they cannot find me in the five aggregates of name-and-form, they will naturally see that all phenomena do not exist, thinking that this is emptiness.

This is wrong, this is not emptiness, it is imaginary emptiness.

It is the false self that we need to eliminate by meditating on emptiness, that is, ego-attachment and phenomena-attachment, not Dependent Origination, not to mention all phenomena and myriad formations.

Even if I have broken the false appearance, I will naturally see the emptiness where the myriad phenomena and myriad formations do not exist. This emptiness is the emptiness. I have lost all myriad phenomena and myriad formations in my lower consciousness, and my heart has not destroyed myriad phenomena and myriad formations.

48

All phenomena and all formations exist, so they cannot be non-existent. If you break down all phenomena and all formations in your mind, thinking that all phenomena and all formations do not exist, you will fall into the extreme of nihilism and fall into stubborn emptiness.

This is the Four Applications of Mindfulness of the Bodhisattva Path of Accumulation.

##### 3. Four Correct Abandonments

During the time of The Intermediate Stage material, there are mainly four correct abandonments.

1. Do not develop any non-virtuous tendencies

2. Eliminate any non-virtuous tendencies

3. Cultivate any virtuous tendencies

4. Virtues we have cultivated are further increased

The rhythm cuts off all unwholesome things.

The good karma that should be born must be born, and the evil that should be eliminated must be eliminated.

Before reaching the Path of Accumulation, the evil karma that should be cut off cannot be cut off, and the good karma that should be born cannot arise.

In my mind I wanted not to do bad karma, but I couldn't help it, because my habit was very heavy, so I did it naturally.

For example, if you know you shouldn't kill a living being, you will still kill ants and cockroaches through habit.

After entering the Path of Accumulation, these evil thoughts that should be cut off will be easily cut off.

No evil is born, no evil is born.

If there is no evil, no evil will arise, and the Bodhisattva of the path of accumulation must cultivate not to have a single evil thought.

Although it may not be absolutely no evil thoughts, it will be very rare.

The ten wholesome deeds of the Bodhisattva Path of Accumulation are constantly increasing day and night, and the thoughts of the ten unwholesome deeds are constantly being eliminated. 

These are the Four Correct Abandonments of the Bodhisattva Path of Accumulation.

##### 4. Four Supports of Miraculous Ability

The Bodhisattva of the Greater Stage of the Path of Accumulation mainly cultivates the Four Supports of Miraculous Ability.

If you cultivate to the point that whatever you think about in your heart will be fulfilled, you will be satisfied with your desires.

---

On the greater stage of the path of accumulation, we practise the four supports of miraculous ability:

The first of these is the 'miracle support' of determination(9), which is to meditate with enthusiasm and aspiration towards meditative concentration, so that the mind does not stray into lack of faith or wrong views.

The second, the miracle support of exertion(10), is to apply ourselves with diligence to the practice of meditative concentration, and to exert ourselves in both eliminating any faults or obstacles, and in cultivating the necessary qualities, so that we remain unaffected by temporary circumstances.

The third is the miracle support of attention(11), which ensures that we remain in a state of one-pointed attention, thus avoiding the divided attention that is caught between various thoughts and distracting influences. Through this, we realize actual meditative concentration.

Fourth, the miracle support of discernment(12), helps us sustain meditative concentration during daily activity, as a way of gaining the miraculous powers, such as the superknowledges.

These four are called ‘supports’ because they support the meditative concentration out of which a range of miraculous attainments can arise.

By manifesting various miraculous powers on the greater path of accumulation, we can travel miraculously to the fields where buddhas actually reside. There, we can receive and master countless hundreds and thousands of Dharma teachings. Bodhisattvas who do this gain continuous meditative concentration which they are able to maintain through the strength of their wisdom.

---

miracle support' of determination

Diligence is very diligent and diligent in practice.

A bodhisattva of the Greater Stage of the Path of Accumulation, needless to say, for many sentient beings, even for one sentient being, if he were to go to hell to suffer for hundreds of thousands of kalpas, he would be very happy. This kind of mentality is called diligence.

A bodhisattva whose mind is full of high-quality food and sustenance, in order to obtain the path of practice, concentrates on meditation.

Before attaining the path of prestige, you can meditate for as long as you can in meditation. This is the contentment of the mind.

Watching the feet of the gods always observes one's body, speech, and mind, doing good deeds that should be done, cutting off evil that should be done, and keeping the precepts clean.

50

This is what the bodhisattva suffices to cultivate. In addition to this, there are four practices: to realize the pure precepts, to hear and think about the Dharma, to practice the Dharma, and to abide in the four holy seeds.

Witness and abide in the pure precepts and abide in the pure precepts.

When the Bodhisattva is on the path of resources, the precepts are very pure, and 99% of them will not break the precepts.

Hearing, thinking, and listening to the Dharma, because of listening to the right Dharma, since the three doors are gentle, and rationally thinking about the wonderful Dharma, all gains will be cut off.

When the Bodhisattva is on the path of accumulation, he mainly cultivates the Dharma of hearing, contemplation, and practice.

Hearing the Dharma is very important. To attain the fruition of the Bodhisattva, one must go through the stage of the path of accumulation, and listening, thinking, and cultivating is the cause of obtaining these results.

We are all ordinary people now, and we don’t know anything. If we don’t hear the Dharma, we don’t know how to go about the path of cultivation and how to cultivate. If you want to be liberated and become a Buddha, you must first listen to, read, and understand this path, and then you will not be wrong.

I didn't understand at all, I walked in a daze, and I would go back wherever I went.

To practice the Dharma, to practice the Dharma of liberation, eliminate afflictions.

Abiding by the Four Holy Seeds is not greedy for clothes, not greedy for food, not greedy for abode, not greedy for abstinence, and cultivates happiness.

Not greedy for clothes, not greedy for food.

The Bodhisattva of the way of resources is happy with clothes and food wherever he wants, and he is not greedy for clothes and food.

There is a great siddha Luyba in India. When he practiced, he did not look for food, but ate the internal organs thrown away by others when he was fishing.

We can't do it now, and we can't stand the food that doesn't taste good.

What Buddhism pursues is to get rid of suffering and achieve happiness. If you truly enter the Buddhist way, you will be very happy in what you do and eat.

Not greedy for a place to live.

When the Bodhisattva is on the path of resources, he can live wherever he wants.

Even living on the street, or in a very dirty warehouse, can be very happy.

If it were us, I would feel uncomfortable, and I would not be able to do it.

Venerable Milarepa didn't even have any clothes or quilts to cover. Passers-by saw Venerable Milarepa and thought he was pitiful.

Venerable Milarepa saw these people and felt that they were so pitiful.

The dharma in Venerable's heart, even if the happiness of the whole world is added up, it can't compare to it. At this level, that's how it is.

Happy break and repair.

Happiness means that when the Bodhisattva of the Accumulation Path cuts off evil thoughts and afflictions, he is happy and happy.

When we ordinary people want to give up evil thoughts and evil deeds, it will be very painful. It is very difficult for us to avoid greed, dislike, and jealousy of others. Therefore, when we break off evil thoughts, we will feel that our mental strength is insufficient.

52

Happy cultivation is to be happy in the process of cultivation. This is the real way to enter the Dharma.

Ordinary people have a lot of greed, hatred, and jealousy, and it is difficult to feel the kind of joy brought by inner peace. Learning Buddhism is difficult at this stage, and it is not difficult to enter the Dao.

The bodhisattva also needs to live in the five branches of the Path of Accumulation: accepting and upholding the precepts of different births, guarding the root gate, knowing the amount of food and drink, sleeping in yoga, and living in good Dharma and happiness.

"Alien birth" refers to us ordinary people, that is to say, in our daily life when the bodhisattva practives the Path of Accumulation, we must always observe our own body, speech and mind according to the precepts, and guard our five sense organs. To practice sleep sound yoga, you should sleep when you should be sleeping, and try not to sleep when you should not.

Because the Bodhisattva has already realized that the lifespan of a human being is very short, and the time to practice is only forty years between the ages of twenty and sixty. If you exclude sleeping, eating, etc., the real cultivation time may be ten years. You must seize the time to study, think, and cultivate diligently.

If you enter the Bodhisattva Path of Accumulation in tantra, you not only need to meditate on emptiness, but also practise tantric mantras, tantra of the second class, and so on.

In this way, one can quickly enter the Path of Joining from the Path of Accumulation.

It takes a long time to cultivate the Sutra Path of the Mahayana, whereas the parctice of the Vajrayana is very fast. You can go from the Path of Accumulation to the Path of Joining in the relatively short space of one year, instead of two or three years or even longer.

##### 5. The merits of the Bodhisattva

Bodhisattvas on the Path of Accumulation cultivate the four applications of mindfulness, the four correct abandonments, the four supports of miraculous ability, and the Four Sacred Seeds (Syllables?).

Entering the bodhisattva Path of Accumulation is like liberation, and it has very extraordinary merits.

We have not yet reached the Path of Accumulation, but we must also understand what a bodhisattva on the Path of Accumulation is.

After you understand it, when you rejoice in the merits and virtues, you will know what the bodhisattvas of the Path of Accumulation are doing and what they can do.

After understanding the merits and abilities of the Bodhisattva of the Accumulation Path, it is easy to develop true confidence in the Bodhisattva of the Accumulation Path.

If the Bodhisattva of the Path of Accumulation cultivates these methods, he will obtain the merits of the five supernatural powers and the five eyes.

##### (1) Five Supernormal Powers

**The Power of Celestial Vision**

The Divine Eye can see all things in the three thousand great thousand worlds and all sentient beings in the six realms clearly and distinctly. This is the supernormal vision of the Divine Eye.

**The Power of Celestial Hearing**

The sentient beings with the ears of the whole universe can understand what they say.

If the disciple has the Power of Celestial Hearing, the master is teaching the scriptures at Tuole Monastery, and the disciple can listen here, without having to go to the temple.

If both sides have the Power of Celestial Hearing, for example, Buddha Shakyamuni and Venerable Kasyapa had a dialogue, and the distance between them was more than 160 kilometers. Venerable Kasyapa asked the Buddha if he had any questions. Hearing it, and answering it immediately, this is the merit of The Power of Celestial Hearing.

The Power of Celestial Hearing can also hear the voices of the Land of Ultimate Bliss, the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas in various Pure Lands speak sutras, and the incarnations of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas can also hear the sutras.


**The Power of Discerning the Minds of Others**

He can understand clearly what everyone is thinking.

With his mind, it will be easy to teach the scriptures, and it will be able to cure the afflictions in the minds of the listeners, and by teaching the scriptures against his afflictions, the afflictions will be easily broken.

**The Power of Extinction of Suffering**

Spiritual change is also called body state, body wishful, and the body can be changed, and anything can be changed.

For example, the upper body is on fire, the lower body is frozen, walking in the air, sleeping in the air, etc.

**The Power of Knowing Past Lives**

Destiny can know other people and their own past lives.

When looking for a reincarnated soul-boy, only a master with the Power of Knowing Past Lives can find it.

##### (2) Five Eyes (Kinds of Vision)

Bodhisattvas who are on the path of accumulation not only obtain the merits of the five supernatural powers, but also have the five eyes.

The Five Eyes are the Physical eye, Heavenly eye, Wisdom eye, Dharma eye, and the Buddha eye.

**The Physical Eye** is called the naked eye, and the qualites of the bodhisattva's naked eye are divided into thirteen types.

The naked eye can see a hundred miles, the naked eye can see two hundred miles, the naked eye can see three hundred miles, the naked eye can see four hundred miles, the naked eye can see five hundred miles, and the naked eye can see a thousand miles.

The naked eye can see Jambudvipa continent, the naked eye can see two continents, the naked eye can see three continents, and the naked eye can see four continents.

The naked eye that can see one thousand thousand-fold worlds, the naked eye that can see two thousand thousand-fold worlds, and the naked eye that can see three thousand-fold universe.

**The Divine Eye** is the effortless ability to see the births and deaths of all beings in the three thousand-fold universe and is a result of the practice of meditation in past lives.

**The Wisdom Eye** understands emptiness,
sees the truth of dharmata and compare the merits after realizing emptiness.

If someone who has never been to Lhasa, listens to others talking about Lhasa, and thinks of Lhasa, it is a kind of comparison.

If you don't understand emptiness, you will understand it in your heart by listening to others talk about it. If you see Lhasa in person, you will understand it in person. The difference between emptiness and enlightenment is roughly like this.

When you have the eye of wisdom, you not only realize emptiness, but also understand the ten places of Bodhisattva and the fruition status of Buddha.

**The Dharma Eye**

The Dharma Eye is the knowledge of the Dharma of scripture (or transmission) and realization, and of the faculties of noble beings who possess this Dharma.

Fayan is the mastery of the three possessions.

56

**The Buddha Eye** 

The Buddha Eye is all knowledge, which is the primordial wisdom (yeshé) that sees all aspects of everything that can be known.

Bodhisattvas who are on the path of accumulation can also obtain the merits of Dharma joy.

After you get the Dharma, you can memorize all the Dharma you get, whether it’s in the past or this life, remembered or forgotten, and you will never forget it again.

If the master transmits the Tripitaka orally, the disciples can recite them naturally after they get the Dharma.

When the Bodhisattva attains the path of accumulation, he has not yet cut off his afflictions. He can only suppress them temporarily.

When the Lesser Stage of the path of accumulation is reached, it can suppress some afflictions; when the Intermediate Stage of the path of accumulation is reached, it can suppress the afflictions better; when the Greater Stage of the path of accumulation is reached, the ability to suppress the afflictions is greater.

Some Bodhisattvas who are on the Lesser Stage of the path of accumulation will have demonic obstacles and will fall into the three evil paths.

Some demons become his masters or benefactors and praise him every day. In this way, some bodhisattvas who are at the Lesser Stage of the path of accumulation will become arrogant or angry, and will slander other bodhisattvas.

At this time, their supernatural powers were not that great, and they could only see that the supernatural powers were lower than theirs, and it was impossible to tell which one was the Bodhisattva of Jiaxingdao and which one was the Bodhisattva of Destiny.

Because of the karma of slandering Bodhisattvas, these Bodhisattvas who are at the Lesser Stage of the path of accumulation will fall into the three evil realms.

A bodhisattva can fall into the three evil realms only by slandering the bodhisattva's karma. In addition, no karma will cause a bodhisattva to fall into the three evil realms, unless the bodhisattva's own vows, for example, are for the sake of saving sentient beings.

Starting from entering the Intermediate Stage of the path of accumulation, the bodhisattva will never fall into the evil path again.

**6. Right View of the Middle Way**

Starting from the Intermediate Stage of the path of accumulation, the ego is truly broken, and when the ego is broken, one realizes that people have no self.

There are two kinds of ego, the innate ego and the discriminating ego.

Practitioners start from the Intermediate Stage of the path of accumulation, and truly realize that people have no self and break their ego.

After the ego-clinging is broken, in terms of right view, one has reached the Intermediate Stage of the path of accumulation, that is, obtained the Right View of the Middle Way.

We illustrate this middle way figuratively in terms of Madhyamika.

There is a road, and on both sides of the road, there are cliffs. On one side there is a steep rock wall and on the other a very steep drop.

The rock wall is likened to "eternalism", and the steep drop is likened to "nihilism".

Most people will go to the extremes and will have various obsessions; there will also be a small number of people who do not believe in cause and effect and reincarnation, and will fall over the edge.

Ordinary living beings who do not fall into the extremes will fall into the extremes, and cannot walk the Middle Way, because we have not yet realized emptiness.

Take color for example.

Those who have fallen into the extremes think that since they say that form is emptiness, and that forms has no self-nature, it means that all things are empty, and emptiness means that there is nothing left.

58

What is the extreme? In Buddhism, materiality exists, but it has no self-nature. If one thinks that materiality exists, it has self-nature. Without self-nature, there is no way for it to exist. If you think this way, you have reached the extreme.

"Form is not different from emptiness" means that there is no boundary.

It means that materiality exists, but it has no self-nature, which is empty.

"Emptiness is not different from form" means that the self-nature of materiality is empty, but materiality exists, not that it does not exist.

"Form is emptiness" means that the form world is the original face of form, but we have never seen it because its nature is emptiness, and there is no self-nature.

"Emptiness is form" means that form without self-nature is the true face of form.

Materiality and emptiness of materiality are two sides of one body, so it is difficult to understand.

After the two sides are broken, the middle path is emptiness.

**Chapter 4 - Dharma of No-Self and the Bodhisattva's Additional Path**

"Sariputra is the emptiness of all dharmas"

The explicit meaning of this sutra is that the Dharma has no self, and the implicit meaning is that the Bodhisattva practices the Way, so let’s talk about the explicit meaning first.

Section 1 - law without me

Here is the "law without me".

This "dharma" is different from the Dharma in "Buddha, Dharma and Sangha", which here refers to all things in the universe, everything, and everything is the Dharma.

Emptiness is also Dharma, and everything is Dharma, so it is said that "all Dharmas and all things".

Law has no ego, even speech has no self-nature.

61

For example, a cup also has no self-nature, it is all dependent.

Dependent origination is cause and effect, and the birth and death of this cup also has cause and effect. Its cause has become it, and the current state is an effect.

If there is cause and effect, there is no self-nature.

A house also has a karmic origin. It needs to be built with bricks, cement and many other materials. The house itself has no self-nature, and it is all dharma without self.

We have not yet realized that there is no self in the dharma, so there will be dharma clinging and afflictions will arise.

For example, if you become attached to a cup, and the cup is broken, you will get angry.

Clinging to a flower will also cause all kinds of afflictions, fearing that it will wither due to lack of water, and worry if you water too much; if someone damages the flower, you will also get angry, and you will also get angry when you see more flowers. greedy.

These are all because of attachment to all things, and without attachment, there will be no greed.

Putting gold and silver treasures in front of horses and cattle will not cause them to become greedy, because they are not attached to gold and silver.

If you put gold and silver treasures in front of people, people will be tempted. This is law enforcement.

Faithful attachments will also bring us a lot of pain.

If you are obsessed with money, you will have a lot of afflictions in order to make money.

Being obsessed with physical health will also cause a lot of afflictions in this regard.

Attachment to what is painful or what, so we must cut off the Dharma and realize that the Dharma has no self.

62

The second section of the Bodhisattva's path

Jiaxingdao is to prepare for entering the way of seeing, and it is the advance of Path of Seeing.

At this time, the practitioner has already realized emptiness, and can practice both meditation and emptiness wisdom.

The Jiaxing Dao is divided into four levels: warm, top, forbearance, and the first method of the world.

Warming the road Warming the road is like drilling wood to make a fire. Everyone knows that before the fire starts, it must reach a certain temperature.

This means that in order to ignite the fire of realizing emptiness in the later stages, it is necessary to first reach the temperature of realizing emptiness in the warm-up stage.

When nuanjia practices the path, the bodhicitta possessed by practitioners is called fire bodhicitta. Why is it called fire bodhicitta? Beginning with the path of middle-grade resources, practitioners will realize emptiness and have the ability to meditate. They can enter into meditation to observe emptiness, and can stay in meditation at will.

However, before entering the Daxingdao, one cannot cultivate both meditation and wisdom in the process of concentration. Only when one obtains the Daoxingjiaxingdao can the dual cultivation of concentration and wisdom be possible.

The virtues of emptiness wisdom and meditation are like fire, which can burn away the hindrances of knowledge.

Burnout here refers to volts.

In this way, although the obstacles to the knowledge of the Bodhisattva Nuanjia Xingdao have not been broken, it seems that there are none. This is the power of fire Bodhicitta.

Dingjia Xingdao 

Dingjia Xingdao is the most extraordinary practice state in the world's good Dharma.

The Ninja practice Dao has reached the level of the Ninja practice Dao, no longer afraid of emptiness, able to endure emptiness, and not afraid of emptiness.

Before entering the path of ninja practice, if you are a practitioner with sharp roots, you will be very happy after realizing emptiness, as if you have found something that has been lost for a long time; if you are a practitioner with dull roots, you will be a little scared at this time. When the Fa is empty, you will find the "I" in the air, the "I" who has been clinging to and protecting every moment since beginningless time. This fear will soon disappear.

After entering the Ninjado, there will be no more fear.

At this time, he has already realized emptiness, and can endure the state of emptiness without fear.

The World's First Dharma Plus Practice Dao The world's first Dharma Plus practice Dao is also known as the Victory Plus Practice Dao. It is the most extraordinary of the Plus Practice Dao. At this time, it is time to prepare to enter the Dao of Seeing. When you cultivate to this level, you can enter the Dao of Seeing in an instant.

64

Section 3: The Dharma Door of Bodhisattva's Enhancing Path Practice
The main practice of the Jiaxing Dao is the five pure roots and five powers.

1. The Five Pure Roots
The Five Pure Roots are mainly the practice of the Nuanjia Path and the Top Path.

The five pure roots are faith, energy, mindfulness, concentration, and wisdom.

Faith in the roots is the unwavering belief in the Three Jewels.

When you reach the path of Jiaxing, you will not have any doubts about the Three Jewels, that is, you will have the root of faith.

The root of diligence is practice without slack.

When it comes to the path of practice, practitioners will be very diligent day and night, even when they are sleeping, they are practising, and they are contemplating emptiness in their dreams. This is the root of energy.

Mindfulness means cutting off delusional thoughts and gaining righteous thoughts.

When the Bodhisattva followed the path, he would never forget the Dharma he had heard before.

In ordinary life, what the master said can be clearly understood. This is to have the root of mindfulness.

The root of concentration is to cut off the obstacles of meditation and be able to enter into concentration at all times.

The Bodhisattva on the Accumulation Path sometimes has some slack and slack, and there will be no more after entering the Path of Accomplishment.

Wisdom Root Wisdom Root is able to distinguish between good and evil.

After the Bodhisattva who practiced the path came out of concentration, Biliang realized emptiness and understood the true face of things.

The false appearance of things is broken, and everything is seen as an illusion or a dream.

As the Diamond Sutra says:

All conditioned dharmas are like dream bubbles, dew and electricity, and should be viewed in this way.

2. Five Forces
The five powers are the main practice of the Bodhisattva of the Dao of Ninja and the World's No. 1 Dharma.

The five powers are Faith, Diligence, Mindfulness, Concentration, and Wisdom.

Faith is the greatest countermeasure against unbelief. Starting from faith, the afflictions of unbelief can be completely eliminated.

Some people doubt the Three Jewels and cling to wrong views. After seeing the Bodhisattva of Jiaxingdao who is full of faith, their doubts about the Three Jewels will naturally be eliminated, and they will realize that their previous concepts were wrong.

Most of the people who met my master, Dharma King Yongzeng, believed in the Buddhadharma because they were influenced by Dharma King's faith.

66

Diligent force Diligent force is the most excellent way to deal with laziness.

When Bodhisattva Jiaxing Dao began to cultivate his energy, in order to save sentient beings, his practice would be very diligent, and he would no longer be lazy, and even sentient beings who saw Bodhisattva Jiaxing Dao would be diligent along with them.

Mindfulness Mindfulness is the greatest antidote to delusions.

When Bodhisattva Jiaxingdao starts to cultivate his mindfulness, his delusional thoughts will become less and less, and the delusional thoughts that occasionally arise will not hinder his practice. Sentient beings who see the Bodhisattva who cultivate mindfulness will also suppress their delusional thoughts.

Concentration Concentration is the greatest antidote to sluggishness and drowsiness.

Beginning with concentration, the Four Noble Truths of the Bodhisattva Jiaxingdao is very extraordinary, and there is almost no slack and drowsiness at all times.

If apathy and drowsiness arise, it does not obstruct the path.

When you see a Bodhisattva with concentration, because of the Bodhisattva's vows and concentration, all beings around you will naturally calm down.

Wisdom is the greatest antidote of tainted wisdom.

The main function of wisdom power is to eliminate ignorance and afflictions, and it can choose and reject according to the Four Noble Truths.

According to the wisdom and vows of the Bodhisattva, the people around the Bodhisattva will naturally grow in wisdom.

67

The fourth section of the merits of the Bodhisattva
From the time of entering the path of the kagyo, the cultivator's achievement has been very high.

At this time, practitioners are practicing even in their sleep.

During The Intermediate Stage material road, the practice in dreams is sometimes absent, while the high-grade material road is spent practicing most of the time in the dream.

Ever since he entered the Kagyo path, he has been practicing in his dreams.

Beginning with the Path of Addition, if you want to do the Dharma to increase your interest and increase your heart, you don’t need to recite rituals or hold pujas. You just need to think about it in your heart, and you can achieve it with your vows and concentration.

For example, when you see where there is a fire, you only need to make a wish in your heart: if the fire is extinguished, the fire will be extinguished with the power of your vow.

Earthquakes and plagues occur, and these disasters can be stopped with the practitioner's will or concentration.

In terms of saving sentient beings, if the Bodhisattva Jiaxingdao wants to teach the Dharma, among the people who listen to the Dharma, at least 80 people can get the training of the Dharma. ; The words of the Buddha's sermons are 100% effective.

A master without bodhicitta can teach sutras to a hundred people, and can save two or three people, which is already very good.

Saving sentient beings is the most difficult, and this is where the difficulties of the masters are, because many sentient beings have heavy karma and great afflictions.

A Bodhisattva who practiced the Dao, even if he did dirty work for a hundred years and did not take a bath for a hundred years, his body and clothes would still be clean, and the dust would not stick to his clothes.

No bacteria, no lice, no cockroaches following him, no mosquitoes biting him.

Jiaxingdao Bodhisattva's heart is very straight, and he has no scheming.

Being scheming is also a kind of trouble, and starting from Jiaxingdao, there will be no such afflictions anymore.

Bodhisattvas who practice the path are not stingy, and all things can be donated.

If you are a monk, you can donate everything except your robe.

If a bodhisattva who is practicing the path has a building, someone goes to ask: "Bodhisattva, please give me the house."

This Bodhisattva will definitely give it to him, giving him a house is like giving a steamed bun, and he will not be stingy at all.

The Bodhisattva of the Path of Accumulation is sometimes deceived by demonic obstacles, and cannot be completely distinguished. Some demons will become the Bodhisattva's own master, or become a Buddha to deceive the Bodhisattva of the Path of Accumulation.

Beginning with the Kagyo Way, with the growth of the bodhisattva's ability, there is no way to deceive anymore.

There was a master in Qinghai named Zagar Ninba, who once went to Xiaqiong Temple.

During that period, Xiaqiong Monastery had a demon barrier, and several lamas died every year.

Xiaqiong Temple is on a mountain. When he reached the mountainside, a lot of rainbows suddenly appeared in the sky, and the thirty-seven Buddhas of the Great Sun Tathagata appeared in the rainbow light. He thought: This time I finally saw the Buddha.

Think about it again, I haven't obtained the achievement of the sustenance, how can the Great Sun Tathagata appear here? He immediately meditated with the Seven Ways of Vairocana, and then looked at it, the Great Sun Tathagata was gone, it turned out to be demonized.

When meditating, use the posture of the Seven Dharma of Vairocana, because of the power of Vairocana Buddha's vows, no matter how powerful a demon can stand.

Cultivators, starting from the Jiaxing Dao, will understand all about demonic obstacles and will no longer be confused by demonic obstacles.

Relying on the power of realizing emptiness, Jiaxingdao Bodhisattva can subdue gross afflictions and obstacles of knowledge. Although the obstacles to afflictions and obstacles of knowledge have not been eliminated, they will not cause afflictions.

If someone wants to make Bodhisattva Jiaxingdao troubled, and beats and scolds him every day, he will still be very happy and will not cause afflictions. Even the devil of the Son of Heaven cannot hinder the Bodhisattva of Jiaxingdao.

There is a story that many emperors and demons chatted together, and one emperor said that I have an enemy.

The other emperors and demons said, what is that, we have tens of thousands of enemies.

The first emperor said that your enemies are all ordinary people, you can take revenge, and you can annoy them.

My enemy is a Bodhisattva, and I have no way to trouble him.

When sentient beings encounter a great disaster, the Bodhisattva who practiced the path thinks that the suffering of sentient beings will be sad, and a little trouble may arise in the process.

70

Other than that, no defilements arise.

Once you get the way of adding practice, the merit will be incredible.

If a person makes offerings of the Seven Treasures, the Eight Offerings, and the Eight Auspicious Treasures every day for thousands of years to make offerings to the same number of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas as the number of sentient beings in the three thousand great thousand worlds, the merits and virtues of the Bodhisattvas of the Jiaxing Dao are the same with one finger.

After we understand the practice and merits of Bodhisattva Jiaxingdao, although we can’t practice like Bodhisattva Jiaxingdao, we can rejoice in the practice and merits of Bodhisattva Jiaxingdao, and we can also cultivate the roots of faith in Bodhisattva Jiaxingdao.

You can make a vow, for example, make a vow to be the same as the Bodhisattva of Jiaxingdao, use faith to strengthen people; or make a vow to be as diligent as the Bodhisattva of the Jiaxingdao, and no longer be lazy.

In this way, it is okay to have a heart, it is better to have a heart, and it is very important to have a heart.

Before going to bed, you can make a vow: "I want to be like the Bodhisattva of the Path of Accumulation, I can practice in my dreams, and I must practice."

Even if you don't practice in your dreams, or even have many nightmares, you still have merit.

Chapter 5 The Bodhisattva Path of Seeing

"Not born, not destroyed, not defiled, not pure, not increased nor decreased"

This verse expressly speaks of the profound emptiness.

The eight dharmas of emptiness are non-generation, non-destruction, constant and non-permanent, non-come and non-going, non-uniform and non-differentiated. sex.

The hidden meaning is about the Bodhisattva in the five Mahayana ways.

**Section 1 - The difference between suppressing afflictions and breaking afflictions**

When the Bodhisattva of Clear Discernment begins the Path of Seeing, he must cut off his afflictions and obstacles.

There are two kinds of afflictions, namely afflictions and inborn afflictions.

The afflictions of separation are the afflictions imagined in this life.

In our life, under the influence of society and the world around us, especially the influence of books, newspapers, media, etc., we will have all kinds of delusions, which will cause us to have afflictions.

The affliction that the Bodhisattva wants to break when he reaches the Path of Seeing is the affliction of separation.

Innate afflictions are the afflictions that have been born and died together with us since beginningless time, and are reincarnated together. They are the afflictions brought about by previous lives.

There are two types of knowledge obstacles, namely knowledge obstacles and innate knowledge obstacles.

As we have said before, the "I" that seeks and settles on the five aggregates, whether it is settled on the five aggregates as a whole, or is settled separately, any "I" settled on the five aggregates can be said to be the hindrance of distinguishing knowledge.

Innate knowledge obscurity is the ignorance that has followed us since beginningless time.

What needs to be broken on the path of seeing is the barrier of discernment and knowledge, and what needs to be broken when on the path of meditation is the barrier of inborn afflictions and the barrier of inborn knowledge.

Once the two types of obstacles are removed, those who practice Mahayana Buddhism become Buddhas, and those who practice Hinayana become Arhats.

Therefore, to get rid of obstacles and afflictions one must be at the stage of the path of seeing or the path of meditation.

The afflictions cannot be cut off during the path of accumulation, and  afflictions can only be subdued; the same can’t be broken during the path of joining, but afflictions can be suppressed thoroughly.

When a bodhisattva reaches the path of no-more-learning, he does not need to cut off the afflictions and obstacles, because they have already cut them off.

The Lesser Stage of the path of accumulation can suppress a small number of afflictions; the Intermediate Stage can suppress most of the afflictions; the Greater Stage can suppress the afflictions more strongly.

74

When the Bodhisattva followed the path, although he did not cut off the afflictions, he was able to suppress all the afflictions.

Therefore, Bodhisattvas or Shravakas who practice the path seem to have no afflictions at all, but they are not. They temporarily suppress afflictions completely and completely.

Once, Buddha Shakyamuni went to the Nilian Chan River in India. At that time, there were more than 500 outsiders by the Nilian Chan River. Their meditation practice was very high, and they obtained the eighth concentration of the four meditations and eight meditations. This state does not cut off the afflictions, but relies on the power of meditation to temporarily suppress the afflictions, and it feels as if the afflictions are gone.

When these outsiders saw Shakyamuni, they thought, Shakyamuni has no afflictions, and neither do we; when Shakyamuni cut off our afflictions, we also cut off our afflictions, it’s just that Shakyamuni’s supernatural powers are a little bigger.

They have such a misunderstanding, why is that? Because the power of meditation completely subdues the defilements, they feel as if they have no defilements.

After a long time out of concentration, with the weakening of concentration, defilements will gradually arise.

There was an out-of-the-way meditator who obtained the highest meditation and stayed in it for twenty or thirty years.

After leaving the meditation, he saw that his hair was very long and dragged to the ground. He thought, I have been in the meditation for so long, and he felt a little arrogant.

I continued to meditate, and after a few days, I was very angry when I saw a mouse nest in my hair.

In this case, the afflictions are not cut off. If the afflictions are cut off, a rat's nest will not make him angry.

Many people who practice meditation, when they reach a certain level, feel that their afflictions are cut off and they will no longer have afflictions. This is actually a misunderstanding.

Section 2 Bodhisattva sees the way
There are three types of Bodhisattva's way of seeing: the way of breaking the way, the way of seeing liberation, and the way of Path of Seeing.

"Not born, not destroyed, not defiled, not pure, not increased nor decreased" , mainly talks about the way of judgment and view.

1. Path of Seeing

The way of breaking the view is also called the way of uninterrupted view. When the way of breaking the view is broken, one can realize the emptiness in meditation.

After the realization of emptiness, there is still some vagueness. It is not clear, or it is compared to the realization of emptiness, but it is only abstractly understood. The realization of emptiness is a complete and thorough realization of emptiness.

76

There are eight different stages of the Way of Duan Duanjian. These eight stages are: Wisdom of Suffering, Wisdom of Suffering, Wisdom of Accumulation, Wisdom of Collection, Wisdom of Extermination, Wisdom of Elimination, Wisdom of Dao , Dharma class wisdom.

These eight stages all pass in an instant, an instant.

How long is an instant? The Jingbu faction thinks it is one-sixtieth of a finger snap, and the Madhyamika thinks it is three-hundred-sixtieth of a finger snap.

The Bodhisattva realized emptiness in the first moment of severing the path of view. Let us explain these eight stages separately.

Wisdom of the Dharma of Suffering and Wisdom of Suffering Kinds of Wisdom have realized the emptiness of the truth of suffering, and cut off the cognition barrier of attachment to the truth of suffering.

At the time of Ji Dharma Wisdom-Forbearance and Ji-Class Wisdom Forbearance, the emptiness of Ji-truth is realized and the knowledge obstacle of Ji-truth attachment is broken.

When the Wisdom of Ending Dharma and the Wisdom of Ending Kinds are realized, the emptiness of the truth of extinction is realized, and the cognition barrier of attachment to the truth of extinction is broken.

When Dao-fa wisdom-forbearance and Dao-like wisdom-forbearance are realized, the emptiness of the truth of the Dharma is realized, and the cognition obstacle of the attachment to the truth of the Dharma is broken.

In these eight moments, he clearly realized the emptiness of the Four Noble Truths of the Path to the Cessation of Suffering.

In this kind of meditation, there is no longer the path to the cessation of suffering, and at the same time, all obstacles to discernment will be cut off.

The real eradication of afflictions and knowledge obstacles is at the Path of Seeing and cultivating the Way.

What needs to be broken when reaching the Path of Seeing are the barrier of discrimination. From the moment of entering the Path of Seeing, practitioners must remove the barrier of afflictions and knowledge, and it is no longer a temporary suppression.

There are one hundred and twelve obstacles of discrimination.

Each of the Four Noble Truths of the Desire Realm has ten afflictions: greed, hatred, ignorance, arrogance, doubt, wrong views, bad views, marginal views, precepts and prohibitions, and views.

There is no anger in the form realm and the formless realm. Therefore, the four truths of the form realm and the formless realm each have thirty-six kinds of affliction obstacles.

In this way, there are a total of 112 kinds of afflictions of discrimination in the Three Realms.

The Path of Seeing fundamentally cuts off bad gatherings, doubts, and prohibitions.

"Bad meeting" is to separate the ego.

"Doubt" means to doubt the Three Treasures, cause and effect.

"Forbidden to take view" is to take the non-Dharma as the Dharma, take the non-right way as the right way, and treat the non-right Dharma as the right Dharma.

These three kinds of afflictions will obstruct practice and obstruct liberation.

"Cut off the afflictions" means that even if the various causes and conditions that cause afflictions are met in the future, afflictions will not arise again.

It's like burning and breaking the seeds of trouble, and no matter how much water you water, they won't sprout.

The Madhyamika Self-tantra School believes that the seeds of afflictions are the habit of afflictions. Although afflictions are cut off, the seeds of afflictions have not been broken, because habitual afflictions of afflictions are obstacles to knowledge.

The Madhyamika Prasanghika School believes that habitual of affliction is affliction, and when affliction is cut off, the habit of affliction will be cut off.

78

There are a total of one hundred and eight obstacles to discernment, and there are thirty-six obstacles to discernment in the desire, form, and formless realms.

As soon as one reaches the Path of Seeing, the hindrances of discriminating afflictions and discriminating knowledge is immediately cut off.

As soon as the sun rising to the realization of emptiness, the darkness of the obscurity of knowledge is suddenly gone.

In the meditation of cutting off the Path of Seeing, the obstacle of innate knowledge is also gone, but it has not been cut off.

Adding one affliction will bring great pain, cutting off one affliction will bring great joy, and cutting off two afflictions will bring even greater happiness.

Therefore, it can be said that the happiness of all ordinary people below the path of practice is not as good as the happiness of a Bodhisattva on the Path of Seeing who has broken the obstacles to distinguishing afflictions and distinguishing knowledge.

The Bodhisattva at this time can be counted as part of the Arya Sangha in the Three Jewels, Bodhisattvas on the Path of Accumulation and the Path of Joining can not be counted as the Sangha, and the Hinayana is also considered as one of the Three Jewels when the Way of Seeing is above. Monk treasure.

Some people do not know what a monk is.

Once, when I was talking about the Four Refuges, a disciple said, "Master, I have no problem taking refuge in the Guru, the Buddha, or the Dharma, but I find it difficult for me to take refuge in the Sangha."

I asked why and he said that there are so many fake monks now.

79

We can now understand that the "take refuge in the Sangha" does not refer to ordinary monks, but the Arya Sangha of the Three Jewels.

Only monks who have cultivated to the level of the Path of Seeing can be regarded as the treasures of monks, and those below the level of enlightenment must have more than four monks to represent the treasures of monks, but they are not the treasures of monks in the true sense.

2. Seeing the Dao, liberating and seeing the Dao

After the obstacle of discriminating afflictions and discriminating knowledge has been cut off, the bodhisattva still lives in the emptiness and concentration.

There are eight stages of seeing the path and liberation: the wisdom of suffering, the wisdom of suffering, the wisdom of gathering, the wisdom of gathering, the wisdom of cessation, the wisdom of extinction, the wisdom of Dharma, and the wisdom of Dharma.

After entering the emptiness of the truth of dukkha, you will be liberated from the obstacles of clinging to the truth of dukkha.

After entering into the emptiness of the truth of origin, and from the obstructed knowledge of attachment to the truth of origin, you will be liberated, and you will have attained the knowledge of the dharma of origin and the knowledge of the type of origin.

After entering the emptiness of the truth of extinction, you will be liberated from the obstacles of knowing that you are attached to the truth of extinction, and you will attain the wisdom of extinction and the wisdom of extinction.

After entering into the emptiness of the truth of the Dharma, you will be liberated from the obstacles of knowing that you are attached to, and you will attain the wisdom of the law of the Dharma and the wisdom of the Dharma.

80

3. Obtain the Dharma after seeing the Taoist position

After the Bodhisattva on the Path of Seeing emerges from the meditation of emptiness, he sees all things as a dream and an illusion. The way to obtain this kind of enlightenment is to obtain the Dao after seeing the position of the Dao.

After seeing the position of the Dharma and attaining the Dharma, the Bodhisattva can practice and uphold the merits of the mundane truth.

4. Ultimate Truth and Worldly Truth

In Buddhism, all dharmas, including samsara and nirvana, are divided into two levels of truth: ultimate truth and mundane truth.

"Truth" is the meaning of truth. Simply put, the ultimate truth is the pure and real realm that can be seen by the mind of the sage, and emptiness is the ultimate truth. Realm, all things under the sky are worldly truths.

When a bodhisattva reaches the Path of Seeing, he will enter into the meditation of emptiness. In this samadhi, only the ultimate truth of emptiness can be seen, and there is no joke about the worldly truth.

Everything is a mundane truth, and the "non-birth" of "non-birth and non-destruction" means that the "birth" of all dharmas and all things has no self-nature.

That is to say, in the samadhi of the Bodhisattva Path of Seeing, he can only see the emptiness of birth, "non-birth", that is, there is no birth, and he cannot see birth and death.

81

We have said that the self-nature is always at ease.

Chang means eternal and unchanging. In fact, there is no such thing as eternal life. Life and death are impermanent, and all life is impermanent, so life has no self-nature.

"One" means being alone and independent. If life is independent, it should have no weight, but life also has the weight of earth, water, fire, and wind, so there is no birth of "one", and there is no birth of freedom.

"Not dirt is not clean", dirt is dirty, not clean.

Dirt and pure have no self-nature either.

In the samadhi of the Bodhisattva Path of Seeing, you can't see dirt and purity, but only the emptiness of dirt and purity. Everything has emptiness, the sky has its emptiness, and impermanence also has its emptiness. Samadhi In it, only emptiness can be seen, and no mundane truth can be seen. The same is true of "no increase, no decrease".

To put it simply, in the samadhi where the Bodhisattva sees the Dharma, he is far away from the mundane truth and cannot see the mundane truth.

Why is this so? Before attaining Buddhahood, without attaining all the universal wisdom, only one of the ultimate truth or the mundane truth can be seen.

When you see the mundane truth, you can't see the ultimate truth, and when you see the ultimate truth, you can't see the mundane truth. Only when you become a Buddha can you see the two truths at the same time.

What we see and know now is the mundane truth.

We do not understand the ultimate truth, we have not realized the ultimate truth.

If you realize the ultimate truth and get the ultimate meditation meditation, you will not see the mundane truth, because the ultimate truth is far away from the jokes of the mundane truth.

Failure to see mundane truth does not mean that mundane truth does not exist.

In the meditation of emptiness, because of the power of emptiness, the mundane truth cannot be seen or found.

Only after seeing the Dao Bodhisattva come out of concentration can we see the worldly truth.

When you leave the time, you can see the true face of the mundane truth, just like the person in the mirror, all have no self-nature, but they exist. Therefore, the mundane truth is also a kind of real law.

5. Seven Factors of Awakening

A Bodhisattva on the Path of Seeing mainly practices the Seven Factors of Awakening, sometimes translated as the seven points of enlightenment.

The Seven Factors of Awakening are: Mindfulness, Investigation, Energy, Joy, Tranquility, Concentration, and Equanimity.

Mindfulness of bodhichitta is the root of enlightenment that can fix other bodhisattva as immovable in the object.

Joy or rapture, investigation, and energy are to be developed when experiencing sloth and torpor. Relaxation, concentration, and equanimity are to be developed when experiencing restlessness or worry. Mindfulness should be constantly present to remain aware of physical change as well as mental change.

Investigation (investigation-of-states or discernment of phenomena) - begins with seeing the nature of phenomena, thoroughly understanding emptiness, and can obtain more thorough wisdom, and wisdom can break obstacles.

Energy (diligence) - The energy of this factor of awakening can continuously increase the Bodhisattva's status as a bodhisattva.

Most of us see that it takes a long time to become a Buddha, and we need to accumulate a lot of good fortune. If we feel that we cannot do it, we will become lazy.

Bodhisattvas will not do this. Even if the kalpas of the total amount of sand in the universe are counted as one day, thirty days are one month, and twelve months are one year, and only in the time calculated in this way can one become a Buddha, the Bodhisattva will not be lazy, and will always be able to attain Buddhahood. With energy and hard work, faith will not retreat until you become a Buddha.

If you attain the element of Joy, you will be very happy in all of your practice.

From the moment of entering the path of seeing, the bodhisattva can give to his own body.

At this time, even if his hand is cut off, he will be happy, there is no unhappiness.

Ordinary Bodhisattvas below the Dao level can't give their bodies, because they haven't obtained the element of Joy, and they will feel pain.

When suffering, you will regret giving your body, you will lose the merit of giving, and your body will be wasted in vain.

One day, Venerable Atisha saw a man on the street with a strange disease, and wanted to save him.

He said that the disease could not be cured. The doctor said that it could only be cured by eating human flesh.

The Venerable Atisha thought, this is an opportunity for me to give myself to save a sentient being, so he cut a piece of flesh from his body and gave it to the man, then fainted from the pain.

When His Holiness Atisha woke up and saw that the patient was healed, he was very happy and felt that he had helped him a lot.

A greatly accomplished person like Venerable Atisha can make a gift of the body. Ordinary people who donate the body will regret it 100% of the time, so it is not easy to give the body.

There are people in China who like to burn their fingers to make an offering to Buddha. If they can do it without regret, they can do it.

But in Tantra, this is absolutely forbidden, because there are many meridians on the fingers. When practicing the Tantra of the second class, all the Qi channels in the entire body must be repaired, and even a little scar on the body will cause obstacles.

Therefore, Tantra requires that the body should not be harmed and must be well protected.

Pliancy -
At this time, the Bodhisattva's body is very light, and some can even fly around.

To be able to fly one does not necessarily have to reach the path of seeing. Not only Buddhists, but also some outsiders have this kind of supernatural power, and some can also fly by relying on incantations and medicinal talismans.

But here it only refers to the bodhisattvas who have attained the light body of peace, or pliancy of body.

When the Bodhisattva with the element of Pliancy enters into samadhi, apart from his own power of vows and Buddha power, neither sentient beings nor the ruthless world can be disturbed, and his mind can stay focused, without being distracted, and without vexation and delusion.

The equanimity of the Bodhisattva means to abandon all distinctions, to be equal to things, and to have an unbiased mind.

The samadhi obtained by a Bodhisattva on the Path of Seeing is very happy, but he will give up this kind of happiness, and no matter how great the happiness is, he will not be greedy.

The Seven Factors of Awakening of the Bodhisattva Path of Seeing are like the seven treasures of the wheel-turning holy king.

Mindfulness is like a wheel treasure, which can counteract unbroken obstacles; Investigation is like an elephant treasure, which can eliminate the discriminating mind of the enemy; Energy is like a horse treasure, which can promote all things to be accomplished quickly; Joy ​​is like wishful thinking. Treasures can fill practitioners with Dharma joy and wish fulfillment; Tranquility is like the Queen's treasure, which can make practitioners happy in body and mind; Concentration (samadhi) is like the treasure of the head of the household, which can make practitioners' merits and virtues at ease and wishful luck; Equanimity is like the treasure of ministers, It can make the traveler's heart not delay, and his wishes come true.

6. Seeing the virtues of Bodhisattva

The Bodhisattva on the Path of Seeing, he can see the Buddha. The Buddha's body is originally a light body of consciousness and wisdom. Before reaching the Path of Seeing, the naked eye cannot see the Buddha.

Bodhisattvas who have reached the Path of Seeing and above can see the Buddha's thirty-two excellent marks, and the eighty solemn appearances of the sambhogakaya.

When the Bodhisattva reaches the path of seeing, he can fly to the Buddha's Pure Land.

Those who can fly to the Pure Land do not necessarily reach the position of seeing the Dao. In the past, there were several great virtues who practiced the dakini tantra in Tibet and brought their bodies to the Pure Land, but they did not reach the path of seeing.

Seeing that a Bodhisattva in the Taoist position can turn an instant blessing into a hundred kalpas, and a hundred kalpas can be turned into an instant.

In the past, there was a 16-year-old lama in Sera Monastery in Lhasa who went to the mountains behind Drepung Monastery to find cow dung for making a fire.

Many practitioners meditated in the caves behind Drepung Monastery. When the young lama was out looking for cow dung, an old lama came out of the cave and asked him to come and drink tea.

They drank milk tea and chatted for a day. At sunset, the young lama said, "I've been chatting with you all day. I haven't collected the cow dung yet. I'm going back."

The old lama said, where are you going now? He said that I would go to Sera Monastery. The old Lama said, you have no home in Sera Monastery anymore. The young Lama said, "How can there be no home for me? I want to go back."

The old lama said, "You should just stay, it has been a long time, and there is no home for you in Sera Monastery."

The young lama did not understand what he was talking about, so he went back to the Sera Monastery.

The young lama returned to Sera Monastery and found that the entire monastery had changed. He was very surprised.

When he got home, he found an old lama living there, and he said to the old lama, "Why are you in my house?"

The old lama said that this was his home, and they started arguing about it.

The old lama said "My master lived in this house and left the house to me after he passed away. This room has been around for more than 100 years."

The young lama asked "How is this possible? I went out only this morning, and I have just got back."

The two continued to quarrel, and the other lamas didn't like it when they heard the quarrel. A 116-year-old old lama heard about the incident and said he wanted to see them. The old lama was surprised when he saw the young lama, because this old Lama and this young Lama were the same age, from the same place, and they were good friends in the past.

He said to the young lama: "You went missing a hundred years ago. The lamas of the entire Sera Monastery went to look for you, and the old lama who took care of you also looked for you for a few years. No one knew where you were and thought you were dead. We chant mantras for you too.

It turned out that the old lama who lived in the cave behind the Drepung Monastery was a great siddha named Dolungwa Osai Dorje, who had compressed one hundred years into one day.

From the moment of seeing the Bodhisattva on the Taoist position, with such merits, one can bless a moment for a hundred years, or even thousands of years.

Seeing the supernatural powers of a Bodhisattva in the Taoist position can see the birth and death of a hundred kalpas.

You can clearly see how the world has changed before and after a hundred eons.

In the moment of seeing a Bodhisattva, he can transform into a hundred incarnations; save a hundred sentient beings; teach a hundred kinds of Dharma; enter a hundred different kinds of meditation;

The great achiever Dolongwa Osai Dorje mentioned earlier did not pass away. He is one of the three famous vajras of the Gelug School. None of the three vajras has passed away, and those who are destined will meet them.

Master Ben Gongjia of Kadampa did not pass away either, and he was seen before.

To meet a Bodhisattva on the Path of Seeing or above, you need a lot of good fortune.

My disciple Sonam Gyatso and I went to the back mountain of Drepung Monastery, and wanted to go to the cave where Gyalm Dang Shepa retreated to worship. The master had retreated in that cave for thirty-two years.

We met a layman in the cave. He said his name was Dolong Tashi. He lived in this cave for a long time and recited the Four Refuges tens of millions of times. I saw a thin quilt on the kang. What else? No, life seems to be hard.

I recited the six-syllable mantra 10,000 times in this cave, and then went around to worship.

Then we sat down and chatted with him. He gave me a copy of "Liberation in the Palm of your Hand" and said that printing this book would bring great benefits to all beings. I was very happy and brought the book back.

After I came back, I told Master Sangpo about this. He was surprised and said that the cave was empty and he had just been there the day before yesterday.

Hearing Master Sangpo say this, I also felt a little strange. The next day, a lama was sent there. The lama came back and said that there was no one in the cave, nothing.

If he was a great achiever, we ordinary people would not recognize him.

After I came back, I printed out the book he sent and gave it to the masters from all over the Tibetan area.

There is still such a thing in Tibet now. It is said that Bodhisattvas who have reached the path of seeing or above, some have not passed away, and they live somewhere.

For them, wherever they are is bliss.

Moon called Bodhisattva

##### Chapter 6 The Bodhisattva Cultivation

"Therefore, there is no form, no feeling, thoughts, actions, consciousness, no eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, mind, no form, body, fragrance, touch, and Dharma".

In the emptiness meditation of the Bodhisattva, there is only the emptiness of the ultimate truth, and there is no mundane truth.

There is no form, feeling, thought, action, and consciousness, no eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, or mind, no form, sound, smell, taste, touch, or things.

The hidden meaning is to talk about Mahayana Bodhisattva cultivating the way.

The moment when you realize emptiness, you will see the Dharma at the beginning. The time for the Bodhisattva to see the Dharma will be a little longer, because you need to accumulate a lot of merit, and the moment of seeing the Dharma in the Hinayana is over.

Beginning with the removal of the obstacles of co-birth knowledge, the Bodhisattva enters the Path of Seeing.

##### Section 1 - of the bodhisattva practice

Bodhisattvas of the first bhumi to of the tenth bhumi belong to Taoism.

Therefore, there are different levels of cultivation, from the cultivation of a bodhisattva of the first bhumi, a bodhisattva of the second bhumi, a bodhisattva of the third bhumi, up to the cultivation of a bodhisattva of the tenth bhumi.

The afflictions that are broken during the cultivation stage are the innate afflictions, and the knowledge that is broken is also the innate afflictions.

There are three types of large, large and medium, large and medium, and large and small.

There are three types of medium, medium and large, medium and medium, and medium and small.

There are three categories of small, the large in the small, the medium in the small, and the small in the small.

Among them, the smallest small, medium and small are further divided into small and medium, large and small.

Small and medium.

In this way, it is divided into ten obstacles of innate afflictions and obstacles of innate knowledge, and each one of them will increase by a fruition: The Bodhisattva of the first land should cut off the obstacles of great innate afflictions and obstacles of innate knowledge.

The Bodhisattva of the Second Ground must cut off the obstacles of innate afflictions and obstacles of innate knowledge in the great and middle.

92

The bodhisattvas of the three grounds must cut off the obstacles of co-born afflictions and obstacles of co-born knowledge.

The bodhisattvas of the four grounds must cut off the great inborn afflictions and the inborn knowledge obstacles in the middle.

The Bodhisattvas of the Five Grounds must break off the obstacles of inborn afflictions and obstacles of innate knowledge.

Sixth-earth bodhisattvas, we must cut off the middle and small obstacles of inborn afflictions and obstacles of innate knowledge.

The Bodhisattvas of the Seven Grounds must cut off the great inborn afflictions and the inborn knowledge obstacles of the small and medium.

The Bodhisattva of the Eighth Ground must cut off the obstacles of inborn afflictions and obstacles of innate knowledge in the small and medium.

The Bodhisattva of the Nine Grounds, we must cut off the great inborn afflictions and the inborn knowledge obstacles in the small and small.

The bodhisattvas of the ten grounds must break the small and small obstacles of inborn afflictions and obstacles of innate knowledge.

After Path of Seeing Bodhisattva has cut off the obstacles of discriminating afflictions and discriminating knowledge, he can only ascend to the position of cultivation in the meditation of emptiness.

The Madhyamika Self-Continuing School believes that the Bodhisattva from one place to ten places can only ascend to the throne when he is in meditation, and when the Bodhisattva of ten places attains the Buddha position, he also needs to be in meditation to realize the great Bodhi.

The Middle Way Yingcheng School believes that a bodhisattva below the eighth level is the way to cut off the afflictions, and only when the eighth level or above is above can cut off the obstacles of knowledge; when a bodhisattva in one place sees the way, he will cut off one hundred and twelve obstacles to distinguish afflictions and one hundred obstacles. Zero and eight are known to each other.

The Bodhisattva's way of cultivating the way includes the way of severance and the way of liberation.

Abandoning the cultivation of the Dharma can break the obstacles of innate afflictions and obstacles of innate knowledge.

All the Bodhisattvas from the first realm to the tenth realm are in the position of cultivation.

Among them, the Bodhisattva of the first land is divided into the Bodhisattva of the first place to see the way and the Bodhisattva of the first place to cultivate the way.

Bodhisattvas who have ascended to the earth should cultivate the ten prajna: generosity, precepts, patience, diligence, meditation, wisdom, vows, convenience, strength, and wisdom.

Bodhisattvas from one place to ten places must cultivate these ten paramitas.

In addition to cultivating the ten paramitas, the Bodhisattva of the First Land should especially practise the paramitas of generosity.

Before the practitioners reach the Bodhisattva in one place, some cannot give, such as their own body, their own children, relatives and friends, etc.

From the beginning, the Bodhisattva can give anything he wants to give without any regrets.

If you are a monk, you cannot donate your own cassock.

When the Bodhisattva in the second place is cultivating the ten paramitas, he especially needs to practice the paramita of the precepts. The bodhisattva from the second place will not break the precepts even in a dream.

The bodhisattvas of the third bhumi especially need to practice forbearance and humiliation Paramita.

Starting from the third bhumi, the bodhisattva's ability to endure humiliation is very strong. If all the sentient beings in the three thousand great thousand worlds become the enemy of the bodhisattva and trouble him together, he will not be troubled.

What the bodhisattvas of the four realms need to cultivate is the paramita of diligence. At this time, the bodhisattvas are so diligent that they are not lazy even in their dreams.

What the Bodhisattvas of the fifth bhumi should cultivate in particular is the meditation Paramita.

It is inconceivable that the Bodhisattva of the fifth bhumi can enter and exit millions of different meditations in an instant.

What the Bodhisattvas of the Sixth bhumi need to cultivate in particular is the Paramita of Wisdom.

Starting from the Sixth bhumi, the wisdom of the bodhisattva will be very vast, the wisdom of the two truths will gradually be perfected, and the wisdom of the mundane truth will surpass that of an arhat.

What the Bodhisattvas of the Seventh bhumi need to cultivate in particular is the convenient paramita.

There are two kinds of convenient paramitas: the convenience of saving sentient beings and the convenience of cultivating Buddhahood.

Bodhisattvas in the seventh bhumi or above will not have great difficulty in saving sentient beings, because they possess the convenient wisdom and skillful means needed to save sentient beings.

The expedient wisdom of cultivating Buddhahood is to accumulate good roots, big and small, to share with all sentient beings, and to dedicate to the supreme Bodhi, so the blessings are immeasurable and endless.

What the Bodhisattvas of the Eighth bhumi need to cultivate in particular is the vow Paramita.

When the Bodhisattva is in the eighth bhumi, the power of vows is inconceivable and miraculous, and all the vows that can be fulfilled will be fulfilled.

For example, if someone wishes to have one's wishes, this wish will surely come true.

95

The Bodhisattva of the Ninth Level specially cultivates the paramita of.

The paramita of ... is a kind of extraordinary wisdom that is vast in its own body and cannot be damaged by other forces.

The Bodhisattvas of the Tenth Level especially cultivates Wisdom Paramita.

Wisdom Paramita is the emptiness of all dharmas in the mind.

After the Buddhas and Tathagatas imparted the great light empowerment to the Bodhisattvas of the Tenth Bhumi, the Bodhisattvas of the Tenth Bhumi will soon be able to master all the dharmas and realize the Great Bodhi.

From the first bhumi to the tenth bhumi, the Bodhisattva and Bodhisattvas who have attained the Way are called after attaining the Way. At this time, the way to cultivate is the Noble Eightfold Path.

##### Section 2 - Noble Eightfold Path

After the Bodhisattva of the first bhumi up to the tenth bhumi of the path of concentration, it is called the post-meditation of the path of meditation.

At this time, we need to cultivate the Noble Eightfold Path. The function of the Noble Eightfold Path is to obtain the Dharma before attaining the order, but to achieve Consummation after attaining the Dharma.

The Noble Eightfold Path is Right View, Right Thought, Right Speech, Right Action, Right Livelihood, Right Effort, Right Mindfulness, and Right Concentration (Samadhi).

**Right View** - The correct view of the Four Noble Truths, etc.

**Right Thought** - also called Right Thinking and Right Intention, is the correct thinking and understanding of the Four Noble Truths and other Buddhist principles.

#### {#pg-96}

**Right Speech** - Don't speak any non-Buddhist language.

The principles taught are the same as those taught by the Buddha, and they are in accordance with the principles and the Dharma.

**Right Action** - Make oneself abide in purity and right behaviour, and eliminate all wrong and unwholesome conduct.

**Right Livelihood** - Live a pure and legitimate life in accordance with the teachings of the Buddha.

**Right Effort** - diligently cultivate the path of Nirvana with one heart and one mind.

Bodhisattvas on the Path of Meditation focus on the pursuit of the Buddha’s land of indwelling nirvana. Bodhisattvas below the Taoist level still have distracting thoughts. For example, the Bodhisattva on the path of resources not only pursues the fruition of Buddhahood, but also pursues the five supernatural powers and a clean body.

**Right Mindfulness** - clearly remembers Buddhist truths such as the Four Noble Truths.

**Right Concentration** - Practise meditation, single-pointed concentration, and observe the principles of the Four Noble Truths in meditation.

The object of the Noble Eightfold Path is to realise the Four Noble Truths.

To practice the Dharma is to cultivate the Noble Eightfold Path according to the wisdom of the post-meditation of the path of meditation..

After attaining the Dao, the main practice is the illusory method. After the practitioner comes out of concentration, the five sense organs will see, hear, and perceive the five realms, such as the art of contemplating illusions.

For example, when observing people without self, you will see that the various "I's" that you originally imagined are like illusions, and in the end there is only the "I" in the famous saying, and then you will understand: the real me is Tathata, although it is an illusion, it can create good and bad karma and receive various results.

Then, the Twelve Links of Dependent Origination related to it are also something that we have to understand and accept.

Section 3 - Merits of the Bodhisattva

The merits of the Bodhisattva on the First Bhumi are incredible, and can be subdivided. Every time a Bodhisattva's rank increases, the merit will increase thousands of times.

The Bodhisattva of the first bhumi can obtain twelve hundred kinds of merits in an instant: transform into a hundred incarnations; each incarnation is surrounded by a hundred bodhisattvas; can see the birth and death of a hundred kalpas; shake a hundred worlds; enter a hundred kinds of samadhi; see a hundred people Buddha; received the blessing of hundreds of Buddhas; manifested in hundreds of Buddha-fields; visited hundreds of pure lands; opened hundreds of Dharma doors; matured and liberated hundreds of sentient beings; lived in the world for hundreds of kalpas.

The twelve merits are compared one by one. The merits of Bodhisattvas in the second bhumi are one thousand, the third is one hundred thousand, the fourth is a hundred kos, the fifth is a thousand kos, the sixth is a hundred thousand kos, and the seventh is a hundred thousand kos. In Nayuta, the number of dust particles in the 103,000 Great Thousand Worlds is the eighth bhumi, the number of dust particles in the million Asamkhaya worlds is the number of the ninth bhumi, and the number of dust particles in the indescribable and unspeakable 3,000 Thousand-Fold Worlds is the tenth bhumi.

We now have a lot of afflictions and karmic obstacles, but now that we understand the five paths, we will rejoice in the merits of Bodhisattva.

For example, in the past, when I thought of a Bodhisattva of the Tenth Bhumi, such as Mahasattva Bodhisattva, my mind would be confused, unable to imagine the merits and virtues of Mahasattva Bodhisattva.

Now you can think of it, what kind of merit does Mahasattva Bodhisattva possess? In an instant, the Bodhisattva can see as many Buddhas as there are grains of sand in the universe; in an instant, he can enter the pure land of so many Buddhas; in an instant, he can teach so many dharmas. It is very important to understand these.

Bodhisattvas on the first bhumi to the tenth bhumi can originally live in the world for hundreds of thousands of kalpas, but some bodhisattvas sometimes want to be reincarnated in the three realms, for example, they want to be reincarnated to save sentient beings.

At this stage, a bodhisattva can take birth as a ruler over Jambudvīpa.

A bodhisattva of the first bhumi can be reincarnated as a ruler over Jambudvīpa, a bodhisattva of the second bhumi can be reincarnated as a ruler over the four continents, a bodhisattva on the third bhumi can be reincarnated a ruler over the Heaven of Thirty-three, like Indra, a bodhisattva in fourth bhumi can be reincarnated as a ruler of the House of Gemini, and a bodhisattva in fifth bhumi can be reincarnated as ruler of Enjoying Emanations. Bodhisattvas of the sixth bhumi can be reincarnated as ruler of Tuṣita, Bodhisattvas of the Seventh bhumi can be reincarnated as a ruler of Controlling Others’ Emanations, Bodhisattvas from the Eighth bhumi can be reincarnated as a ruler over a first-order universe of a thousand realms, Bodhisattvas from the Ninth bhumi can be reincarnated as Brahma, the ruler over a second-order universe of one thousand times one thousand worlds, and Bodhisattvas of the Tenth bhumi can be reborn as the ruler of the gods of a pure realm.

For example, it is commonly said in Tibet that Tibetan King Songtsen Gampo was the incarnation of Guanyin Bodhisattva, King Trisong Detsen was the incarnation of Manjushri Bodhisattva, and Tridé Songtsen was the incarnation of Vajrapani Bodhisattva.

Only when these Bodhisattvas have become Tibetans can they save Tibetans, and this is also a way for Buddhas and Bodhisattvas to save sentient beings.

Some emperors of the Qing Dynasty were also incarnations of Bodhisattvas.

In the past, there was a master in Tibet named Rondo Rinpoche. He wanted to be a good emperor in his next life, since it would be easier to save sentient beings.

When he was about to pass away, he observed with his supernatural powers and saw that several Bodhisattvas were already waiting for the throne.

Bodhisattvas are emperors for the convenience of saving sentient beings, and demons will also fight for the throne, so there were bodhisattvas and demons who were emperors in the past.

Only the sentient beings with stronger willpower and greater merit can become emperors.

Bodhisattvas also have dreams that mortals cannot dream of.

Bodhisattvas from the first bhumi to tenth bhumi will have different levels of dreams. For example, a bodhisattva on the first bhumi will dream that he is sitting on a lion throne to save sentient beings in the six realms; on the second bhumi, a bodhisattva will dream that he goes to innumerable lands, sees innumerable Buddhas, and appears innumerable. Supernatural and so on.

There is no difference in the emptiness of a bodhisattva of the first bhumi to the tenth bhumi of cultivation, but there is a difference between a bodhisattva fof the first bhumi to the tenth bhumi of enlightenment and cultivation.

The vajra metaphor of the final stage of the Bodhisattva in the tenth stage of cultivation can cut off all obstacles, and all the very subtle obstacles of affliction and knowledge will be cut off. Wisdom and the four bodies.

Mahayana's cultivation of the Bodhisattva path is relatively slow, and he needs to accumulate the good fortune of three Asamkhya kalpas in order to become a Buddha.

If you practice tantra on the basis of sutra, you will become a Buddha faster.

At the birth stage of Tantra, the bardo of birth and death can become the three bodies of the Buddha.

Especially when practicing Tantric Buddhism, you need to cultivate the qi meridian in the body. All the qi in the human body is integrated into the central meridian. This way, the central meridian can be opened. After the central meridian is opened, the achievement will be very fast. Buddha.

The four applications of mindfulness, the four correct abandonments, the four spiritual feet, the five powers, the five pure roots, the seven enlightenment factors, and the Noble Eightfold Path are called the The Thirty Seven Practices of the Path of the Bodhisattva.

The Thirty Seven Practices of the Path of the Bodhisattva are the common path of Mahayana and Hinayana. To become a Buddha in Mahayana, one must cultivate The Thirty Seven Practices.

To become an Arhat in Theravada also requires Thirty Seven Practices, but there is a big difference between Theravada and Mahayana.

Shantaguard Bodhisattva

##### Chapter 7 - Learning the Dharma

The Five Paths of Theravada and the Path of the Bodhisattva are called paths of learning.

From the point of view of cutting off afflictions, there is no need to learn and cultivate when the Hinayana does not learn the Dharma, which can be called the path of no-more-learning.

However, at this time, Hinayana practitioners have not yet broken the barriers of knowledge and have not attained Buddhahood. In order to break the barriers of knowledge and attain the status of Buddha, they still need to continue to study and cultivate, so they have the path of learning.

##### Section 1 - Eighteen Dhatus

"Unsightly and Unconscious"

This sentence is about the practice of the eighteen dhatus (elements).

Eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body and mind are the six human sense faculties; color, sound, smell, smell, touch, and dharma are the six external objects; when the six sense faculties meet the six sense objects, the six sense consciousnesses of the eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, mind, and consciousness will arise. The six sense organs, the six sense objects, and the six sense consciousnesses together are called the eighteen dhatus .

The Eighteen Dhatus is a special practice.

When you see beautiful things, be careful not to be greedy; when you see ugly things or people you don’t like, be careful not to get angry; when you see ordinary things, be careful not to be delusional. Ordinary people ignore it, and when they see it, it looks like they haven't seen it, it's called madness.

Likewise, when your ears hear praise from others, don't become greedy; when you hear scolding, don't get angry.

When the nose smells stinky things, there is no anger and hatred, and when it smells fragrant things, there is no greed.

When the tongue tastes something delicious, it is free from greed, and when it tastes something bad, it is free from hatred.

When the body touches something comfortable, it is not greedy, and when it touches something uncomfortable, there is no anger.

The Fa is the object of the mind, don't be greedy when you think of good things, and don't be angry when you think of bad things.

The practice of the Eighteen dhatus is roughly like this.

##### Chapter 2 - Twelve Links of Dependent Origination

---

"No ignorance, no end of ignorance, no end of old age and death, no end of old age and death"

---

This line of the Heart Sutra talks about the Twelve Links of Dependent Origination.

All three vessels will practice Twelve Links of Dependent Origination. Shravakas generally attain awakening according to the Four Noble Truths, but there are also those who practice the Twelve Links of Dependent Origination and attain Arhatship.

Bodhisattvas also practice the Twelve Links of Dependent Origination.

In the three vessels, liberation mainly depends on the Twelve Links of Dependent Origination, which is conditioned enlightenment.

The Twelve Links of Dependent Origination are ignorance, formation, consciousness, name and form, six senses, contact, feeling, craving, grasping, existence, birth, old age and death, which describe a person's past life, present life, and future life.

Ignorance and formations are the afflictions and karma of the previous life; consciousness, name and form, the six sense organs, touch, feeling, craving, clinging, existence, birth, old age and death, these ten are the afflictions, karma and suffering of the present life; 

A summary of the afterlife.

Of the Twelve Links of Dependent Origination, ignorance, craving, and clinging are afflictions; formations and becoming are karma; consciousness, name-and-form, the six senses, contact, feeling, birth, old age and death are suffering.

The Twelve Links of Dependent Origination are all afflictions, karma, and suffering. 

When you understand the Twelve Links of Dependent Origination, you also understand how sentient beings are reborn.

**Ignorance** 

The affliction of ignorance is ego, including innate ego and discriminating ego.

105

**Formations** is karma, and it is the cause of samsara.

In the six realms of rebirth, apart from the cause of liberation, other karma and blessings are all actions.

Consciousness A soul defiled by good and evil karma is called consciousness, and a pure soul is not called consciousness.

**Name-and-Form**

Name-form means that after consciousness entered the womb, it did not form the form before the six entrances.

Entering the womb can be divided into entering the womb through karma and entering the womb through the power of vows. There is a big difference between the two. The defiled soul enters the womb through the power of karma, while the pure soul enters the womb through the power of vows. For example, when a bodhisattva wants to become an ordinary person in order to save sentient beings, he enters the womb through the power of will.

The eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, mind, and mind are formed in the womb, which is called the Six Senses.

After entering the womb, the six senses come into contact with the six objects, which is called touch.

**Feeling** 

After contact, a feeling arises, which is called feeling.

**Craving** has a distinction between pain and pleasure, and the willingness to choose pleasure is love.

**Grasping** and continuing to pursue after choosing pleasant feeling is taking.

Humans can pursue love from the age of two or three.

To create karma in the process of pursuing love is Becoming.

Both existence and action are karma, action is the karma of the previous life, and existence is the karma of the present life.

**Rebirth** in the six realms of reincarnation is life.

After birth, you will grow old and die, that is, **old age and death**.

106

When the Arhats practiced, they were thinking about the Twelve Links of Dependent Origination.

When they see the bones in the tomb, they think: Where did the bones come from? There are bones because someone died; where did that death come from? It is because people grow old and die gradually from birth.

Then continue to think, where does life come from? Why are people born? How did it come about? You will think that it is because of consciousness, that is, the soul of the previous life; after the soul enters the womb, it is  name and form; when the six sense organs in the womb are full, it is the six senses; after the six senses come into contact with the six objects, there is contact; When a touch has perception, it is feeling; the feeling of contact can produce a distinction, like pleasant feeling, hate painful feeling, it is craving; greed for pleasant feeling, and continue to pursue it, it is grasping; in the process of pursuit, it is created again. A lot of karma is existence; when the karma contaminates the soul, it is consciousness; when it dies, the consciousness polluted by the karma enters the womb, which is birth; when the good karma enters the womb, it will enter the good path, and the evil karma enters the womb. Down to the three evil realms.

After birth, one must die, so it is called old age and dying, because it is not necessarily so that one will die when one is old, so it is called death of old age.

The Twelve Links of Dependent Origination can also be thought of in reverse: old age and death come from birth; birth comes from existence; existence comes from grasping; grasping comes from craving; craving comes from feeling; feeling comes from contact; contact comes from six senses; six senses come from name and form; name and form come from consciousness; consciousness comes from formations, action is karma; where does karma come from? From ignorance.

107

After doing this, we will understand: when ignorance and afflictions are cut off, we cut off our formations; when we cut off our foramations, we cut off our consciousness; when we cut off our consciousness, we cut off name and form; when we cut off name and form, we cut off the six senses we cut off contact; cut off the contact, cut off the feeling; cut off the feeling, cut off the craving; cut off the craving, cut off the grasping; cut off the grasping, cut off becoming; cut off becoming, cut off rebirth; cut off the rebirth, cut off Old age and death; when old age and death are cut off, samsara is cut off, and there is liberation.

Therefore, if the initial ignorance defilements are cut off, all the following Twelve Links of Dependent Origination will be cut off.

The affliction of ignorance is the source of all afflictions and karma, the source of all suffering, the source of our samsara.

Section 3 -The Path of Enlightenment


The Hinayana saints are divided into the Solitary Arhats and the Shravakas.

After awakening according to the twelve links, he is liberated, and he is called the Solitary Arhat.

Because Solitary Arhats often practice alone, it is also called solitary enlightenment.

When you are on the path of solitary enlightenment, you can practice the Twelve Links of Dependent Origination. By contemplating the Twelve Links of Dependent Origination, you can attain renunciation. On the basis of renunciation, you have accumulated a hundred kalpas of good fortune, and you can pursue karma with the power of faith that does not turn back. Feel the Arhat fruit bit.

When you practice the path of solitary enlightenment, you will constantly cultivate the Twelve Links of Dependent Origination, and think about what is ego-clinging and what people are without self.

When you reach the solitary enlightenment and realise the nature of emptiness, you will immediately realize that there is no self in human beings.

Continuing to cultivate after seeing the nature of emptiness is cultivating the Dao.

Until the afflictions are cut off by relying on the Twelve Links of Dependent Origination, one will attain the Arhat Status of Dependent Enlightenment.

There is a difference between karmic awareness and shravaka Arhats.

In terms of appearance, because the Arhats have accumulated the merit of a hundred kalpas, they have solemn appearances similar to the Buddha's Sambhogakaya, such as having a bun, white hair, etc., but the sravaka Arhats do not have these.

In terms of realization, the Madhyamika Prasanghika School believes that the Arhats not only cut off the obstacle of afflictions, but also cut off the obstacle of discernment and knowledge.

However, the Madhyamika Prasanghika school believes that the Arhats of the predestined enlightenment have only broken the vexation obstacle, but not the obstacle of distinguishing and knowing.

When practicing, the solitary Arhat likes to practice alone, or in groups of at most four people, usually alone, walking, eating, practicing, and living all by oneself.

Shravakas likes to practice together, and there are at least four senior brothers in the community. This is the difference in their behavior.

Although some Arhats have attained Arhatship, their karma is inconceivable, and there will still be some karma.

For example, Venerable Maudgalyayana.

The Venerable Maudgalyayana often travelled to hell to save sentient beings. Once, he saw a brahmin suffering in hell. The brahmin said to Venerable Maudgalyayana, "Please take a message to my disciples, and tell them to take out the gold and silver that I have hidden at home to make offerings to Sakyamuni Buddha to help me transcend.

Venerable Maudgalyayana went to the house of the brahmin. After he transmitted the brahmin's request, the brahmin's family and disciples were very angry when they heard it: "You came here to insult our teacher and degrade our religion.

They then chased down Venerable Maudgalyayana. Venerable Maudgalyayana was known as the number one supernatural power among the Buddha’s disciples. As long as he manifested supernatural powers, he could run away. Without supernatural powers, he was beaten badly.

In terms of vow power, Shravaka's vow power is to follow the Buddha's practice and follow the Buddha.

The Solitary Arhat is different. The Solitary Arhat often makes a great vow before the path of accumulation: I want to become a Buddha without relying on anyone, and I don’t need a master.

Because of the power of this vow, when the Buddha was alive, the Solitary Arhat would not come back to this world, nor would he come back when the Buddhadharma was there. When the Buddhadharma was gone, the Solitary Arhat would appear.

Before the birth of Buddha Shakyamuni, there were 500 Arhats living in Varanasi, India.

When the Buddha was about to enter the womb, the God of the Heaven of the Thirty-Three told these Arhats that the Buddha was about to be born in the human world.

They said that the light of Buddha is like the sun, we only have the light of fireflies, the world does not need us, let us pass away.

They passed away together. When they passed away, they meditated in the air. The cassock and bowl fell into Varanasi, and their bodies were naturally cremated. The cremated bones also fell into Varanasi.

Buddha Shakyamuni's Dharma can exist for 5,500 years. Now more than 2,500 years have passed. After another 2,000 years, the Dharma will perish.

When the Dharma-ending period arrives, these Solitary Arhats will appear.

Without the Dharma, without a single sutra, how could the Solitary Arhat achieve Arhat fruit? It depends on the willpower, the willpower is incredible.

Because of the power of vows, after seeing the corpse of a dead person, karma will infer and think about the The Twelve Links of Dependent Origination, and can find the root cause of samsara is ignorance.

Then, continuing to rely on the power of vows and the merit of hundreds of kalpas to realize that people have no self, get rid of afflictions and obstacles, they obtain the fruit of Arhatship.

111

Section 4 - The Difficulty of Realizing Emptiness

The Solitary Arhats realize emptiness by virtue of the power of vows and accumulated merit; the Arhats realize emptiness by the wisdom of hearing and contemplation; the Bodhisattva realizes the emptiness by relying on the dual movements of contemplation.

Whether it is to be liberated from samsara or to become a Buddha and save sentient beings, one needs to realize emptiness, but it is very difficult to understand and realize emptiness.

First, it is difficult to explain emptiness.

When Buddhism was flourishing, there were tens of thousands of monks in Nalanda Monastery in India, and there were thousands of learned Panditas. When debating scriptures, ordinary scriptures were debated, and everyone could understand them, but when it came to debating emptiness, When it comes to the relevant teachings, fewer and fewer people could understand it. In the end, there are only a few Panditas left, and emptiness is difficult to understand.

Nagarjuna Bodhisattva wrote the six theories of Nagarjuna to promote the Buddha's Right View of Dependent Origination and emptiness. However, there are many schools whose masters refute the six theories of Nagarjuna. All of them are Great Pandits, and even they do not understand what it is that Nagarjuna said.

Other patriarchs teach less about emptiness.

The emptiness that Venerable Milarepa's master Marpa taught is Mahamudra. Only two or three sheets of paper. Those with deep roots can understand it, but those with shallow roots can't understand it at all.

112

Padmasambhava's writings on emptiness are also just a few sheets of paper, but because no one understands it, the patriarchs don't talk much about it.

Until Master Tsongkhapa, when Master Tsongkhapa made the "Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path to Enlightenment", Manjushri appeared to persuade Master Tsongkhapa: You should talk about emptiness a little more broadly, and let more people understand.

Therefore, Master Tsongkhapa wrote many books on emptiness, including five thick treatises, and the content is also very special.

Master Tsongkhapa taught about emptiness in Tibet for several years, and he was the top one in the whole Tibetan region. He has guided many people to realize emptiness.

Secondly, understanding emptiness is difficult.

In the Heart Sutra, it is said that The Twelve Links of Dependent Origination are empty, are all without self-nature.

There is no ignorance defilement that is ever-present, ignorance defilement is neither eternal nor indestructible, nor can it exist independently, so it can be eliminated and cut off.

Using the wisdom of emptiness to break the ego, according to the view of Madhyamika, Nine logical arguments should be used to understand it.

The Nine Logical Arguments are: 

1. Investigation of the Cause: the Diamond Splinters

2. Investigation of the Result: Refuting Existent or Non-Existent Effects

3. Investigation of Both: Refuting the Four Permutations of Arising

4. Investigation of the Essential Identity: Neither One Nor Many

5. The logical argument of Great Interdependence


Refutation of Production from Four Extremes (Production from Self, Production from Other, Production from Both, Production without Cause), Reasonable Reasonable King Dependent Origination, Refutation of Production from Four Alternatives (Several causes producing a single result, Several causes producing several results, A single cause producing several results, A single cause producing a single result), One Different Reasoning, Diamond Splinters Arument (‘refutation of production of existent and nonexistent effects’
‘refutation of production related to four possible alternatives’
‘dependent arising’ argument
argument of ‘neither one nor many’), Five Reasonable Reasoning, Seven Reasonable Reasoning, Four Essential Reasoning, and Negative Existence Reasoning.

These are all difficult to understand. If you can thoroughly understand these nine logical arguments, it will be easier to understand emptiness.

Among the nine logical arguments, rational reasoning is the most important, because all things and all dharmas are caused by causation, and the combination of causality exists, and causality exists.

Separation does not exist, so all things have no self-nature.

Finally, realizing emptiness is hard.

When Master Tsongkhapa used these nine logical arguments to guide emptiness, Master Sherab Sengge realized emptiness on the spot. In the meditation he entered at that time, there was only emptiness and no worldly truth.

Seeing that everything was gone, and he couldn't even find himself, Master Sherab Sengge was frightened and grabbed the collar of his cassock tightly with both hands.

At this time, Master Tsongkhapa saw it and said, "You have found the mundane truth."

Hearing these words, Master Sherab Sengge eliminated the fear of emptiness, because in the meditation of emptiness one cannot find the mundane truth.

There is a great siddhi in Tibet named Jesser Rinpoche. He practiced in a cave and realized emptiness. He saw that there was nothing left, and he couldn’t even find himself. Searching for myself and shouting, where am I...where am I....

A young shepherd saw this and said, isn't it you who got into the rock? After he heard it, he settled down and was relieved.

In the meditation of emptiness, we can't even find the real self, let alone the self we imagined to be broken.

Master Tsongkhapa used to lecture at Drepung Monastery. When many masters who had realized emptiness went to the main hall, they did not go through the main entrance, but came and went through the wall. This can only be done after realizing emptiness. , is also a meritorious ability.

Section 5 - The Four Noble Truths

"The Way of No Suffering"

Suffering, its origin, its cessation, and the path are called the Four Noble Truths. This sutra says that the path of cessation and cessation of suffering has no self-nature at all.

All three vessels can practice the Four Noble Truths, and the Four Noble Truths are also the main practice of Shravaka.

The Four Noble Truths are in a certain order. It can be divided into two types, the order of practice and the order of cause and effect. Suffering, origination, cessation, and cessation are the order of practice; origination, suffering, cessation, and cessation are the order of cause and effect. Here we talk about the order of cause and effect. If you understand the order of cause and effect, you will naturally understand the order of practice.

The order of cause and effect of the Four Noble Truths is the arising of suffering, the arising and passing away of the path, or the arising of suffering, the arising of suffering, and the arising and passing away of the path. After recognizing suffering, if you feel disgusted with suffering, you will generate renunciation of liberation from the six realms of samsara, which is the path of suffering.

115

To be liberated is the birth and death of the Dharma.

1. Aggregates

Aggregation is the cause of suffering, that is, defilements and karma.

The great defilements have six root defilements and twenty secondary defilements, and there are 84,000 subtler defilements.

Karma can be divided into expiation and sexual sin, expiation refers to the karma of breaking precepts, and sexual sin is the karma of creating ten evil karma.

2. Suffering

The result of clinging is suffering.

When practicing, the first thing is to feel the suffering first, then find the source of suffering, get rid of the source of suffering, and then practice the Dharma to escape the cycle of birth and death.

There are many kinds of suffering.

There are eight sufferings in the human realm: birth, old age, sickness, death, separation from love, resentment and hatred, not being able to seek, and the suffering of grasping the five aggregates.

In the treatise created by the Bodhisattva Asanga, there are one hundred and ten kinds of suffering.

In short, people have thousands of kinds of suffering.

Here we briefly talk about the three sufferings. The three sufferings are suffering of suffering, suffering of change, and All-pervasive suffering. They are the common sufferings of the six realms.

116

Suffering of suffering is suffering within suffering.

Such as the suffering of the three evil realms and the suffering of human diseases.

All six realms have suffering.

In hell, there are sufferings such as cold and heat. In the realm of hungry ghosts, there is the pain of hunger, thirst, and fear. In the realm of animals, there is pain in killing each other. In the realm of human beings, there is the pain of war.

Suffering of change is changes from happiness to suffering. In some scriptures, it is called bad suffering.

For example, going on a trip is a happy thing, but if you walk too much, your feet will hurt, and it will become a pain.

Eating is originally a joy, but eating too much can turn into pain.

These are suffering of change, and all the six realms have the suffering of change.

All-pervasive suffering is difficult for ordinary people to feel, so it is more difficult to understand.

Grasping the five aggregates is to do suffering. If suffering is water, then the five aggregates are water tanks, vessels that carry suffering.

The five aggregates are not only the instruments of suffering in this life, but also the cause of suffering in the future, because the suffering in the future also arises from the five aggregates in this life.

Suffering is not real suffering, it is the suffering that comes from having a body.

With eyes, there will be pain related to the eyes, and with the body, there will be pain.

For example, when our body becomes uncomfortable, we have afflictions and pains.

If this affliction is not cut off, it will be the cause of a certain pain in the next life.

Suffering aggregates will experience suffering and happiness. Happiness can be divided into blissful bliss, peaceful bliss, supreme bliss, great bliss, and wonderful bliss. Empty joy is the only joy, and wonderful joy is eternal joy.

The happiness of us ordinary people is the leakage of happiness, and this impermanent happiness will bring a lot of suffering, so it is also the suffering of action.

The five aggregates of form, feeling, thought, formation, and consciousness all bring suffering, so they are all suffering.

Most of the afflictions in our life are also caused by the five aggregates, and the afflictions or sufferings of previous lives are also caused by the five aggregates. These are all forms of suffering.

Because our five aggregates are leaking bodies, and the causes of leaking bodies are afflictions and karma.

The bodies of Buddhas, Bodhisattvas and Arhats are not like this. For example, the body of Buddha Shakyamuni, although it looks like a physical body, is actually a light body of consciousness and wisdom, just like sunlight.

We all know that no matter what happens in the sun, there is no pain.

Suffering is hard to understand.

Because the afflictions and karma of sentient beings are constantly circulating, suffering and the causes of suffering are constantly circulating and changing, and it is difficult to observe clearly.

The Second Jamyang Zhepa, Konchok Jigme Wangpo, was the abbot of Labrang Monastery for more than 200 years.

Once, the master returned from Xining to Labrang Monastery for seven days, and he kept observing the practice and suffering along the way.

When he arrived at Labrang Monastery, the master said to his eldest disciple that it took seven days to observe and understand the suffering, and it was not complete.

If, after understanding the suffering of karma, the thought of wanting to escape from the cycle of birth and death arises, this state of mind is renunciation, the mind of renunciation of the six realms of samsara.

The mind that is liberated from suffering is not counted as renunciation, because all living beings in the animal realm have that kind of mind, and the mind of liberation from suffering is not counted as renunciation.

Master Yeshe Jianshen said that life is very hard. If you think about the hardships of life, you will find that there is no reason to live.

If there is one thing to say, there is only one: I want to live for the sake of beings in the six realms to become Buddhas.

Without this reason, life is really meaningless.

We ordinary people are not like this, as if there are many reasons to live.

In fact, after carefully thinking about the pain of life, you will understand that there is really no reason to live, the only reason is to be liberated and become a Buddha.

3. The Path

The Dao is the method of liberation, the Dao method.

The path of Accumulation, the path of Joining, the path of Seeing, and the path of Meditation are all mentioned above.

119

It is the method of liberation, and the Thirty-seven factors of enlightenment are the Taoist method.

The main path of Shravaka's liberation is the Four Noble Truths.

When Shravaka practice the Four Noble Truths, they first think about the truth of suffering, find the causes of suffering, then think about how to get rid of them, and then practice the sravakaya path, the Shravaka seeing path, the sravaka practice path, and finally the sravakah practice. Arhatship is attained without cultivation.

4. Cessation

Cessation is liberation, nirvana, and non-cultivation.

In the sixth section, the Shravakas and Arhats, who fully capture the Buddha's language, mainly practice the Four Noble Truths.

If you hear the Mahayana teachings preached by the Buddha, and you don't practice it after hearing it, but pass it on to others as it is, you are called a Voice-Hearer Arhat.

For example, Venerable Ananda listened to the Great Prajna Sutra and other Mahayana schools in front of Buddha Shakyamuni, and then passed it on to others. He did not cultivate himself, but only cultivated the Four Noble Truths. This is called Shravaka.

Among the disciples of Buddha Shakyamuni, most of them were Sravakas, such as Shariputra, Maudgalyayana, Venerable Ananda, Venerable Kasyapa are all Sravakas.

Therefore, at the beginning of the Mahayana classics taught by the Buddha, there is a sentence like "Thus have I heard ...". In all versions of the Heart Sutra, except for the translations of Master Xuanzang and Master Kumarajiva, other versions have this sentence in front of them.

When Buddha Shakyamuni taught the "Heart Sutra", numerous Bodhisattvas and Arhats' relatives memorized it without missing a sentence with their extraordinary wisdom.

Before and after the Buddha passed away, many arhats also passed away with the Buddha. Before the Buddha passed away, the relics and the 80,000 arhats passed away first; after the Buddha passed away, Maudgalyayana and the 70,000 arhats also passed away.

Seeing that the Buddha passed away, these arhats did not want to stay in this world any longer, and they all passed away one after another.

After a few years in this way, the Buddha's eldest disciple, Venerable Kasyapa, said that before the scriptures taught by the Buddha were recorded in writing, even an arhat was not allowed to pass away! He called a meeting of Arhats and recorded all the Dharma that each Arhat heard before the Buddha in Sanskrit.

The Heart Sutra was dictated by Venerable Ananda.

Venerable Ananda said, "Thus have I heard ...", which means that when I listened to the Buddha, it was like this.

This "moment" has three different meanings.

The first meaning means that one can listen to it in an instant, which means that the Heart Sutra taught by the Buddha can be heard and recorded in an instant for a person with a sharp mind like Venerable Ananda.

The second meaning is that I heard the "Heart Sutra" in an instant.

121

One Dharma door, other Dharma door heard in other moments, this shows that Venerable Ananda is a learned Arhat.

The third meaning is that Venerable Ananda has only heard it once, which shows that hearing the teaching is rare.

Section 7 - The Four Ways of Learning in the Three Vehicles

The Dharma taught in the Four Noble Truths refers to the Three Vehicles of Path of Accumulation, the Path of Joining, the Path of Seeing, and the Path of Meditation.

Practitioners have not yet been liberated at the stage of these four paths, and they still need to continue to study. Therefore, these four paths are also called the path of learning .

After passing through these four learning paths, one enters the path of no-more-learning.

Hinayana practitioners are liberated and attain the fruit of Arhatship; the Mahayana practitioners attain the status of Buddha and become Buddhas.

From the perspective of listening, thinking, and cultivating, the four kinds of learning are at different stages of listening to, choosing, comprehending, and cultivating the Dharma.

1. Legal view

The meaning of Faxian View is that from listening to the twelve-point teaching, one obtains the concept of sound and meaning, and then after listening, thinking, and making choices, one obtains a pure and victorious solution.

122

The Path of Accumulation is the view of Dharma.

It is also called Faithful Dao, which means that correct concepts can arise in the five realms of faith, etc.; it is also called shunning and liberation, which means breaking afflictions and obstacles, and realizing the subordination of obedience to the truth of extinction.

After attaining the mind of renunciation, one enters the Path of Accumulation.

The mind liberated from the suffering of actions and the heart that truly pursues the Arhat fruition of predestination are combined together to be the renunciation of the predestination; the heart that is liberated from the suffering of actions and the heart that truly pursues the fruition of the Shravaka is the sum of the hearts of the Shravaka. The renunciation of renunciation; the heart of liberation from suffering and the heart of true pursuit of Buddhahood, the sum of which is the renunciation of Mahayana.

Shravaka's Dharma contemplation is the way of Shravaka's resources.

On the basis of renunciation, starting from the pursuit of liberation, one has obtained the Way of Shravaka.

The Shravaka's Path of Accumulation is also divided into Lesser, Intermediate and Greater Stages.

You can also divide the amount, the current amount, and the decided fund.

Comparing the Shravaka path is the stage of having just realized human being without self, and now the Shravaka path is the stage of obtaining the five supernatural powers, and the finalized path is the realization of a person's Egoless stage.

The present view of the Pratyekabuddha enlightenment method is the Pratyekabuddha enlightenment resource, and the Pratyekabuddha Path of Accumulation is also divided into Lesser, Intermediate and Greater Stages.

Pratyekabuddhas must accumulate a hundred kalpas of good fortune in the karmic path, so it takes a long time to complete the karma path.

Shravakas do not need to accumulate this kind of good fortune, so the time for Shravaka's sustenance is relatively short.

123

The Mahayana view is the Bodhisattva's Path of Accumulation.

The first path to pursue Buddhahood is the Mahayana Path of Accumulation. The Mahayana conception requires not only renunciation, but also Bodhicitta.

From the moment of attaining bodhicitta, one has entered the path of Mahayana sustenance.

The Mahayana Path of Accumulation is also divided into Lesser, Intermediate and Greater Stages, because it takes a long time to accumulate merit for countless kalpas.

The Mahayana Path of Accumulation has Bodhicitta, Dharma joy, the five eyes, and a great power of vows. The Hinayana Path of Accumulation does not have these.

Second, the concept of righteousness
The meaning of Yi Xian Guan is that, after practicing Dharma appearance again and again, Bian Quant realizes the realization of non-self.

Path of Joining is the concept of righteousness.

It is also called the decision-making point, and it is also called the wisdom of Path of Seeing without leakage, which means that it is only one part of the wisdom of perfection without leakage.

Path of Joining is further divided into Nuanjiaxingdao, Dingjiaxingdao, Renjiaxingdao, and the world's first Fajiaxingdao.

Before the practice of the Path of Joining, meditation and wisdom could not be practiced together. Since the double practice of concentration and wisdom, it has entered the way of Path of Joining from the Path of Accumulation.

Shravakaya's conception of righteousness is the practice of sravakaya.

In addition to warm, top, forbearance, and the world's first method, it can also be divided into Lesser, Intermediate and Greater Stages.

The main practice of the Shravaka Path is the emptiness of human beings without self. After cultivating the emptiness of human beings on the Shravaka Path of Accumulation, after attaining the peace of mind and body, they enter the Shravaka Path.

The predestined view of the righteousness is the predestination and the practice of the Dharma.

It is also divided into four levels: warmth, summit, acceptance, and the supreme attribute.

However, the time for the first Dharma and practice of the predestined enlightenment was very short, and it passed in an instant, and then I entered the predestined enlightenment.

The Mahayana conception of the present is the way of the Bodhisattva.

It is also divided into four stages: warmth, summit, acceptance, and the supreme attribute, and each stage is divided into three levels, because the Mahayana practice takes a long time, and it will accumulate the blessings of countless kalpas.

The Theravada path is somewhat different. Among them, the first Dharma addition path in the world is over in an instant, so it cannot be divided into three levels.

3. The View of Truth

Dharma meditation means the realization of the true nature of the Dharma.

The Path of Seeing is to see the truth.

It is further divided into three types: seeing the Dao, breaking the Dao, seeing the Dao, liberating the Dao, and seeing the Dao and attaining the Dao.

After seeing the Dharma, and attaining the Dharma, one can observe the Four Noble Truths and the sixteen signs, namely:

125

The four elements of the truth of suffering: impermanence, suffering, emptiness, and no-self.

The four elements of the truth of collection are: cause, collection, birth, and condition.

The four elements of the truth of extinction are: extinction, tranquility, wonderfulness, and separation.

The Four Elements of the Truth of Dao: Dao, Brightness, Action, and Exit.

Shravaka can be divided into voice-hearers breaking off and Path of Seeing, voice-hearers liberation

After seeing the Dao and the voice-hearing and seeing the Dao, it can also be divided into the eight forbearances and the eight wisdoms.

From the beginning of Path of Seeing, the Shravaka has realized the emptiness of human beings without self, and can break the afflictions of discrimination. Among them, there are forty kinds of afflictions of discrimination in the desire realm, and thirty-six kinds each in the form realm and the formless realm. One hundred and twelve aspects in total.

Predestined awareness and seeing the Dharma can break the vexation barrier of discrimination.

When Mahayana Bodhisattva sees the way, he can break the obstacle of discriminating afflictions and discriminating knowledge.

Fourth, after the present

The meaning of hindsight is to continue to practice the Noble Eightfold Path after seeing the position of the Way, until the true meaning is realized.

Cultivation of the Dao is the concept of hindsight, which is divided into three levels: cultivating the Dao to break the Dao, cultivating the Dao to liberate the Dao, and attaining the Dao after cultivating the Dao.

After the voice-hearer, the contemplation is the practice of the voice-hearer, which can break the sixteen kinds of innate afflictions.

According to the difference in strength, thickness, etc., these sixteen kinds of innate affliction obstacles are further divided into nine or eighty-one grades.

The classification method of the nine grades is: big afflictions are divided into three grades, large and medium, large and medium, and large and small; medium afflictions are divided into three grades, medium-large, medium-medium, and medium-small; small There are three kinds of afflictions, the big in the small, the medium in the small, and the small in the small.

The classification method of the eighty-one grades is: there are nine grades of afflictions born in the desire realm, thirty-six grades each in the form realm and the formless realm, for a total of eighty-one grades.

At the same time, there are also eighty-one levels of meditation in the three realms and nine places: the desire world, the nine places, the form world, and the four meditation dhyanas, which are divided into the first, second, third, and fourth dhyanas. The four colorless lands of the realm are divided into the emptiness and boundless place, the boundless place of consciousness, the place of nothingness, and the top heaven and earth, a total of thirty-six elements.

There are eighty-one innate afflictions in total, eighty-one in the meditation of the Shravaka, and eighty-one in the path of cultivating and liberating.

Each level of meditation of breaking the path corresponds to cutting off the afflictions of the first level, and then entering the corresponding path of cultivation and liberation at the same stage, the same continuous flow, and so on, until the eighty-first level.

The first eighty stages belong to the path of cultivation. In the last stage, practitioners, according to the final vajra metaphor, cut off the afflictions of the small, medium, and small in the formless realm, and attain the fruit of Arhatship.

Therefore, the eighty-first rank of Shravaka's path of cultivating and liberating belongs to the path of no-learning Shravaka.

Predestination after enlightenment is the practice of enlightenment.

There are also three kinds of cultivating the way of predestined enlightenment, the way of renunciation of predestination and enlightenment, the way of liberation from cultivation of predestination and enlightenment, and the way of attaining Dao after cultivating the way of predestination.

Cultivating the path of predestination can break the obstacles of innate afflictions.

The Madhyamika Prasanghika School believes that the cultivation of predestined enlightenment not only breaks the obstacles of innate afflictions, but also breaks the obstacles of gross knowledge.

After the Mahayana, the view is that the Bodhisattva cultivates the way.

There are three types of Bodhisattva cultivation ways: Bodhisattva cultivating the way of breaking the way, Bodhisattva cultivating the way of liberation, and Bodhisattva cultivating the way and attaining the way.

When a Bodhisattva cultivates the Way, he can break the obstacles of innate afflictions and obstacles of innate knowledge.

Section 8 - The difference between big and small multiplication

In order to save sentient beings, the Buddha turned the wheel of Dharma three times and taught different Dharma doors for sentient beings with different abilities.

Living beings have different motivations for liberation, different abilities, and different views. Therefore, Buddhism is divided into Mahayana and Hinayana.

The Hinayana mainly focuses on the content of the Buddha's first turning of the Four Noble Dharma Wheel, and the Mahayana practice is the content of the third turning of the Law Wheel, among which the main practice is the content of the second turning of the Dharma Wheel.

There are many differences between Mahayana and Hinayana, which are briefly mentioned here.

128

One, the heart is different
First of all, there must be renunciation in magnitude and multiplication.

To renounce the mind is to renounce the mind of the six realms of samsara.

Without renunciation, the Hinayana will not be liberated, and the Mahayana will not become a Buddha without renunciation. Only on the basis of renunciation, can one cultivate the corresponding Dharma door in order to obtain their respective result.

In addition to renunciation, the Mahayana has great compassion, great compassion, and bodhicitta, but the Hinayana arhats do not, and the Hinayana does not increase the sense of responsibility.

There are two kinds of great compassion and great compassion, one is the great compassion and great compassion like a mother, and the other is the great compassion and great compassion like a father.

For a child, there is a difference between the great compassion of the mother and the father. The mother's great compassion may just love him, while the father's great compassion is not only love, but also takes great responsibility.

If a child of parents who love them falls into a river, the mother will usually just cry and scream by the river, begging for help, and the father will jump in without hesitation to save the child.

Only the Mahayana practitioners have the great compassion of fathers, but the Hinayana does not have the great compassion and great compassion like their mothers.

To increase the sense of responsibility is to bravely take responsibility for saving sentient beings in the six realms, and neither ordinary people nor Theravada Arhats have such a mind.

129

2. The vows are different

In order to become a Buddha and save sentient beings, Mahayana Bodhisattvas will make great vows and have great vowing power.

For example, the Bodhisattva of the first bhumi can make one hundred thousand great vows for the sake of sentient beings in the six realms, and the Bodhisattva of the second bhumi can make a million great vows.

The Theravada Arhats do not have so many vows, nor do they have such great power.

3. Different Results

There is a difference between the size and the vehicle in the fruit position pursued by practice.

The Mahayana pursues the fruit of Buddhahood, and the Hinayana pursues the fruit of an Arhat.

The Mahayana Buddhahood is far higher than Theravada Arhats in terms of wisdom and ability.

The purpose of Mahayana practice is to benefit oneself and others. In addition to liberating oneself, we also need to save sentient beings in the six realms.

The Theravada Arhats also teach sutras and teachings and save sentient beings, but compared to the scope of the Mahayana teachings, they are very small.

In other respects, the Mahayana is the dual cultivation of blessings and wisdom, that is, the dual cultivation of blessings and convenient methods.

The Hinayana is mainly about cultivating wisdom, realizing emptiness, realizing that people have no self, and then liberation.

The difference in size multiplication is probably like this.

130

##### Chapter 8 - Path of No-more-learning


first quarter off
The cessation of the Four Noble Truths is liberation, Nirvana, and non-cultivation.

The Path of No-more-learning means that the obstacles have been broken, and there is no need to practice any more.

Path of No-more-learning, there are shravakas, predestined enlightenment, and Mahayana Paths of No-more-learning.

There are two types of sravakas who have not cultivated the way, those who have been cut off and gradually cut off the Arhats, and those who have been cut off and cut off the Arhats.

It does not necessarily take a long time to cultivate shravaka arhatship. There are some who become arhats in three or four years, and there are many who become arhats in one lifetime.

Yuanjue Wu cultivated the path and cut off the obstacles of afflictions, and obtained a majestic appearance similar to that of the Bodhisattva of the Eighth Bhumi.

The Mahayana Path of No-more-learning broke the two obstacles, obtained the four bodies of the Buddha, and obtained the perfect blessing and ability.

Section 2 - Arhat Fruit

"No Wisdom and No Gain"

"Wisdom" is wisdom, the wisdom of the three vehicles of sravaka, karma, and bodhisattva is wisdom, and "no wisdom" means that wisdom also has no self-nature.

"Acquisition", the fruit status obtained through practice is called "Tai", and "non-achievement" means that the ultimate enlightenment Arhatship, Shravaka Arhatship, and Buddha's fruition are also without self-nature.

This is followed by the sentence "The Path of Accomplishment and Destruction of No Suffering", which mainly refers to the wisdom and realization of the Hinayana Arhats.

After attaining Arhatship, 84,000 afflictions are cut off, and 84,000 kinds of happiness are obtained. At this time, the happiness of all ordinary people combined is not as great as that of an Arhat.

Bodhisattvas also have this kind of happiness, but in order to save sentient beings, Bodhisattvas will give up this kind of happiness and continue to practice until they become Buddhas.

An Arhat accepts this happiness and likes to abide in peace all the time.

It is very difficult to get out of this kind of blissful concentration. It takes all the Tathagatas to snap their fingers together to get them out of samādhi. After they come out of samādhi, they also need to encourage them to enter the Mahayana. Stay in the middle for a long time, maybe hundreds of kalpas, or even tens of thousands of kalpas, and then come out.

It takes a long time to do this over and over again, so it is very difficult for an Arhat to become a Buddha.

When an Arhat did not enter the time period, some people asked him, because of his supernatural powers, he could immediately know and protect all sentient beings.

After entering meditation, it is different. Arhats in meditation cannot see the suffering of the six realms, nor can they see the worldly affairs.

After the Buddha Shakyamuni passed away, the King of Resentment was very sad. Venerable Kasyapa went to the palace to see him, and the King of Resentment came to greet the Venerable on an elephant. When he saw Venerable, he was very excited and wanted to jump from the elephant. When he climbed down and bowed, Venerable Kasyapa immediately used his supernatural powers to catch him. Venerable said to him, you will not allow this in the future, it is too dangerous, but fortunately I did not enter samadhi.

Arhats are different from Buddhas and Bodhisattvas. Buddhas are always in meditation, and they can show their supernatural powers freely at all times.

When the Bodhisattva enters the emptiness, although he cannot see the worldly truth, the power of the Bodhisattva's vows will make all sentient beings wish.

When an Arhat is in meditation, he can't show his supernatural powers, can't help sentient beings, and can't save people.

The Five Paths of Theravada are finished here.

##### Section 3 - Mahayana Path of No-more-learning

"Because of nothing"

This sentence speaks of the Mahayana Path of No-more-learning.

When Mahayana did not practice the Dao, he already attained great Bodhi and became a Buddha.

"Nothing at all" means that the Buddhahood attained by Mahayana practitioners also has no self-nature. The Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha all have no self-nature.

After becoming a Buddha, you will gain the inconceivable merits of Buddha's body, speech, and mind.

1. The merits of the Buddha's body

The Dharma appearance of the Buddha is simply the body of the Buddha.

The appearance of the Buddha is very solemn. When the Buddha is teaching the sutras, some people look at him without blinking. After he has finished teaching the sutras, they are still looking at it. After a hundred years of reading, it is not enough.

The Buddha has thirty-two excellent marks and eighty sublime appearances.

"Xiang" means that the owner is a man, and "good" is a symbol of inner merit.

If you can often think about the Buddha's good qualities and the causes of the Buddha's good qualities, the practice will be more blessed.

Nagarjuna Bodhisattva said when he talked about the Buddha's good qualities in the "The Madhyamika Theory": 

If you add up the merits of the solitary Arhats, the Shravakas, and the infinite merits of the world, and then multiply by ten times, Only one "pore appearance" of the Buddha's body can be achieved; one hundred times of all the blessings of the pores can achieve a "good"; only one hundred times of all the eighty kinds of good blessings can one achieve a "good" Only by achieving a thousand times the merits of all the thirty-two features can one achieve the "white hair" of the Buddha; only by achieving one hundred thousand times the merit of the white hair, can one achieve the "topknot" of the Buddha; One thousand times the virtue of one thousand times, in order to achieve the blessing of "Buddha language and Sanskrit sound".

In addition, the various parts of the Buddha's appearance and goodness have the function of teaching the Dharma.

The topknot and pores have the function of mind, which can clearly see deep and wide all dharmas.

Therefore, the body of the Buddha pervades all knowledge, and the words of the Buddha and the mind of the Buddha pervade at the same time.

Therefore, it is said that all worlds are reflected in the Buddha's body, and the Buddha's body pervades all the worlds.

The secret of the Buddha's body is inconceivable.

For example, the Buddha's topknot appears to be only four fingers high when looking up, but the real height is immeasurable.

In the "Inconceivable Sutra on the Secrets of the Tathagata", it is said that Bodhisattva Holding Li used his supernatural powers to fly up through the boundless worlds, but he was never able to see the top of the Buddha's bun, and finally returned tiredly.

The Buddha's body is a rainbow body with a bright, clean and bright body. The light shines. The "Vinaya Sutra" uses three metaphors to praise the Buddha's body:

Add fire to the body; 

like butter filled with flame; 

like a lamp in a golden vessel.

Every kind of light emitted by the Buddha's body can ripen and liberate countless sentient beings; in front of every living being, the Buddha can transform into a body that he can accept, and speak in a language he can understand.

In addition, when people see the Buddha body, they will have the idea of ​​wanting to obtain the Buddha body, and they will pursue and accumulate the merits of becoming the Buddha body, which is also a kind of aspiration to obtain the body of a Buddha.

The Buddha's clothes are always separated from the body by four fingers, but people who come to honour the Buddha can clearly see the outline of the Buddha's body; the Buddha's feet do not touch the ground, but can clearly leave a wheel pattern in the fottprints on the ground.

If the ants and other sentient beings happened to be crushed by the Buddha's feet while the Buddha was walking, they would be immersed in great happiness for seven days and then reborn in the heavenly realm.

2.  Merits of Buddha's Speech 


The Buddha has sixty-four speech qualities.

Master Tsongkhapa said on the basis of the Treasure Accumulation Sutra: The Essence of Truth:

All sentient beings in all the world, at one time inquire into all doubts, do everything in front of each, their body and speech are solemn and present at the same time, although they are engaged in work and rest separately.

When Buddha Shakyamuni preached the sutras, if you listened to it from the front rows, the sound would not be loud; if you listened to it from far away, the sound would not be small, and it sounded the same.

When sentient beings hear it, they will feel that every word is directed at their own afflictions, and every word is useful.

Especially when people of different races listen to the scriptures together, what they hear from the Buddha is the language they are familiar with, what the Chinese hear is Chinese, and what the Tibetans hear is Tibetan.

Buddhas can answer different questions asked by people of different roots at the same time, and what everyone hears is the answer to their own question.

Buddha Shakyamuni has such inconceivable qualities of speech.

3. The Buddha's Intention and Merit
Buddha has great compassion, great wisdom, and perfect ability.

(1) The compassion and virtue of Buddha
Great compassion and great compassion refers to the compassion and virtue of the Buddha.

The Buddha sees that all living beings in the six realms are equal, and loves every living being, and the Buddha's compassion is different from ours.

"One Hundred and Fifty Praises" says:

All sentient beings, there is no difference between delusion and bondage, to solve the delusion of sentient beings, respect for a long time as the bondage of sorrow.

We ordinary people generally have compassion when we see suffering beings, sometimes with compassion, sometimes without; sometimes our compassion grows and sometimes it decreases.

And because the Buddha has always seen that all living beings are suffering, his great compassion never stops, and he constantly saves all living beings.

(2) The wisdom and merit of the Buddha
Great wisdom is the wisdom and merit of the Buddha.

The truth of all dharmas, all the principles of dependent arising, all realms, Buddhas can understand.

The wisdom of the Buddha can arise anytime, anywhere, without hindrance.

In "Zan Ying Zan" says:

The World-Honored Dharma of the Fallen Time, all species are born from the root, like the sour fruit in the palm of the hand, it is the state of mind and action.

All dharmas are moving and not moving, if they are one or more, they are like the wind in the sky, and there is nothing to hinder the respect.

In the first four sentences, the Buddha sees the causes of dependent origination of all dharmas very clearly, just like looking at the ummara fruit in his hand (a kind of almost transparent fruit produced in India at that time), which is the realm of Buddha's intention.

The last four sentences are to say that all dharmas, whether in the world of sentient beings or in the world of objects, when the Buddha's mind observes these things, is like the wind in the sky, without hindrance, fully understood, without the slightest doubt.

This is the merit of the Buddha's will to distinguish, that is, the merit of the Buddha's wisdom.

(3) Buddha's ability to complete the merits
The merits of the Buddha's mind also include the perfection of the Buddha's ability.

The ability of the Buddha is indescribable and inexhaustible.

For example, the Buddha is everywhere, blessing sentient beings all the time, as long as our pure faith is opened, we can immediately obtain the blessing of the Buddha.

The merits of the Buddha's mind are the most wonderful.

Everyone should know that from the day of taking refuge, Buddhas and Bodhisattvas are by our side, following us like shadows and protecting us.

Whatever pain or trouble we have, the Buddha knows that the Buddha has this kind of wisdom, which is the merit of the Buddha's mind.

Not only does the Buddha have this kind of wisdom, but he also has a great compassion that never diminishes.

Other gods, or Arhats, have limited ability of mind, merit or supernatural powers, and cannot understand all the sufferings of living beings.

For example, after an arhat enters samadhi, he will not know the suffering of all sentient beings; nor will ordinary worldly gods know the suffering of everyone.

If we are in trouble and ask these gods for help, even if he knows how, he may not be able to save us.

Even if we have power, we may not be able to save us.

Because ordinary gods do not have great compassion and compassion, only the Buddha who has great compassion, has the ability, and will definitely save us! It is because the Buddha has the most perfect and supreme mind and merit.

**Chapter 9 - San Shi Dao**

The five ways can all be summed up in the three ways, and the five ways of Theravada belong to the zhongshi way in the three ways.

The Mahayana Five Paths belong to the Shangshi Path.

Sanshi Dao is divided into common and non-common ways.

The way of the sergeant and the way of the sergeant are common to the Dao and the Dao, because both the Dao and the Dao of the zhongshi need to be cultivated.

The sage path is not a common path, because the sage path is only the path for Mahayana practitioners to practice.

Zhongshi Dao mainly cultivates renunciation and morality, concentration and wisdom.

Both renunciation and morality, concentration, and wisdom are both practiced, and they are the common Dharma door.

The Taoist monks practice the impermanence of life, the heart of taking refuge, and cause and effect, and they are also the common method of the Mahayana and the Great Vehicle.

The common path of mortals is to cultivate the path of mortals for the sake of liberation and becoming a Buddha, and it is not a common path of mortals just to cultivate the path of mortals.

The common zhongshidao is to cultivate the zhongshidao in order to become a Buddha, just to obtain the Arhatship is not a common zhongshidao, and the upper shidao is an uncommon path.

140

Chapter 10 The Bodhisattva
The first section of the Bodhisattva
"Bodhisattva"

As mentioned earlier, "Bodhi" means to realize and break.

The realization is the realization of emptiness, and the most complete realization is the realization of the wisdom of the Buddha, and the realization of all knowledge.

Cut off, temporarily cut off afflictions, the most thorough cut is to cut off afflictions and knowledge obstacles, and obtain the Buddha's nirvana without abiding.

"Sat" means brave.

In addition to the pursuit of Buddha's wisdom and Nirvana, there is also the courage to save sentient beings in the six realms. The combination of these three is Bodhicitta, and one is indispensable.

How to generate bodhicitta?

It is necessary to cultivate the seven branches of karma to generate bodhicitta and to exchange bodhichitta from others.

142

Yuanjue has this kind of brave mentality, but lacks the bodhicitta of saving sentient beings, so he did not become a Buddha, but became Yuanjue Arhat.

Section 2 Ten Paramitas
"Because of Prajnaparamita"

Bodhisattva attains Buddhahood through prajna wisdom, which is prajna Paramita.

The most accurate Sanskrit pronunciation of "Paramita" is "Bharamada", which is translated as "to the other shore", and is also translated as "degree", which is divided into six degrees or ten degrees.

Six paramitas are called six degrees, ten paramitas are called ten degrees, and what we want to talk about here is ten paramitas.

When a bodhisattva cultivates paramitas, from one place to ten places of bodhisattva, he must also achieve different bodhisattva status according to different paramitas.

1. Giving Paramita
There are three kinds of giving paramitas: wealth giving, dharma giving, and fearless giving.

143

(1) Wealth giving
The greatest offering is to make offerings to the guru's Three Jewels.

Building a Buddha statue is also a relatively large offering, and it belongs to the Dharma Paramita.

For us ordinary people, there are seven ways to accumulate blessings day and night.

The first way is to be ordained.

If you take the five precepts from today, you will accumulate blessings day and night until you break the precepts.

If you don't break the precepts, you will accumulate blessings day and night until old age and death.

The second method is to build Buddha statues.

For those who are determined to build a Buddha statue, they start accumulating blessings from the moment they have this idea. After the construction is completed, the Buddha statue can exist for as long as it is, and the blessings will continue to accumulate day and night.

The third method is to make offerings to the monks.

Long-term support for the monks, this is also a day and night accumulation of good fortune.

The fourth is to help those who are seriously ill.

Help him do things, wait on him; or help him heal, without receiving money or giving him money, this is a way to accumulate good fortune day and night.

There are seven methods like this. Others, such as giving money to the poor, donating money, and doing charity work, all belong to the charitable giving.

(2) Fabusch
When teachers teach the scriptures and spread the Dharma, it is Dharma giving.

Ordinary people don't have the ability to teach the Fa, so how can we practice almsgiving?

You can visualize yourself as Shakyamuni Buddha, with a white light emitting from your heart, welcoming sentient beings from the six realms, kneeling in front of you, and then reciting the Heart Sutra aloud to give to all sentient beings.

After reciting, visualize the strong light coming out of your heart, illuminating the living beings in the six realms, and saving them. This is also a kind of Dharma giving.

(3) Fearless Giving
All living beings have all kinds of terror. To save all beings from terror is to give without fear. The result of giving without fear is health and longevity.

For example, releasing life saves the lives of sentient beings, releasing life is fearless giving, and it is the most extraordinary fearless giving, because releasing living has three kinds of giving at the same time: wealth giving, dharma giving, and fearless giving.

If you are a doctor, if you don’t have the idea of ​​making money, you can do fearless giving every day, because you are saving people every day, and all you do is fearless giving.

Giving medicine is fearless giving, not for making money, but also giving wealth and giving without fear. Using one's own money to buy a lot of medicines to send to patients is even more of giving wealth.

In other respects, being able to stand up when sentient beings need help is fearless giving.

For example, sending timid people home, seeing others being bullied and discouraging them, etc.

2. Precept Paramita
Precepts are the basis for all merits to arise.

The essence of precepts is to renounce evil.

If you don't have the awareness of renunciation of evil, even if you don't do evil things, it is not considered to be keeping the precepts.

There are three kinds of paramitas for keeping the precepts: the precepts of rhythmic rituals, the precepts of good dharmas, and the precepts of benefiting sentient beings.

(1) Precepts
To be able to subdue the body, speech, and mind so that they do not create bad karma is to take the discipline and precepts.

The body does not kill, does not steal, does not commit sexual misconduct; the mouth does not lie, does not speak slanderous words, does not speak evil, and does not speak slander;

The contents of the precepts of not liberation belong to the precepts of the precepts.

Taking precepts can liberate the bad karma of body, speech, and mind respectively, so it is called the precepts for liberation. There are eight kinds: Upasaka precepts, Upasaka precepts, novice precepts, novice precepts, learning precepts, nun precepts, and monk precepts , Bhikuni precepts, and the eight-pass fasting of Theravada also belongs to the other precepts.

The precept of not liberation mainly subdues the body and the mouth.

Most of the precepts of monks are the precepts of body and speech, and the precepts of mind are very few.

For example, do not steal, use your body to steal, do not kill, do not commit sexual misconduct, all are body precepts.

In addition to refraining from lying, these four fundamental precepts are the precepts of body and speech, and not drinking alcohol is also the precept of body.

Most of the bodhisattva vows and tantric vows are for subduing the mind, which is the mind.

Because our heart is like a basketball, all kinds of thoughts keep jumping around and cannot be fixed, so it is difficult to clean.

After taking the precepts, you will accumulate blessings day and night.

The precepts for renunciation and the five precepts at home are the precepts for sentient beings. If they can be purified, they will accumulate blessings every day.

The Bodhisattva Precepts and the Tantric Precepts are the precepts of life after life. If they can be purified, every day of life and life will accumulate blessings and increase merit.

(2) The Dharma Precepts of Receiving Goodness
The vow to practice all the good dharmas is called the precepts of the good dharma.

Only Bodhisattvas have this kind of Dharma precepts, and we ordinary people should also learn from Bodhisattvas, which has great merit.

For example, helping to do volunteer work, helping to make offerings, helping to release animals, etc.

(3) Precepts for benefiting sentient beings
To benefit all sentient beings widely is to benefit sentient beings.

I will do everything that is beneficial to all beings. For example, if someone is tired, provide them with a place to rest; if someone is hungry, provide them with food; if someone is in pain, give them some comfort; and many more.

3. Endure the humiliation of Paramita
There are three types of humiliation paramitas: patience with resentment, patience with suffering, and patience with discernment.

(1) Tolerate resentment
If you are hurt, beaten, or wronged by others, you must endure it.

Why endure it? Because these are the results of the karma that you created in the past or present life, if you are willing to accept it,

Eliminating karma.

Before liberation, at Xiaqiong Monastery in Qinghai, there was a lama who couldn't get along with a Geshe, and the lama always wanted to harm this Geshe.

Once, something was stolen from Xia Qiong Monastery, the lama wrote an article and posted it on the gate, saying that the Geshe stole it, but the Geshe said nothing.

Everyone thinks that when someone posts an article saying that he stole something, and he doesn't defend it, that's what he stole.

Two years later, a villager sent back the stolen items. Because he stole the items from the temple, he often had nightmares after returning home, and now he regretted sending it back.

Only then did everyone know that this Geshe was practicing forbearance.

Being framed and wronged by others, if you can endure it, you can eliminate a lot of karma.

It can even eliminate the karma of stealing from life to generation. Those who truly understand the Buddhist scriptures will happily endure it, thinking that this is a good opportunity to eliminate karma.

(2) Endure suffering
When cultivating the Dharma or benefiting sentient beings, to endure all suffering is called An Suffering Suffering.

For example, when chanting sutras, or during group cultivation, sitting on the ground all the time, enduring leg pain, foot pain, and back pain is all about suffering and suffering.

(3) Inspect Dharma and Forbearance
The truth is the ultimate truth. What does it mean to observe the Dharma-forbearance? In the process of cultivating the Buddhadharma, how difficult it is to observe the Two Noble Truths and cultivate emptiness; how difficult it is to read books and listen to sutras, if you don’t give up at this time, but persevere, this is called Dharma-Forbearance.

For example, when Master lectures on the sutras sometimes for a long time, when you sit and listen, your body will feel numb and painful, and you have to endure it.

If you get sick while listening to the scriptures, you must realize that you are eliminating karma.

Once when I was teaching the scriptures, I caught a cold on the day I started teaching the scriptures. I was about to finish teaching the scriptures, and the cold was fine. This was eliminating karma, and I had to endure it no matter how painful it was.

4. Diligent Paramita
Diligence eliminates laziness and at the same time prevents evil.

There are three types of diligence paramitas: Armored diligence, good-hearted diligence, and benefiting sentient beings diligence.

When wearing armor and diligently, when doing good deeds, good deeds, or learning the Buddhadharma, like a soldier wearing armor on the battlefield, we are not afraid of difficulties and dangers, go forward bravely, and break all obstacles. This kind of diligence is called wearing armor and diligence.

Acquiring good effort, cultivating diligently on the six paramitas, is called accommodating diligence.

Ordinary people needless to say, neither Shravaka nor Fate-jue Arhats have such diligence.

It is a precept to benefit all beings and to benefit all beings, and the diligence in benefiting all beings is to benefit all beings.

When cultivating diligent paramita, you must start from the contemplation of impermanence. If you understand the principle of impermanence, and the concept of impermanence arises in your heart, you will naturally be diligent.

5. Meditation Paramita
Simply put, it is called meditation when the body and mind are settled.

After attaining meditation, you will gain many miraculous abilities and merits.

Meditation can be divided into light and stable body and mind, merit presentation, and benefiting all beings.

(1) Peace of mind
Peace of mind in body and mind is a virtue after attaining meditation.

If you have cultivated the tranquility of the body, the body will be very light, very light, and very comfortable.

One of my masters, Master Gazang Qusong, achieved meditation when he was young. His body was very light and light. When he was in his nineties, he stood up without using his hands to support the ground, and got up all at once.

The sunshine in Qinghai is relatively strong. When he walked down the street with his head wrapped around his head, everyone behind him thought he was a little lama.

(2) Merit presents meditation
Merit presentation concentration is the concentration of merits such as cultivating supernatural powers on the basis of meditation.

After getting meditation, you can cultivate the five supernatural powers in an instant.

Once, a donor made offerings to Shakyamuni Buddha. The donor's home was more than 60 kilometers away from where Shakyamuni lived. How to get there? Go with supernatural powers.

Buddha Shakyamuni told Venerable Ananda that the disciples who have supernatural powers go, and those who do not have supernatural powers stay.

How to investigate whether there is supernatural power or not? Using a kind of branch, called Jiezhi, is a kind of utensil for monks.

Venerable Ananda took some precept sticks and walked up to the monks. The monk who took the precept sticks explained that he had supernatural powers and could go with the Buddha; those who did not take precept sticks did not go.

When the branch was separated, there was a monk who had meditation but no supernatural powers. He wanted to go, and immediately cultivated supernatural powers. He obtained supernatural powers in an instant. Then he also took the precept branch and flew to the donor’s house with the supernatural powers of Shakyamuni Buddha.

(3) Benefit sentient beings
Using the power of meditation to benefit sentient beings, to bless others, and to help others do things is to benefit sentient beings.

6. Wisdom Paramita
The essence of wisdom is the ability to discern the object of observation and the ability to distinguish between good and evil, that is, the ability to distinguish between black and white, good and evil, etc.

Wisdom Paramita can be divided into: ultimate wisdom, mundane wisdom, and wisdom of benefiting all beings.

(1) The ultimate wisdom
The wisdom of the ultimate truth talks about emptiness, which is the emptiness of dependent origination, the reality and nature of all things.

Regarding the emptiness of dependent origination, different schools have different views. The Gelug School holds the middle view, which is based on the six theories of Nagarjuna Bodhisattva.

Buddha Shakyamuni once turned the wheel of Dharma three times, and Nagarjuna's six discourses are derived from the second turn of the Dharma wheel without signs.

The Gelug School's right view of Madhyamika has integrated the right views of other schools. Therefore, the Gelug School's ultimate wisdom and right view is the most sublime, the most ultimate, and the most complete.

(2) Wisdom of mundane truth
The wisdom of the mundane truth speaks of the wisdom of the Five Brightnesses and the Ten Great Laws.

For example, declaration, skillful knowledge of workmanship, knowledge of medical prescription, knowledge of causes, knowledge of inner knowledge, etc., these are all wisdom of mundane truth.

If you want to become a Buddha, you must learn all the knowledge. The more you learn, the more beneficial it will be to save sentient beings.

(3) Wisdom for the benefit of all sentient beings
Wisdom for the benefit of all beings is to bestow on all beings the methods of accumulating blessings, doing good and breaking evil, eliminating karma, etc., as well as the wisdom to serve all beings and do things in this life and the next life.

When teaching sentient beings how to do things, you must first have the ability to distinguish which is good and which is bad.

If you don't have this kind of wisdom, you might want to do some good things for sentient beings, but then you will do bad things.

7. Convenient Paramita
When saving sentient beings, according to the different foundations of sentient beings, teach them the suitable method, which is the convenient paramita.

For ordinary people like us, the Three Paths and the Bodhi Path are the most suitable methods. This is the convenient method.

If you practice step by step, you will definitely achieve success. If some people have obtained renunciation in the past or this life, there is no need to teach them about the lower priesthood. It's called convenience.

If you get bodhicitta, you don't need to talk about the three ways, you can talk about the second stage of tantra.

There is also a convenient method. Some people have practiced the method of Guanyin Bodhisattva in the past life. If they can be taught to continue to practice this method in this life, they will easily obtain the blessing of Guanyin Bodhisattva, and the achievement will be faster.

There are also people who have practiced the Dharma doors of Amitabha Buddha, Manjushri Bodhisattva, etc. in their previous lives. Masters with supernatural powers can see which deity a disciple has cultivated in a previous life, and teach him to continue to cultivate this deity in this life. It will be easier to learn and cultivate. This is also a convenient Dharma door.

8. May Paramita
What does May Paramita mean? Seeing the suffering of all beings, the Bodhisattva vows.

For example, the Bodhisattva vowed that all beings in the hungry ghost realm would be able to get food every day; he wished that all beings in the six realms would have their wishes; he wished that all beings would sleep well and not lack food and clothing, and so on.

The power of vows is incredible. With the deepening of practice and the growth of rank, the power of vows will become stronger and stronger, and there will be more and more vows, and eventually they will be realized.

The Kadampa master Bodova often made vows when he was very young.

If you see someone walking, the master will say, "May you arrive safely; if you see a beggar, you will make a vow that he will be fed and clothed."

We generally hope that our enemy will not have his wishes, and that he will never succeed.

This is not the case with Bodhisattvas, because Bodhisattvas have no enemies. Therefore, when some masters make devotions, their vows to dedicate blessings to Bodhisattvas are all fulfilled.

As Shantideva Bodhisattva wrote in The Treatise on Entering Bodhisattva Actions:

The Bodhisattva wishes to do what he wishes, and achieve the benefit of all sentient beings.

If you are willing to know it, the lord cares for you.

If the Bodhisattva's vow is fulfilled, all sentient beings can be free from suffering and attain happiness.

9. Libramido
Power refers to mana, utility.

There are two kinds of power, the power of thinking and the power of practice. The power of thinking and selection is the power of wisdom, and the power of practice is the power of concentration.

There are many expressions of power, such as five powers, ten powers, etc. The function is reflected in the ability to save sentient beings.

10. Wisdom Paramita
Great Wisdom is cultivated by Bodhisattvas above the ground, and includes two types: the wisdom of receiving Dharma and music, and the wisdom of mature sentient beings.

The wisdom of receiving philharmonic is the wisdom that fully understands the characteristics and commonalities of all things.

Mature sentient wisdom refers to the wisdom that can observe the qualities of all living beings and can prescribe the right medicine.

Chapter 11 Inner Reincarnation
"The heart is free of hindrance and no hindrance"

As long as you are not liberated or become a Buddha, you will always be reincarnated in the six realms.

However, the causes of reincarnation are different, there are proximate causes and distant causes.

The far-reaching cause of samsara is the three poisons of greed, hatred, and delusion, especially the greed and hatred caused by ignorance.

The proximate cause of samsara is karma. The karma created by the body, speech, and mind will be pulled by karma. The samsara formed in this way is called inner samsara.

Human beings have 84,000 kinds of afflictions. The root of afflictions lies in the three poisons of greed, hatred, and delusion. Therefore, afflictions are the distant cause of samsara.

However, afflictions can cause karma, and karma can lead to samsara, forming the proximate cause of samsara.

In order to attain liberation, one must remove afflictions and karma.

Once the afflictions are cut off and no karma is created, there will be no reincarnation.

The "obstacles" in the mind mentioned here are afflictions and karma.

The first trouble
There are six root afflictions and twenty secondary afflictions.

1. Six fundamental afflictions
The six root afflictions are: greed, hatred, delusion, arrogance, doubt, and wrong view.

(1) Greed
Greed is greed for what one loves.

When there is greed, the mind will definitely be restless and uncomfortable.

In the Mahayana Abhidhamma Collection, written by the Bodhisattva Insanity, it says: "Covetousness, that is, craving in the world, is said to be inseparable from the object.

"

Among the six root afflictions, "greed" is listed first for a reason.

The six root afflictions can be summed up into the three poisons of greed, hatred, and delusion, and the three poisons can be summed up again into greed. Therefore, greed is the original root of all afflictions.

Greed is also the root cause of our suffering in samsara.

So, if you cut off greed, you can get out of samsara.

(2) anger
Hatred is hatred, hatred of what one does not love, and hatred of things or sentient beings that one does not love. It is hatred and anger towards sentient beings, and the mentality of wanting to hurt others.

For example, seeing an enemy, a rival, etc., the heart becomes extremely angry, eager to hurt the other party.

Sometimes there is also anger towards non-sentient beings, such as getting angry and smashing the cup.

Among all the afflictions, anger is the worst kind, and it is the main culprit that destroys the roots of goodness and falls into the three evil realms.

When anger arises, it is like oil on fire, and there is no time to stop it. Every time anger arises, it can destroy the good deeds and blessings of many kalpas. The fault is extremely serious.

Most of the murders and fights in the world are caused by anger and hatred, and even lead to wars, resulting in the loss of more lives.

How to stop anger? It is necessary to practice forbearance often.

In the Treatise on Entering Bodhisattva Actions, it says:

A stubborn person is like an empty space, how can it be completely subdued, completely destroy this hatred, it is like breaking down all enemies.

It means that there are so many stubborn sentient beings in the world that it is impossible to count them. How could it be possible to subdue them all? However, if you can eliminate your inner hatred, it is like eliminating all external enemies.

And said:

There is nothing more sinful than anger, and nothing more than forbearance.

Therefore, hatred is extremely harmful, and one must cultivate tolerance.

(3) crazy
Ignorance is also known as ignorance, not knowing the true nature of everything is ignorance.

Not understanding the emptiness of dependent origination, not understanding the causes and conditions of the six realms of samsara, afflictions, and suffering, not understanding that human beings have no ego, and dharmas have no ego, all belong to the afflictions of ignorance.

For example, when it was about to get dark, I saw a coil of rope and mistook it for a snake, so I was very scared. This is a typical metaphor about the afflictions of ignorance.

Because there is no understanding of the true face of things (rope), ego (snake) arises. Once attached, many afflictions and pains (fear) arise.

As the ego grows, the stronger the ego, the more karma, and the more afflictions and sufferings that follow.

Delusion is divided into two parts: ego enforcement and law enforcement.

When the ego and the law are broken, other afflictions will be broken naturally, so ignorance is the root of all afflictions.

(4) Slow
Arrogance is arrogance, it is arrogance and complacency, looking down on others.

For example, if I have a little bit of culture, I feel great, and I feel complacent and very proud.

Or if you have a little money, you think a lot of your own money. These are all expressions of arrogance.

A person is often arrogant, and the retribution in the later life will be very bad, and he may become a slave, a servant, a person who serves others.

Every slave or slave is a slave or slave, or servant or servant, because the original karma has not been eliminated when he falls into the evil realm and reincarnates as a human after having created karma in the previous life.

A servant who looks miserable now must be a very arrogant person in a certain life.

(5) Doubt
Doubt is doubt or unbelief, including the inability to believe in the right principles of Buddhism, the power of good and evil karma, and all the real truths in the world, which leads to blocking the door of goodness, breeding wrong views, and creating right and wrong karma.

Doubt is the biggest obstacle to achievement.

Even though the practice is very diligent, doubts gradually arise in the heart, such as doubting whether there is really a cause and effect.

After doing good karma, I wonder if there is such a big blessing as the Buddhist scriptures say, whether doing bad karma really has bad rewards, and so on.

This will make it difficult for good roots and merits to arise, and the practice will become more and more difficult and impossible to achieve.

Cause and effect are true, and everyone will be treated fairly.

Those who study Buddhism and good people will also receive bad retribution. This is the bad karma of the past, which has led to the bad results of today.

Therefore, we should not doubt learning Buddhism, and don’t think that learning Buddhism is useless because learning Buddhism will also suffer bad retribution.

Those who study Buddhism have a chance to be saved even if there is bad retribution.

For example, after many people get terminal illness, they can finally recover through reciting Buddha, doing prostrations, releasing animals, etc.

There are also some kind people whose karma in the previous life made them poor and sick in this life. After learning Buddhism, they were able to eliminate their suffering and be reborn in the Pure Land through the blessing of the Three Jewels.

On the contrary, after the evil retribution of many wicked people is revealed, they lose the chance to be saved.

Some people do bad things, but live very comfortably. This is because of the blessings of their previous lives. Although they have done a lot of bad things in this life, the blessings of the past life are very large and have not been exhausted, so they can continue to maintain them. After the retribution is exhausted, one will fall into the evil realm.

Therefore, one cannot doubt or misunderstand cause and effect. Cause and effect are inconceivable and not so easy to understand.

After the realization of emptiness, even if it is not the realization of the present, but the realization of the emptiness of the quantitative, from then on, there will be no doubt about the cause and effect.

Because after realizing emptiness, the understanding of cause and effect will be very deep, and you will believe in cause and effect without doubt.

The Dhammakaya says:

All dharmas arise from conditions, and all dharmas die from conditions. My Buddha, the great ascetic, always speaks like this.

Buddha talks about dependent origination and emptiness, and believes that all dharmas are dependent origination and are all cause and effect.

We all know that none of the myriad laws and myriads exist independently, but are all interdependent.

For example, a cup is made of many materials, and the ingredients are not single.

At the same time, all things and dharmas are inherently empty, without self-nature, and impermanent.

It's changing every moment, we just can't see it.

After realizing emptiness, all these will be understood. If you realize the truth of impermanence, you will be very close to realizing emptiness.

The deeper and wider the understanding of cause and effect, the more helpful it is to understand emptiness.

Those who truly understand the emptiness of dependent origination do not doubt cause and effect.

People who don't really understand may have doubts if they encounter unsatisfactory things. Therefore, they usually have to study and think hard and understand a little more emptiness, and they will be more suspicious.

Small doubts are common doubts in daily life, and such doubts are also very harmful.

Especially between relatives and friends, it will lead to family and friendship can not last long.

In particular, doubts between friends of law and between senior brothers will be very afflictionsome.

Because there is a common liberation relationship between senior brothers and Dharma friends, when such a relationship exists, there is trust and responsibility between each other, and they feel that they have mutual support.

If there is dissatisfaction and unfounded suspicion between brothers and sisters because of a little thing, it will destroy this kind of relationship.

(6) Incorrect view
Unrighteous views are also called evil views, which refer to views that go against the teachings of Buddhism. They are divided into five types: bad views, marginal views, clinging views, wrong views, and views clinging to views.

1. bad meeting
Bad aggregate view, bad refers to the impermanent five aggregates; aggregate means the concentration of the five aggregates; view is a view that the five aggregates are "I".

This kind of view is not right view, and this kind of non-right view is called bad gathering view.

Clinging to one's own body is the "I", and clinging to the false "I" is the real self.

In fact, it has fallen into the common and constant side, also known as seeing.

Before the realization of emptiness, most people held the view or common, and fewer people fell into stubborn emptiness.

Until you understand emptiness, you will no longer fall into the two sides of detachment and constancy, and realize that the most correct is the middle insight.

2. Side view
Side-attachment to view, side refers to the permanent edge or the broken edge, and the attachment refers to the attachment to the existence of all things, whether it is permanent (eternal) or broken (non-existence).

In the process of searching for emptiness, there will be two kinds of unrighteous views. One kind of view is that if everything exists, then everything must be eternal.

Another kind of unrighteous view is: if everything is impermanent, then everything must not exist.

Those who hold a judgmental view are prone to fall into stubborn emptiness, and in more serious cases, they will develop to the point of not recognizing past and future lives, reincarnation, and cause and effect, thinking that since all things and dharmas are empty, then nothing exists.

Therefore, the most harmful thing among the unrighteous views is the broken view.

Boundary view is an unrighteous view.

Our right view is the right view of the Middle Way, and we take the middle way. To put it simply, there is nothing permanent or non-existent in the universe; everything is impermanent, but it exists.

3. Access
Seeing, as a kind of unrighteous view, is only available to outsiders.

There are two types: refraining from taking views, and practicing prohibiting taking views.

Forbidden to take views, some heretics believe that the Lord of the world is the King of Great Freedom or the King of Brahma. In order to obtain liberation, one must devote allegiance to the Lord.

The way to offer loyalty is to commit suicide, or kill one's own children, lover, or even one's benefactor. This is called abstinence.

Forming precepts based on wrong and delusional views, such precepts are naturally evil precepts.

The prohibition of taking opinions refers to some misunderstandings and behaviors of foreigners in their behavior.

For example, some heretics think that being naked is the only way to get rid of them, so they stay naked all day long; there are other outsiders who stand on one leg all day, from sunrise to sunset, watching the sun all the time, thinking that this will lead to liberation.

There are also some heretics who hold the ox precept, the dog precept, the chicken precept, etc. Because they have some supernatural powers, when they see some chickens and dogs ascend to heaven after they die, they think they are freed, and they are very envious.

But they didn't understand that these animals ascended to heaven because of their own karma and karma. They thought it was because of some behavioral habits of animals that were different from those of humans, so they demanded themselves according to the life characteristics of these animals. Like a chicken, it stands on one leg; those who hold the ox precept will imitate an ox to lower its head to eat grass and so on.

These are all prohibitions.

4. Wrong view
Wrong view is wrong view.

For example, not believing in the Dharma and cause and effect, and reversing good and evil are all wrong views.

5. See and See
Seeing and fetching views, the first view refers to the “bad view, side-attached view, and wrong view” mentioned earlier.

Clinging is clinging to and not letting go, which is a wrong view that is true to the three kinds of unrighteous views mentioned above.

This view is also called "not-fruit-planning", which is the illusion that one has not yet attained the holy fruit, but is delusional about having obtained the holy fruit.

2. Twenty Suffering afflictions

Accompanying afflictions, also known as afflictions of sleep and afflictions, are afflictions that arise along with the root afflictions.

There are twenty kinds of afflictions that follow: anger, hatred, anger, harm, jealousy, slander, flattery, arrogance, arrogance, no shame, no shame, unbelief, laziness, laziness, drowsiness, loss of thought, distraction, delusion, disobedience Knowing.

(1) Anger
Anger is anger, and the object is the situation in front of you that is contrary to your own heart.

For example, when encountering people, things, environments, events, etc. that are not pleasing to the eye, they lose their temper.

How to deal with anger? After getting angry, think more about the fault of losing your temper, or deal with the anger by practicing forbearance.

Make a vow first, for example, get up early every day and make a vow: I will practice tolerance today, and if others scold me or blame me, I will not lose my temper.

This vow will also effectively deal with anger.

(2) Hate
There are nine objects of hatred, divided into three categories.

The first category is to hate those who have hurt me before, are hurting me now, and will hurt me in the future.

The second category is to hate those who have harmed my relatives and friends before, are harming my relatives and friends now, and will harm my relatives and friends in the future.

The third category is to hate those who have helped my enemies before, are helping my enemies now, and will help my enemies in the future.

When I think of these people, I will never forget the harm that these people have brought to me, or may have caused me, and even think of revenge. To have such a mentality is hatred.

Anger is a state of anger and anger towards the immediate situation, that is, the people, things, and things in front of you.

Hate is generally a state of mind about people and things that happened in the past.

(3) Annoyed
Anxiety is hot anxiety, which is a state of being irritable and restless about the situation in front of you that makes you unhappy.

Sometimes, the mentality of anger and hatred continues to expand, the more I think about it, the more uncomfortable it becomes, the heartbeat speeds up, and it starts to become irritable, which will also become irritable.

Even getting angry enough to throw things, scold or hit people, it also adds trouble to others.

Cultivation of forbearance can cure anger.

(4) Harm
To harm is to harm all beings.

On the one hand, after the agitation arises, one loses compassion and has a more intense impulse to persecute sentient beings by beating, killing, intimidating and other acts.

On the other hand, some people have heavy karma and lack compassion, and even if they are not disturbed by anger and anger, they will harm people and sentient beings for no reason.

For example, some people will kick a dog when they meet a dog on the side of the road, or often destroy things for no reason.

Harm is not actually harming others, but harming yourself.

Harmful thoughts are together, it is a big karma, and the result is that you will often inspire others to harm you.

Therefore, once a harmful thought arises, it must be cut off immediately, otherwise, this kind of thought will harm oneself forever.

(5) Jealousy
Jealousy is seeing other people's beauty, health, wealth, happiness, success, merit and other aspects surpassing one's own, and feeling uncomfortable and unbalanced in the heart. This kind of mentality is jealousy.

For those who are worse than you, the affliction that is easy to arise is arrogance, and it is easy to be jealous of those who are better than yourself.

The antidote to jealousy is to cultivate loving-kindness. Jealousy is a manifestation of lack of loving-kindness. If you have loving-kindness for someone, you will not be jealous of the other person.

In addition, regular practice of rejoicing can also counteract jealousy.

(6) Falsehood
There are two kinds of deceit, one is false exaggeration; the other is to pretend to have no ability or merit but to pretend with words and deeds.

The purpose is to seek fame and fortune.

For example, if you have no ability, but pretend you have the ability to do something; or if you don’t have merit, say you have merit; if you don’t have supernatural powers, pretend to have supernatural powers;

(7) Flattery
Flattery is to flatter others in order to win their trust, and to hide one's own faults so as not to damage fame and fortune.

To put it simply, flattery means being flattering and flattering others for the sake of fame and fortune.

Flattery and lie are both for fame and fortune, but they are not the same.

Falsehood is to gain fame and fortune through deception, and flattery is to preserve one's own fame and fortune through flattery and flattery.

(8) Cover
To cover is to hide sin.

Fu itself does not create karma in words and deeds, but for the evil karma that was done in the past, for the sake of fame and fortune, deliberately concealing one's own faults and not letting others know.

The greatest harm of overthrow and flattery is that karma cannot be eliminated.

If you want to get rid of karma, you must tell the karma, and then repent.

After hiding the sins, the karma grows equally every day.

Therefore, we should try our best to speak out the karma that we can remember in front of Buddhas, Bodhisattvas and teachers, and repent.

(9) Pride
Pride means to think that one's appearance, status, wealth, knowledge, status, etc. are superior to others.

When you have this kind of mentality, you will look down on others, and you will not see the merits of others, and it is easy to slander the teachings and saints.

There are many people in the world who are more dignified in appearance, noble in race, wealthier, more learned, and higher in status than themselves. If you think about these things often, you will not feel arrogant.

"Pride" is not the same as "arrogance" in the six root afflictions. Pride is a kind of arrogance produced by oneself.

Slowness is when you compare yourself with others, you think you are superior to others, and you look down on others.

(10) Save money
To be stingy is to be stingy, to be reluctant to give up on anything and to hold on tight.

Saving is formed by greed, but saving and greed are also different.

Covetousness means wanting more. Covetous people do not necessarily save money. Covetous people only hope that their wealth will continue to increase, but when others have needs, they may give out, or even take the initiative to give because they are greedy for merit and blessings.

To save is to have and be reluctant to give to others. Those who save are bound to be greedy, because those who save are reluctant to give up anything, even their own possessions are reluctant to use for themselves, let alone share with others.

(11) No shame
Shameless means that there is no shame in one's own faults, no self-respect, and dare to do evil things.

As Buddhist disciples, we must respect ourselves and love ourselves, constantly examine ourselves, and repent in time when we make mistakes.

(12) Worthless
It is true that when one's faults are criticized and criticized by others, they are not ashamed, and they are not afraid of being sorry to others.

People who are worthy of shame and who don't care about their face will be looked down upon by everyone, and they will also lose the possibility of repenting their bad karma.

(13) Do not believe
Unbelief refers to unbelief caused by an impure mind and inability to correctly understand the Three Jewels, cause and effect, and reincarnation of the six realms.

The essence of unbelief is ignorance, ignorance and ignorance caused by weak roots of goodness and deep karma.

They only believe in the visible cause and effect of the world, not in the invisible cause and effect of good and evil, nor in the Three Jewels and reincarnation.

This kind of unbelief is not acquired by studying the scriptures, but is caused by misunderstandings about causality, reincarnation, etc., and is stubborn and unrepentant.

Not believing in cause and effect is very scary, because not believing in cause and effect means no self-discipline.

In this way, any evil deed may be done, which will induce greater and more suffering.

100% of the future generations will fall into the evil realm and suffer from purgatory.

(14) Laziness
Laziness is laziness.

Laziness is divided into two aspects: unwillingness to do good deeds is a type of laziness; unwillingness to eliminate evil deeds is another type of laziness.

For example, when it comes to good things such as listening, thinking, and cultivating, they are unwilling to listen, think, and practice diligently. When it comes to bad things, such as gluttony and sleepiness, they are very longing for them and are unwilling to stop them.

To deal with slack, we must think more about the impermanence of life and the fact that it is rare to be full of time.

Think about yourself: You have obtained such a rare human body, you can't waste it, you have to be diligent.

If you keep thinking like this, you truly understand these principles, and after you have developed firm beliefs, you will naturally be diligent, but compulsive diligence is useless.

Yuecheng Bodhisattva said in "Entering the Middle Treatise":

When you are free in a favorable situation, if you don't take the opportunity to save yourself, and you fall into the abyss and lose your freedom, who will save you then?

Therefore, while you have obtained a human body of leisure and life, and have not fallen into the evil realm, you should seize the time to save yourself, practice diligently, and not be lazy or slack.

(15) Let go
Laissez-faire is chaos, the mentality of not caring about anything.

For example, seeing someone very happy after a relapse, I yearn for it very much, and I have the idea that everyone else has relapsed and I don’t care. This kind of mentality is called letting go.

Because you don't care about anything, if you don't do the good things you should do, you won't be able to increase your good deeds and blessings.

They do not care about the afflictions and karma of the countermeasures, do not control them, and allow their words and deeds to be driven by greed, hatred, and delusion.

Therefore, the Buddha believes that letting loose is the root of all afflictions, which will gradually reduce the original merits of hearing, thinking, and cultivation, while greed, hatred, and delusion will increase day by day.

(16) drowsy
Drowsiness is a state of mind of wanting to sleep.

When studying, there is not enough mental energy to keep the content of meditation clear and confused, which will hinder achievement.

In the process of studying and cultivating, when drowsiness occurs, think more about the merits of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas, and motivate yourself, and your mind will be clear.

If that doesn't work, stand up, wash your face with cold water, or pinch yourself.

In order to prevent drowsiness, the masters of the Nyingma School in Tibet used to have a long braid, and they hung the braid somewhere when they were chanting sutras.

When I studied with Dharma King Yongzeng, a young living Buddha also came to listen to Dharma King's sermons with his master.

This master was very strict. When Dharma King Yongzeng was teaching the sutras, this master was sitting behind the living Buddha. When he saw that the living Buddha was drowsy and was about to fall asleep, he immediately pinched him.

Dharma King Yongzeng taught the sutras for a long time, often for six or seven hours, and the master kept pinching himself, the living Buddha disciple.

These are all things we should learn.

(17) Loss of mind
Losing one's mind is also called forgetting one's mind, which means to lose the righteous mind, that is, to forget the good Dharma.

For example, when meditating, but forgetting the teacher's teaching, it is a kind of forgetfulness.

The reason for the loss of mind is that the mind follows the delusion and loses the right mind.

Delusions are random thoughts caused by various afflictions. If you don't pay attention to the treatment, the delusions will become more and more, and the memory will become more and more degraded.

(18) Scattered
Distraction is a state of mind in which thoughts are scattered, delusional thoughts are flying, and never stop.

A big reason for distraction is because of loss of mind, but it is still different from loss of mind.

Dispersion is due to the flying of delusional thoughts, and the thoughts begin to be scattered and scattered. Not only can they not clearly remember the situation just now, but also the thoughts are constantly changing, thinking about this and thinking about that all of a sudden.

Loss of mind is not necessarily like this. Although the mind runs away, it may stop when thinking about something, and it will not keep changing and running.

Our mind is constantly thinking about the outside world, which can cause all kinds of distractions.

Especially the communication tools such as mobile phones of modern people have brought more confusion. Not to mention focusing on one thing, it is impossible to stay in one place quietly for a few minutes, because there are various Miscellaneous thoughts, all kinds of afflictions, plus eating, drinking, playing, and sleeping, the heart can't settle down at all.

The range of distraction is very wide, the thoughts are constantly flying, and the things that are thought of are not divided into the past and the future.

Nor do they think of dealing with them, because many people don’t even know that distraction is also a kind of trouble.

(nineteen) drop
To lose one's mind means that the mind can't be settled, the mind is confused, the mind is running from east to west, up and down.

Therefore, falling out is actually a kind of distraction, but it is different from distraction.

Distraction generally refers to when one is practising meditation, one cannot settle down on the situation under observation, and is always distracted, recalling some good things that happened in the past. But the heart still can't contain it.

(20) Unrighteous knowledge
Unrighteous knowledge means that when doing things, the way of thinking is very unclear and the thinking is chaotic.

In the process of doing things, some people often don't know what they are doing. Such a state is called unrighteous knowledge.

Section 2 Karma

Although karma is caused by defilements, it is mainly created by our body, speech and mind.

Karma is the proximate cause of samsara, and can be divided into Buddha-made sins and self-natured sins.

Buddha-made sins refer to those who accept and uphold the precepts established by the Buddha, who will have sinful karma if they do it.

For example, if you don’t eat after noon, ordinary family members will not have sinful karma if they eat in the afternoon; but practitioners who have taken the eight-point fast cannot eat it.

Self-nature sin means that this kind of karma is originally a kind of sin karma, and it doesn’t need anyone to determine it.

For example, in killing, whoever kills will have sinful karma, and if the Buddha does not make it, it is also sinful.

Common karma generally refers to the karma caused by the ten evil karma.

The ten evil karmas are: killing, stealing, sexual misconduct, lying, gossip, bad speech, flattery, greed, hatred, and wrong views.

1. Killing
Serious killing means killing arhats, fathers and mothers, and killing; moderate killings means killing large animals; mild killings means killing small animals.

In addition, there is no difference between letting others kill and committing suicide by yourself, and instigating others to kill is more serious.

As it is said in the Kosher:

If the military and other colleagues are colleagues, they are all like authors.

As a result of killing, in the next life, one will fall into the three evil realms, and in this life, one will be sick, weak, and short-lived.

2. Theft
To steal is to steal what belongs to the Lord.

If it is unowned, it is not considered theft.

Serious theft is stealing the property of the Three Treasures, or stealing valuables; moderate theft is stealing from the poor; petty theft is stealing small money, lack of business, and so on.

The result of stealing is poverty, and it will be poor in every life.

Because stealing cuts off the cause of making a fortune, wisdom, conditions and other aspects are the predestined conditions for making a fortune.

If there is no cause, the cause will not work, so there will be poverty.

Another consequence of stealing is losing money.

Your own things often disappear for no reason, or your money is stolen or defrauded by others.

The number of thieves in the world increases, the harvest of crops will decrease, and disasters such as drought, frost, and hail will often occur. These are the consequences of stealing.

3. Evil
Fornication is a relationship between a man and a woman other than a husband and wife.

Serious adultery will go to hell.

The target of licentiousness is monks, and they will definitely go to hell in the next life.

A moderate level of sexual misconduct will fall into the realm of hungry ghosts in future generations. For example, the target of sexual misconduct is someone who has a relationship with him within three generations; or sexual misconduct after marriage; or a husband and wife act in front of a Buddha statue, and the Buddha statue is not placed in the bedroom. This is the reason.

A small licentiousness will fall into the realm of beasts.

Four, lies
False speech is to speak deceitful words with greed, hatred, and delusion as the motivation. The target of the speech is a normal person who can understand and have a normal ability to understand.

There are many kinds of lies, and the most serious lies are the teaching of the Law of the Supreme Being.

The Dharma of the Master is to falsely claim that one has the merits and virtues of the first jhana and above, and falsely claim to have supernatural merits and abilities. The result of such a big lie will go to hell.

A moderate level of lying is to deceive monks, parents, and benefactors.

There are a lot of small lies, including cheating money, deceiving people, etc., and later generations will also fall into the evil realm.

The result of lying is that there are often liars around, and no one will believe what you say, even if it makes sense, no one will believe it.

They are often wronged. For example, some people who did not commit a crime were framed or even imprisoned. This is the result of lying in a previous life.

Therefore, when we are wronged by others, we must understand that this is a kind of retribution, and think in our hearts: This is the retribution of my previous lies.

Five, two tongues
Two tongues are to sow discord.

The more serious two tongues are in the monasteries, when talking among the sangha to sow discord, don't underestimate this verbal karma, this kind of karma is easy to create, the retribution will be very bad, and it will lead to the betrayal of relatives and friends. When you are old, you will be ignored, and your own children will not be cared for, and you will die alone.

You need to be very, very careful about this kind of sowing discord, and it is easy for lay people to create this kind of karma.

The general level of two tongues is the words between husband and wife and friends to sow discord. The result is to cause relatives and friends to stay away or fight against each other. People around them cannot get along in harmony, and they will live in places with uneven terrain.

6. Bad mouth
Evil is swearing.

If you scold Buddhas, Bodhisattvas and teachers, the result in the next life will be going to hell. This is a very serious slander.

If you scold your parents, it is also a huge karma, and there will be very painful retribution.

In addition, because you have once scolded others, you will also be scolded and hated by others, and your voice will often be hoarse. Chronic pharyngitis is the result of bad words in previous lives.

Seven, eloquence
To speak eloquently is to say right and wrong, to speak ill of this person, and to speak ill of that person.

If there are a lot of slang-speakers in an area, strange things can happen, such as if the tree doesn't bear fruit on time, or ripens at a season when it shouldn't.

The consequence of speaking eloquently is that the language expression has no value and does not receive the respect it deserves.

The same words have different effects when spoken by different people. People who don’t speak right and wrong have more influence and prestige, and people will listen to them.

8. Greed
There is a difference between greed and greed.

"Greed" is not necessarily bad. For example, we are greedy for rebirth in the Land of Ultimate Bliss, so we often recite Amitabha Buddha.

If you are greedy for the Buddha, you will study the Buddha, and if you are greedy for the Dharma, you will cultivate the Dharma. There is nothing wrong with this.

What is greed? A great desire for one's own and other's possessions is greed.

Greed has five characteristics:

There is worry: especially indulging in nostalgia for one's own wealth.

Greedy: Always eager for wealth growth, only accumulation, reluctance to use.

Have a gluttonous heart: deeply envious and coveted the wealth of others.

scheming: always thinking about how to take possession of other people's wealth.

There is a veiled mind: the mind is full of greed, without feeling ashamed, ashamed, and without awakening.

With these five characteristics, it is greed in the ten evil karma.

The result of greed is that what you want is not what you want.

If you can't get what you want, you will often encounter people or things you hate.

9. Anger
Anger is the biggest karma among the ten evil karmas.

Anger means losing your temper and getting angry, and anger can easily eliminate the blessings.

Great results of anger usually go to hell.

For example, if you are angry with a Buddha or Bodhisattva, if you are angry with a Bodhisattva who has attained the earth, the blessings accumulated over a hundred kalpas will be eliminated in an instant, and you will go to hell in the next life, and you will stay in hell for another hundred kalpas. If the opponent is a bodhisattva from eight or more lands, he will eliminate the blessings of a thousand kalpas at once, and he will spend a thousand kalpas in hell; if he is angry with ordinary bodhisattvas, he can eliminate the blessings of one kalpa, and he will stay in hell for one kalpa. robbery.

Therefore, we must never be angry with Buddhas and Bodhisattvas, because we do not know who Bodhisattvas are, so it is easy to create such bad karma.

If you develop anger towards your teacher, you will wipe out all the blessings accumulated over a kalpa.

Being angry with people, parents, and relatives who are kind to oneself will also eliminate the blessings of a few years.

Even being angry with ordinary people will wipe out the blessings that you have worked so hard to accumulate over a period of time.

In addition to the blessings that have been dedicated and the blessings of emptiness, the general blessings, such as prostration and Buddha recitation, will be eliminated.

Anger not only destroys good fortune, but also leads to internal poison, which leads to aging and ugliness.

So we must deal with anger, or be able to control it.

10. Perseverance
Clinging to wrong views is stubbornly holding on to upside-down ideas.

Bad things are considered good; good things are considered bad.

I feel that what exists does not exist, and what does not feel exists.

This is a wrong view, an upside-down notion.

Once you have wrong views, everything you do will be wrong.

After a person clings to a wrong view, his character will become crooked, he will become more paranoid, he will spend his whole life in the inversion of right and wrong, and he will go to hell in the next life.

In addition to being confused by oneself, it can also affect others, harming oneself and others, but cannot be aware of it.

When there are many people in the world who hold wrong views, water and mineral resources will disappear.

Gold mines and silver mines will gradually disappear, gold will turn into stone, and good things will become bad or disappear. These are the results of clinging to wrong views.

Section 3 Obstacles
"No terror"

The "horror" here includes 84,000 demonic obstacles, 360 ghosts and gods, and 15 boy demonic obstacles.

In other respects, disasters as big as earth, water, fire and wind, as small as various diseases in this world, not being able to find a job, old age and death, etc., will all cause terror.

The root of terror is defilement and karma.

Once the afflictions are cut off and the karmic obstacles are eliminated, the causes and conditions that cause these horrors will also be cut off, and the horror will naturally be eliminated.

Fourth quarter four upside down
"Far From Upside Down Dreams"

Inversion is unrighteous view and delusion. The most common delusion of ordinary people is attachment to the four inverted views.

Because of ignorance, ordinary people do not know that the truth of all things in the world is impermanence, suffering, non-self, and impurity. There are four inversions of delusional attachment: impermanence is permanent, suffering is happiness, non-self is self, and impure is pure.

Impermanence is permanent Everything is impermanent, and life is also impermanent.

The idea that I am eternal and constant is the idea of ​​upside down.

Life is impermanent, people are bound to die, and they die indefinitely.

In the past, Qin Shihuang became an emperor, but he was not satisfied and wanted to live to be a hundred years old, so he added a "white character" to the word "king", and he became "emperor", which is how the word "emperor" came from.

what does it mean? Qin Shi Huang wanted to be king until his hair was white, but he died before his hair was white.

Taking impermanence as permanent is an upside-down dream.

Take suffering as pleasure, and take suffering and become suffering as pleasure.

For example, eating, eating reduces the pain of hunger, so ordinary people think that it is a kind of happiness, but in fact it is a kind of suffering.

why? After the food is eaten in the stomach, after the hunger satisfaction is over, it will bring more suffering.

Eating bad will cause stomach pain, eating too much will cause stomach pain, and there will be trouble with defecation. Unhealthy diet will also bring disease.

When eating, the food is chewed and chewed with saliva in the mouth. It has long been out of shape. When you see it, you will definitely be reluctant to eat it. If you think about it carefully, you will find that it is originally a kind of bitterness.

Another example is licentiousness. The pleasure of licentiousness is impermanent, and in itself is a kind of suffering, which will bring about a lot of emotional and physical pain when it passes.

But we rejoice in suffering, so it is the other way around.

No-self for me The "I" we usually think is an imagination, and there is no "I" that can be established on the five aggregates. This false "I" does not exist, but we always think that there is a real "I". "I" exist.

Such an understanding is an upside-down idea.

Impure to purify body and mind is impure, but we consider it pure.

According to the Buddhist scriptures, there are thirty-six kinds of impurity in the body.

Twelve external things: hair, hair, claws, teeth, claw, tears, saliva, saliva, feces, urine, dirt, and sweat.

Twelve objects of the body: skin, skin, blood, flesh, tendons, veins, bones, marrow, fat, cream, brain, and membranes.

It contains twelve substances: liver, gallbladder, intestine, stomach, spleen, kidney, heart, lung, raw viscera, cooked viscera, red phlegm, and white phlegm.

If you think carefully about these thirty-six kinds of unclean things, you will find that both inside and outside the body are unclean, but we always take the unclean as the clean.

Each of us has these upside-down dreams and concepts. Once we understand these, we don’t have to be too attached to it in our life, such as clinging to ourselves for being clean, blaming others for being unclean, and so on.

We can only do this now, and we can't do it if we want to completely reverse it.

Chapter Twelve Nirvana
Section 1 The Four Nirvanas
"Exactly Nirvana"

Nirvana is Sanskrit, which means freedom from suffering, and simply means liberation. Master Xuanzang translated it as quanji, which means complete tranquility, possessing all merits and wisdom as "round", and forever free from all afflictions, life and death, as "quiet".

There are four kinds of Nirvana:

Remaining Nirvana The Nirvana before the arhat passed away is called Remaining Nirvana.

For example, the saints such as Sariputra and Muggallana were ordinary people when they first met Buddha Shakyamuni. After the Buddha taught them the Dharma, they eliminated their afflictions through practice and attained the status of Arhats.

The stage from the day they become an arhat to the time of passing away is called nirvana.

After the arhat of No Remaining Nirvana passes away, he obtains a light body of consciousness and wisdom as high as a child of eight or nine years old, which is called No Remaining Nirvana.

Arhats such as Sariputra and Muggallana are currently in Nirvana without remainder.

Self-nature Nirvana Self-nature Nirvana is emptiness.

Abstinence Nirvana Abstinence Nirvana is the fruit of Buddhahood, and the "ultimate Nirvana" mentioned here refers to Abstinence Nirvana.

The vajra metaphor of ultimate yoga in the final stage of the Bodhisattva's cultivation can break all obstacles to understanding, even the most subtle obstacles to understanding.

When the two obscurations are cut off, one becomes a Buddha, and when one obtains all the universal wisdom and the four bodies of a Buddha, one obtains nirvana without abiding.

All-pervasive wisdom refers to the wisdom that can understand all the sufferings and afflictions of sentient beings in the six realms, and access all the methods of solving suffering, eliminating afflictions, eliminating obscurations, accumulating blessings, etc. It is the wisdom possessed by Buddhas.

Section 2 The Fruit Status of the Three Buddhas

"The reason why the Buddhas of the Three Worlds Rely on Prajnaparamita"

"Buddhas of the Three Times": Buddhas of the past, Buddhas of the present, and Buddhas of the future.

They all rely on Prajnaparamita to attain Buddhahood.

Prajna Paramita is the mother of all Buddhas, and Prajna Brahma is the Heart Sutra.

After attaining Buddhahood, you will obtain the merits and virtues of the Buddha's four bodies, namely, the body of retribution, the body of incarnation, the body of the law, and the body of self-nature.

1. The Buddha’s Retribution Body
The Buddha's sambhogakaya is a kind of eternal life, an immortal being with thirty-two and eighty sublime signs.

Freed from birth, old age, sickness, and death, life is eternal and will never pass away.

The sambhogakaya has five characteristics: first, life is eternal; second, its appearance is solemn, with thirty-two and eighty-sixty-like and solemn features; third, the retinues are all bodhisattvas who have ascended to the ground, and ordinary eyes cannot see them. Sambhogakaya cannot be seen by Bodhisattvas who are on the Mahayana Accumulation Path or the Path of Complementary Practices. Only Bodhisattvas who have seen the path above can see it. Fourth, they only teach the Mahayana Dharma, not the Lesser Vehicle. Fifth, they abide in the supreme secret. Brass.

The incarnation of Buddha
The incarnation of the Buddha is the incarnation of the Sambhogakaya. There is not a great asan kalpa without the blessings of seeing the Buddha's Sambhogakaya, let alone hearing the Mahayana door taught by the Sambhogakaya.

Therefore, in order to save sentient beings who have no fate or immature fate with the Buddha's Sambhogakaya, various incarnations have been created from the Buddha's Sambhogakaya.

The incarnation of the Buddha can be divided into three types: the incarnation of the supreme, the incarnation of the received life, and the incarnation of the business.

The supreme incarnation Shakyamuni Buddha is the supreme incarnation of the retribution body. Why is it called the supreme incarnation? This is because some aspects of this incarnation are the same as the Sambhogakaya, such as a very solemn appearance, sixty-four language merits, and so on.

The karmic conditions for saving sentient beings and special incarnations are different.

There are those who have a karmic relationship with the special incarnation, and the sentient beings who have matured fate with the Buddha can see the special incarnation.

There are karmic conditions for the teachings of the special incarnations.

There are also holy objects such as relics of the special incarnation, and holy places of practice that have karmic karma.

When the supreme incarnation has finished saving these sentient beings who have the karmic condition for his personal salvation, the sambhogakaya will take back the extraordinary incarnation, and the Buddha will appear in the world and pass away.

Some people do not understand the passing away of the Buddha, thinking that the Buddha is dead, that even the Buddha has no way to get rid of death, and that it is useless to study the Buddha.

In fact, it is the incarnation of the Buddha who passes away, and the Buddha's retribution body is eternal and immortal.

After the Buddha passed away, the Buddha's teachings can survive for 5,500 years, which means that it can benefit all beings for 5,500 years.

During this period, those who studied Buddhism were all sentient beings who had a karmic relationship with the Buddha's teachings, such as us now.

Five thousand five hundred years later, the Buddhadharma will cease to exist.

But there are also sentient beings who have the karmic relationship with the Buddha's relics. They will save and make offerings to the Buddha's relics and receive the blessings of the relics. If the karma of these sentient beings and the Buddha's relics is also exhausted, the relics will become wish-fulfilling treasures.

When the supreme incarnation teaches sutras, both Mahayana and Hinayana scriptures will be taught.

Because Shakyamuni Buddha is a supreme incarnation, his retinue includes both Mahayana and Hinayana.

The incarnation of rebirth is the appearance of ordinary sentient beings transformed by the Buddha's Sambhogakaya in order to save sentient beings.

Ordinary people don’t even have the predestined fate and blessings to see the supreme incarnation, let alone the retribution body of a Buddha, so the Buddha transforms into various incarnations to teach and transform all beings.

That is to say, some sentient beings cannot see the Buddha's extraordinary incarnation, so the Buddha sees what appearance these sentient beings can accept, and transforms that appearance to save them.

All sentient beings who have a predestined relationship with the Buddha can see the Buddha's rebirth incarnation, but they may not necessarily recognize him as a Buddha.

In order to save human beings, Buddhas will transform into human appearances, such as real living Buddhas in Tibetan areas.

In order to save the sentient beings of hungry ghosts, the Buddha will transform into the appearance of hungry ghosts, such as the king of hungry ghosts.

In order to transform the animal realm, it will transform into the animal appearance, such as the throated blue bird in the "Jinwen Dawa Biography" and so on.

When Buddhas and Bodhisattvas save sentient beings, they can have countless manifestations. Whatever they want to manifest, they can manifest in an instant.

In order to benefit all living beings, Buddha incarnates the incarnation of various undertakings, for example, in order to save the king of Xunxiang, he became the king of Pipa.

In order to make the image of Buddha Shakyamuni, he turned it into Buxiugama and so on.

The Nyingma School believes that the Buddha statue in which the Consecrated Wisdom Zun resides is also the embodiment of career.

All sentient beings who have a predestined relationship with the Buddha can receive various benefits of the Buddha's career incarnation.

3. The Dharma Body of the Buddha
Dharmakaya is the great wisdom of the Buddha, and it is all knowledge.

Wisdom can transform into the body of a Buddha, so it is said that the wisdom of the Buddha is everywhere, and the Buddha is everywhere.

4. The Self-nature Body of Buddha
The self-nature body is the true body of the Buddha, the original appearance of the mind.

Because the self-nature body is the ultimate nirvana where the self-nature is pure and the guest dust is pure, so, after being fully enlightened, after realizing the ultimate nirvana, you really get the self-nature body.

At the same time, the Buddha has the merits of the four bodies.

After understanding the merits and virtues of the Buddha's four bodies, let's think about it again: only after becoming a Buddha can we have such merits, so as to motivate ourselves to develop bodhicitta, we will practice more diligently and attain bodhicitta faster.

The third section is full of fruit
"Attaining Anuttara-Samyaksambodhi"

Anuttara-samyaksambodhi is a Sanskrit word, "Anu" means supreme, "tara" means perfection, and "samyaksambodhi" means perfect enlightenment.

In the Heart Sutra translated by Master Facheng, it is translated as "obtaining the righteous Bodhi".

True Bodhi is the fruit of Buddhahood, the omniscience of all.

All omniscience is supreme, right and enlightened, and the most perfect fruit.

Chapter Thirteen Spells
The merits of the first mantra
"That's why we know that Prajna Paramita is a great divine mantra, a great bright mantra, a supreme mantra, and an inexhaustible mantra that can remove all suffering. It is true and not false."

The "so to know Prajna Paramita" here is translated in the version of "Heart Sutra" translated by Master Facheng as "therefore one should know the great secret mantra of Prajna Paramita", and in the Tibetan version of "Heart Sutra", it is translated as "Therefore one should know the truth, Prajnaparamita Mantra".

Therefore, this sentence should be "so I know the prajna-paramita mantra", not "so I know the prajna-paramita".

The Sanskrit word for "mantra" is "Dharani", which translates as a mantra and also means "rescue".

Mantra is the Buddha's Wisdom Dharma Body. Because sentient beings cannot directly contact the Buddha's Wisdom Dharma Body, the Buddha's Wisdom Dharma Body is transformed into mantras, and reciting the mantra can be blessed by the Buddha's body, speech, and mind.

Once you have cultivated to a certain level, you can realize emptiness.

Therefore, there are many people who recite mantras in Tibet. Some people have recited them tens of millions of times, while others have recited them hundreds of millions of times.

The "prajnaparamita mantra" here is the cause of the Buddha's dharma body, and the mantra that manifests the Buddha's wisdom of emptiness is the prajnaparamita mantra.

If you recite this mantra, your wishes will come true, and your breath will be fulfilled and you will gain four kinds of merits.

It can also remove the interference of demons and outsiders, and achieve great Bodhi.

"It's the Great God Mantra", "Great God" is the Buddha, Bodhisattva or the deity. After reciting the mantra of the Heart Sutra, the mantra of the Buddha, Bodhisattva and the deity is recited. The merits and virtues are the same, and they can achieve many careers.

The "Heart Sutra" translated by Master Kumarajiva and the Tibetan "Heart Sutra" does not have the phrase "is the Great God Mantra", but in the "Heart Sutra" translated by Sanzang Prajna and Xuanzang, and translated by Fayue and Prajna. The Heart Sutra also has this sentence.

Some people say that there is no such verse in the Heart Sutra, but Master Xuanzang deliberately added it.

"It's the Great Bright Mantra", Prajna Wisdom is Great Brightness, which can eliminate ignorance and afflictions.

"It is the supreme mantra", apart from this mantra, there is no other superior mantra, which means that there is no mantra that is more superior to the Prajnaparamita mantra.

"It is the Mantra of No Equals". "No Equals" means that there is no equality. Buddhas are incomparable, and they are the most perfect and extraordinary.

The second "equal" means equality, which means that Buddhas and ordinary people are equal in Buddha-nature and on the basis of emptiness.

The Bodhisattva in the cultivation position is equal to the Buddha in the realization of emptiness, and the ordinary people who realize the emptiness are also equal to the Buddha in emptiness.

"It can remove all suffering", Prajna Paramita can remove all suffering, the root of suffering is affliction, if according to Prajna Paramita, you realize emptiness, realize that people have no ego, the law has no ego, and even the habit of affliction can be cut off. Therefore, it is called "can remove all suffering".

"True and not false" means not false.

It means that it is true and true that Yiprajna Paramita can remove all suffering. This is a layer of meaning.

Another meaning is that in the samadhi of realizing emptiness according to Prajnaparamita, it is far away from the jokes of the mundane truth, and the attachment to the ego and the law is broken, and the rest is the true face of things, the real The nature of is "truth is not false".

The most accurate way to recite mantras in the second section of the Heart Sutra
"So saying the Prajna Paramita mantra means saying the mantra, Dayata Om Gatti Gati Balangati Balan Sen Gatti Potisoha"

The pronunciation of mantras
The seven Chinese translations of the Heart Sutra have mantras, which can be read in various ways.

The incantation of the version of the Heart Sutra translated by Yaoqin Sanzang Master Kumarajiva is:

The incantation of the version of the Heart Sutra translated by Master Xuanzang in the Tang Dynasty is: Gaiti Gadi Paragadi Parasang Gaiti Bodhi Shapoha

The mantra in the version of the Heart Sutra translated by Master Fayue in the Tang Dynasty is: Jieti Jade Palakati Pharasang Jade Bodhi Shapoha

The mantra in the version of the Heart Sutra translated by Master Sanzang Prajna in the Tang Dynasty is:

Tiller Di Tiller Di Para, Tiller Di Para Sangha, Tiller Di Bodhi Sapo He

The mantra in the version of the Heart Sutra translated by Master Wisdom Wheel in the Tang Dynasty is:

Emperor Ompi

The mantra in the version of the Heart Sutra translated by Master Facheng in the Tang Dynasty is:

Edi Edi Bo La Edi Bo La Monk Edi Bodhi Shaho

The incantation in the version of the Heart Sutra translated by Master Shi Hu in the Song Dynasty is: Dahantaom Banner Emperor Banner Emperor Bola Banner Emperor Bola Seng Banner Emperor Mao Tishahe

The mantra version of the Tibetan "Heart Sutra" is: Dayata Om Gadi Palangati Palang Sen Gadi Potisoha

After thinking and comparison, I think the mantra in the Tibetan version of the Heart Sutra is more accurate. There are several reasons.

(It should be noted that the pronunciation of the word "Ran" is close to the rā of Chinese Pinyin)

Before Buddhism spread to Tibet, Tibet did not have its own culture and no written language. Until about AD 600, Sambuza, a minister of the Tibetan king Songtsen Gampo, created the Tibetan script based on Sanskrit. Among the thirty Tibetan letters, Twenty-four letters and four finals were taken directly from Sanskrit, and Sambuza created another six.

So Tibetans will be more accurate in pronunciation.

In addition, Tibet is very close to India. Many people have been to India for thousands of years. Thousands of masters have been to India to study Buddhism. The pronunciation of these masters is the same, so it is more accurate.

In addition, Buddhist scriptures are relatively well preserved in Tibet.

The Tibetan version of the Heart Sutra has a foreword, text, and conclusion, while the Heart Sutra translated by Master Xuanzang has only the text.

The Tibetan "Heart Sutra" has this sentence "Therefore you should know the truth, the Prajna Paramita mantra", some of the Chinese translations here are translated as "So you know the Prajna Paramita", and some have "Great Mantra" and other scriptures, Neither is complete.

Judging from the pronunciation of mantras, the pronunciation of mantras in the seven Chinese versions is actually similar. Because the official languages ​​of different dynasties are not exactly the same, different characters appear.

The mantra translated by Master Xuanzang is read in the official language of the Tang Dynasty, which is basically the same as the reading in Tibetan.

Today's Hokkien is the official language of the Tang Dynasty, and it has not changed much.

In Hokkien, the pronunciation of "Jieti Jieti Parajati Parasang Jieti Bodhi Shapoha" is the same as that of Tibetan, and the Hokkien reading "Jieti" is "Gadi".

In other respects, the incantations translated by Master Shihu include "Dahanta", the Tibetan "Heart Sutra" has "Dayata", and the "Heart Sutra" incantations translated by Master Shihu and Wisdom Lun include "Om". "Heart Sutra" corresponds to "Om".

So, in every way, these versions of the spell are the same.

The meaning of the mantra
"Dayata Om Gati Gati Balangati Balang Sen Gati Potisoha"

We explain according to the mantras in the Tibetan version of the Heart Sutra.

"Dayata" means "as is".

"Om", this "Om" represents the body, speech and mind of the Buddha.

Because the Sanskrit "Om" has three characters: Ah, Oh, and Well, these three characters represent the Buddha's body, speech, and mind respectively.

When you recite "Om", you are remembering the merits of the Buddha's body, speech, and thoughts, and getting the Buddha's blessing.

The body, speech, and mind of thinking of the Buddha have eight virtues: special, wealth, blessing and wisdom, wealth source, wisdom root, vows, auspiciousness, and wishful thinking.

"Gadi Gadi", the meaning of the word above is "Go! Go quickly".

Where to go? The first "Gadi" is to go to the resource road.

Including the lower, middle, and upper quality paths of the Shravaka, the Awakened, and the Bodhisattva, the practice of the lower three parts of Tantra and the birth order of the supreme yoga part are also concentrated in the word "Gadi".

The second "Gadi" is to go to the Jiaxingdao quickly.

Including Shravaka, Enlightenment, Bodhisattva's respective warm, enduring, forbearance, and the world's first Dharma and practice, and the completeness of Tantra's supreme yoga, the language, the mind, and the illusory body are also condensed into this "Gadi".

"Baranga Di" means "go to the other side quickly".

The other side here refers to the Way of Seeing, including the Way of Seeing of Shravaka, Enlightenment, and Bodhisattva.

The way of seeing is divided into the way of seeing the uninterrupted, the way of liberation, and the way of seeing the latter.

The unaffected illusory body and light of the Supreme Yoga Tantra are also condensed into these four words.

From the moment of seeing the Dharma, the present realized emptiness and correctly understood the reality of all things in the world.

"Baran Sengadi" means "go to the other shore quickly".

The other shore here refers to the way of cultivation, including the cultivation ways of Shravaka, Enlightenment, and Bodhisattva.

Cultivation of the Dao is divided into the incessant cultivation of the Dao, the cultivation of the Dao of liberation, and the cultivation of the Dao after attaining the Dao.

The enlightenment and learning of the Supreme Yoga Tantra are also condensed into these five words.

The vajra metaphor of the Bodhisattva cultivating the path can completely remove the obstacles of innate affliction and knowledge, so "Bharam Sengadi" also means "going to the other shore most accurately".

"Bodi", Bodi is Bodhi, that is, no cultivation way.

Including Shravaka, Enlightenment, Mahayana's non-cultivating way, as well as Buddha's ten powers, four fearless, twenty-one non-leakage Dharma, Tantra's physical and mental dual transport and other Buddha's merits are all condensed into these two words. Including the merits of Shravaka and Arhats.

"Soha", which means the basis, according to the "Heart Sutra" study, all the merits mentioned above will be perfect.

If you interpret every word of the Heart Sutra mantra according to the Sanskrit meaning, the meaning of the mantra is inexhaustible, too deep and too broad.

This mantra perfectly describes the five realms of Mahayana, the five realms of sravaka, and the five realms of predestination. It describes the entire 84,000 Dharma doors, so it is not translated.

The translation can't be finished, the meaning inside can't be fully expressed in language, and it's not a spell when it's translated.

Because the mantra of the Heart Sutra is so special, many practitioners in Tibet often recite this mantra.

There was a living Buddha, and one of his disciples said to him: Master, I am so diligent now that I can read the Diamond Sutra more than 20 times a day.

The Living Buddha said, are you diligent? I am better than you.

The disciple asked, how many sutras does Master read a day?

The living Buddha said, guess what.

The disciple said, can you read the Great Prajna Sutra once a day?

The Living Buddha said, this is not difficult, it is a matter of a sudden.

The disciple thought it was amazing, so he asked, how do you read it?

The Living Buddha said, listen to me read: "Dayata Omga Diga

Tipalangati Baransengadi Potisoha" and finished reading it in one fell swoop.

Therefore, for those who really understand the mantra, the merits of reciting the mantra once are the same as reading the Mahaprajna Sutra once.

The mantras in the Heart Sutra have many other magical uses.

For example, in Tibet, in order to break the disaster of earth, water, fire and wind, and to exorcise demons, obstacles, and diseases, the White Stone Mantra is used.

The method is to prepare 100,000 small white stones first, and then recite "Dayata Om Gadi Gadi Barangati Baran Sen Gadi Potisoha" every time you take a small stone

Once, then blow on the small stone, and repeat this a hundred thousand times.

Then put this pile of small white stones in a disaster-prone place, it will have a very magical effect.

The third section is not translated, etc.
In Buddhist scriptures, some are not translated.

This is because Sanskrit has a strong expressive power, and the content of the expression is very deep and wide. Other languages ​​cannot express the original meaning of Sanskrit, and sometimes there is no way to translate it.

For example, "Nanwu" is a literal translation from Sanskrit. If it is translated, it means bowing, making offerings, and taking refuge.

The translation is "promise, make offerings, take refuge in a certain Buddha...", which is too long, just use "Nanwu" directly.

Mantras are not translated.

The translation is not a spell, nor can it fully express the full meaning of the spell.

The names of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas are not translated.

"Sakyamuni" is a literal translation of Sanskrit. If it is translated into Chinese, it means "Nengren". If you say "Nengren Buddha", many people will not understand it and say "Shakyamuni Buddha"

People all over the world understand it, so I don't translate it.

"Amitabha" means immeasurable light and immeasurable life. If it is translated as "immeasurable light", it will lack "immeasurable life".

How does Ngawang Gyatso translate? Ngawang's translation is the freedom of speech, Gyatso is the law of the sea, and Ngawang Gyatso is the sea of ​​the law of freedom of speech.

If you say "I am looking for Master Yu Zizai Fahai", no one will know, but Master Ngawang everyone knows.

Place names are not translated.

The Varanas I mentioned earlier, Varanas is Varanas, and everyone knows where "Vanaras" is, but I don't understand it when I translate it.

Master Xuanzang of the Tang Dynasty summed up the "four cases and five no translations" based on the experience of the predecessors, which was regarded as the principle of translation by later generations to follow and refer to.

Chapter Fourteen

After reciting the mantra, there is a compliment at the back of the Tibetan version of the Heart Sutra:

"Sariputta Bodhisattva Mahasattva should practice the profound and wonderful Prajna-Paramita in this way, so the Bhagavan told Holy Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva Mahasattva from Samadhi to say good, good, good, good man. All the Tathagatas also rejoiced in the Bhagavad’s words, the life-span and the relics, the Holy Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva, Mahasattva, and all the retinues of the gods, the gods, the gods, the Gandharvas, and all the worlds rejoiced and proclaimed the Buddha’s decree.”

Completion of praise is the eulogy after the end of the line. At this time, Buddha Shakyamuni came out and said to Guanyin Bodhisattva: Good, good, good, Guanyin Bodhisattva and Shariputra, what you said is what the Buddha meant. If the Buddha himself said it, he said it. Just like you, your question and answer to the Heart Sutra is very correct, and that is what the Buddha meant.

The Buddha thus praised Guanyin Bodhisattva and relics.

The family members who listen to the "Heart Sutra" include Bodhisattvas, Shravakas, monks, nuns, laypeople, as well as yaksas, non-humans, gods, asuras, and Gandharvas.

These family members praised the Buddha together, praised Guanyin Bodhisattva and relics.

Believers who listen to the Heart Sutra do not have predestined enlightenment, and predestined enlightenment does not appear in the retinue of the Buddha.

People of the predestined caste are relatively proud. From the very beginning of their practice, they have vowed to become Buddhas by themselves, without relying on other Buddhas. Because of the power of this vow, the Buddha Dharma is extinguished, and they appear. Therefore, there is no predestined enlightenment among the Buddha's retinue.

The "Heart Sutra" translated by Master Xuanzang has only 260 words. There is no preface and no compliments, but the main content is there. The merits of reciting this version of the "Heart Sutra" are the same as those of other versions.

Chapter 15 The Meditation Method of the Heart Sutra
Three victories in the first quarter
The Patriarchs of the Kadam School paid great attention to three points when they practiced: initiation, practice, and dedication.

These three points are called three special victories, which contain a lot of content. We will briefly talk about them now.

After getting up every day, the first thing is to make a heart. It is conceivable how important it is.

In the process of actual cultivation, visualization is very important. In real cultivation, if you don’t visualize at all, just recite sutras with your mouth, and your mind is very scattered, then cultivation will not have much effect.

Dedication is very important after the devotion practice is over.

If you recite the scriptures today and don’t dedicate yourself at night, when you get angry, the blessings will be gone, and the blessings will not disappear after devotion.

The second section of the Heart Sutra
There are two methods of meditation when reciting the Heart Sutra.

1. Method 1
Visualize on the top of your head, Sakyamuni Buddha sitting on a lotus throne, entering samadhi, with both hands forming the Dharma Seal, the left hand is down, the right hand is up, and the thumbs of both hands are intertwined.

On the right of Shakyamuni is Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva, and on the left is the relic.

Visualize the body of Sakyamuni emitting bright and soft light of eighteen colors, welcoming the bodhisattvas and sentient beings of the six realms from the Pure Land of Buddhas and Tathagatas, and sitting around the Buddha, Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva and Sariputra.

Visualize Shakyamuni Buddha entering a very deep and wonderful meditation, blessing Guanyin Bodhisattva and Sariputra.

When reciting "Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva's deeds are deep in prajna-paramita, he sees that the five aggregates are all emptiness and saves all misery", and visualizes Guanyin Bodhisattva contemplating emptiness, and seeing that the five aggregates have no self-nature, then, Shariputra asked Guanyin Bodhisattva, are the five aggregates empty? Are all dharmas empty? Chanting while thinking.

"The form of the relic is not different from the emptiness and the emptiness is not different from the form. The form is the emptiness and the form." Visualize the Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva in reply saying that the Potegala people have no self, and the "self" that is established on the five aggregates does not exist.

First of all, think about the aggregate of form, the self in the form does not exist, and at the same time tell yourself in your heart that the body is not me, it is wrong to think that the body is me, and so on.

"The same is true for feeling, thinking, and action consciousness." Continuing to think, it is not me who feels pain and happiness, it is not me who can think, neither is me, nor is my six senses.

The self established on the five aggregates does not exist.

"Sariputra is the emptiness of all dharmas" Here we say "dharma has no self", not only human beings have no self-nature, but all things and all dharmas also have no self-nature.

If the existence of a cup cannot be established, whether it is on the lid, the bottom of the cup, the body of the cup, or a certain part inside or outside the cup, these concepts of establishment are all wrong. The concept of Anritsu on the cup is also wrong. Only the existence of the famous saying is the real Anritsu.

For another example, each part of a microphone is not it, is it the whole? The whole is its aggregate, whatever is settled on the aggregate is not, it is all wrong, this is the emptiness of all dharmas.

In the wisdom of emptiness, the myriad dharmas and myriad things settled on the aggregates do not exist, but it does not mean that the myriad dharmas and myriad things do not exist, it means that the myriad dharmas and myriad things that we imagined do not exist.

"Not born, not destroyed, not defiled, not pure, not increased nor decreased" Thinking about people and dharmas has no self-nature.

"That's why the sky has no form, no feelings, thoughts, actions, consciousness, no eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, mind, color, body, fragrance, touch, and Dharma." I thought in my heart: This is about the Mahayana cultivation path, and cultivation of the path is cultivation of emptiness. Cultivating the Dao, at this time, you will realize that the form, body, smell, touch, and dharma have no self-nature.

In the samadhi of emptiness, there is no play on the mundane truth.

"The realm of vision and even the realm of unconsciousness has no ignorance and no end of ignorance, and there is no end to old age and death." What we are talking about here is that the eighteen realms and the twelve dependent origins are all without self-nature.

"The Way of No Suffering, Accomplishment and Extermination" is about the Four Noble Truths. The Four Noble Noble Truths are all empty in nature. Humans and Dharmas are also empty in nature, and they all have no self-nature.

"There is no wisdom, no gain, no gain" is about the emptiness of no way.

"The reason why Bodhisattva relies on Prajna Paramita" is about Bodhisattva, and all three vehicles rely on the Prajna Sutra to become Buddha.

"There is no hindrance in the mind, no hindrance, so there is no fear, far from the upside-down dream and ultimate nirvana".

"Three generations of Buddhas rely on Prajnaparamita to obtain Anuttara-Samyaksabodhi." Reflecting on the merits of the Heart Sutra, cultivating the Heart Sutra can cut off afflictions, eliminate disasters and avoid calamities, and expel demons.

All the sages of the three vehicles achieve the fruition status according to Prajnaparamita.

All the Buddhas of the Three Worlds, the Tathagata, all attained Buddhahood according to Prajnaparamita.

"Therefore, knowing that Prajna Paramita is a great divine mantra, a great bright mantra, a supreme mantra, and an incomparable mantra, it can remove all suffering. It is true and true. Therefore, to say the Prajna Paramita mantra is to say the mantra: Dayata Om Gatti Gatti Paran Gardipa "Ransengadi Bodisoha" contemplates the practice of the five paths, namely, the path of sustenance, path of action, path of vision, path of cultivation, and path of non-learning contained in the mantra.

After reciting, visualize the white light from the bodies of Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva and Buddha Sakyamuni, transcending the six realms of beings who were sitting around, and then the Buddha came out of concentration and said to Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva, "Good, good, good. You are absolutely right. Such.

Then, Guanyin Bodhisattva and Shariputra merged into Shakyamuni Buddha, and Shakyamuni Buddha gradually became one inch in size. Visualize that there is a finger-thick, red central meridian in the middle of my body. Shakyamuni Buddha slowly moves along the central meridian. Slowly descend, your heart becomes an eight-petal lotus, the Buddha rests on the eight-petal lotus, and the lotus slowly closes, and the Buddha lives in your heart forever. This is called having a Buddha in your heart.

2. Method 2
This method is relatively simple.

The emptiness of the explicit meaning of the Heart Sutra is very profound. If you really cannot understand the explicit meaning, you must understand the hidden meaning. This method is mainly based on thinking about the hidden meaning of the Heart Sutra.

For example, when you recite "form is not different from emptiness and emptiness is not different from form and form, that is, emptiness, that is, form, feeling, thought, action, and consciousness are also like this", you should understand that this is talking about the bodhisattva's Path of Accumulation, and then think about the merits of the Path of Accumulation.

There are a lot of merits from the beginning of The Lesser Stage material path. The Intermediate Stage material path will get meditation, and if you follow the meditation, you will get the Dharma joy, and you can hear the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas speak the sutras, etc., and think about these merits more.

"It is the empty image of all dharmas" The implicit meaning is the way of adding practice, thinking about the merits of the four ways of adding practice.

"Not born, not destroyed, not defiled, not pure, not increased nor decreased" is about the way of seeing, thinking and Path of Seeing can cut off afflictions and other virtues.

"That's why the sky has no form, no feeling, thought, action, consciousness, no eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, mind, no color, sound, smell, touch, and dharma." It is about cultivating the Way, thinking about the merits of cultivating the Way to cut off the obstacles of innate afflictions and obstacles of knowledge.

"Ultimate Nirvana" is talking about the non-cultivation path, which is the fruition of a Buddha, becoming a Buddha, attaining all knowledge, attaining the four bodies, breaking all afflictions and obstacles to knowledge, and thinking more about these qualities of a Buddha.

The merit of reciting the Heart Sutra once is enormous.

When you do not realize emptiness, it is difficult to think about the explicit meaning, but you can think about the hidden meaning, slowly recite it, think slowly, and you can remember it.

If you recite the Heart Sutra once, if you can contemplate the hidden meaning, you will have great merit.

If a person can live for as many kalpas as the number of sands in the universe, and make offerings to the Buddhas and Tathagatas with the Seven Treasures every day, the blessings obtained are the same as those obtained by meditating on the hidden meaning of the Heart Sutra.

In the past, some masters used to think slowly and carefully when reciting the Heart Sutra. It took three days to recite the Heart Sutra once.

When we recite the Heart Sutra, we should do the same, think carefully, it doesn’t matter if you don’t finish reciting it in one day, and it’s okay to continue reciting it the next day.

For example, when reciting "the path of cessation of suffering without suffering", start thinking about suffering: think about the suffering of beings in the six realms.

Set, think about afflictions, think about how many afflictions you have, how many afflictions others have, think about the types of afflictions, do you have this kind of afflictions, do you have that kind of afflictions, if there are, you should suppress those that can be suppressed , I will cut off what can be cut off. If the afflictions cannot be suppressed and cannot be cut off, I will make a vow and ask the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas to bless me to cut off these afflictions.

Continue to think about, to eliminate, to think about the liberation after the elimination of afflictions, the liberation after the elimination of knowledge obstacles, how much merit there is.

Continue to think, the way, the three vehicles, the way of sustenance, the way of additional practice, the way of seeing, and the way of cultivation, must be carefully thought about.

In this way, slowly recite, think slowly, and form the habit of thinking, and wisdom will gradually open up.

At this time, when you recite "Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva's deeds are deep in prajnaparamita, he sees that the five aggregates are empty...", and then you can remember them all.

Sometimes, you can only want the explicit meaning and don’t want to recite the implicit meaning; or you can think about the implicit meaning and the five ways, and exchange your thoughts until you can remember the explicit meaning and the implicit meaning, and then recite and think together.

When you don’t have time, you can skip the scriptures, just recite the mantra, and think about the meaning of the mantra as you recite it.

"Dayata Om Gadi Gadi Baranga Di Baran Sen Gadi Potisoha", "Gadi", is to go to the material road; "Gadi", quickly go to the road of Jiaxing; "Emperor", hurry up to see the Dharma; "Bharam Sengadi", hurry up to cultivate the Dharma; "Bodi", hurry up and do not cultivate the Dharma.

Thinking about the five ways of Mahayana in this way, but also to understand the content contained in it, realize that the merit will be very great.

The explicit and implicit content of the Heart Sutra has been briefly discussed, and more detailed content will be discussed later.

Chapter 16 The Secret Meaning of the Heart Sutra
The esoteric meaning of "Heart Sutra" includes the esoteric method of emptiness and happiness. It was taught by auspicious lions, a great achiever in ancient India. We will briefly introduce the esoteric meaning and content of the "Heart Sutra".

The esoteric meaning of the "Heart Sutra" holds that the place where the "Heart Sutra" is preached is Ling Vulture Mountain.

The Shakyamuni Buddha who preached the "Heart Sutra" is the extraordinary incarnation of Shakyamuni's bhikkhu appearance on the outside, the Vajra Master on the inside, and the esoteric wisdom.

The Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva who taught the "Heart Sutra" on behalf of Shakyamuni Buddha is a Bodhisattva Avalokitesvara on the outside, the Great Compassionate Avalokitesvara on the inside, and the secret is the Great Compassion Store of the Buddhas and Tathagatas.

The four groups of disciples who listened to the sutra included 2,500 great bhikkhus and 77,000 bodhisattvas outside, and inside were the retinues of the deity and the Sambhogakaya.

Prajna is divided into Cause Prajna, Dao Prajna, and Fruit Prajna.

Because Prajna is natural wisdom, Dao Prajna has learned the Dao, and Fruit Prajna is not cultivated.

The Dharma door contained in the Heart Sutra is the Dharma door of Theravada Buddhism, the Dharma door of the Mahayana Sutra in the inner, and the Dharma door of the Mahayana Tantra in the secret.

The Five Aggregates of Form, Feeling, Thinking, Action, and Consciousness mentioned in the Heart Sutra, the secret meaning is the Buddha of the Five Directions.

The basic five aggregates can become Buddhas of the five directions through practice.

The five aggregates are also the five great diamonds.

The form aggregate is the body diamond, the feeling aggregate is the void diamond, the thinking aggregate is the speech diamond, the action aggregate is the karma diamond, and the consciousness aggregate is the mind diamond.

When you become a Buddha, the five aggregates will become the five great vajras.

The secret meaning of the aggregate of consciousness also includes the five wisdoms.

Great Circle Mirror Wisdom, Equality Wisdom, Wonderful Observation Wisdom, Completion Wisdom, and Dharma Realm Wisdom.

The Heart Sutra is about emptiness in the explicit meaning, the order of the Dharma in the hidden meaning, and great happiness in the secret meaning.

The explicit meaning of the Heart Sutra only talks about emptiness, not the wisdom to realize emptiness.

The hidden meaning speaks of the wisdom of realizing emptiness.

The Esoteric also speaks of the wisdom of realizing emptiness.

The wisdom in the hidden meaning is different from the wisdom in the esoteric meaning. The wisdom in the esoteric meaning is four kinds of great bliss: bliss, supreme bliss, extraordinary bliss, and life-giving bliss. The esoteric method believes that the power of bliss can realize emptiness.

The secret meaning of the six faculties is the six Buddhas, the eyes are the Tathagata of Earth Store King, the ears are the Tathagata of the Vajra Hand, the nose is the Tathagata of the Void Store, the tongue is the Tathagata of Avalokitesvara, the body is the Tathagata Removing Obstacles, and the mind is the Tathagata of Wonderful Sound.

The six faculties and the corresponding cultivation methods of the Six Tathagatas are explained in great detail in Tantra.

The secret meaning of the six realms.

The form is the vajra of the form, the sound is the vajra of the sound, the aroma is the vajra of the fragrance, the taste is the vajra of the taste, the touch is the vajra of the touch, and the dharma is the vajra of the dharma.

The explicit meaning of the Heart Sutra speaks of sixteen emptinesses.

The esoteric teachings describe the sixteen great blisses of the sixteen emptiness realizations.

The combination of explicit meaning and esoteric meaning is the only method of emptiness and happiness.

The ignorance taught by the esoteric method of ignorance is that ordinary greed is an obstacle to affliction, and ordinary appearance is an obstacle to knowledge.

Death Tantra believes that when a person dies, the five major elements of earth, water, fire, wind, and emptiness are integrated into the central channel. After they are integrated, the four elements of brightness, increase, gain, and death appear empty. Then it emerges from the light of death to attain emptiness, then from the attained sky to the augmented space, and when it emerges from the augmented space to the light, the human soul enters the bardo body.

The secret meaning of Jiji is the fine karmic energy. In the esoteric method, it is said that delusional thoughts will follow the karmic energy. When the five qi is integrated into the central channel, the root of delusional thoughts will be cut off.

Extinction is liberation; when afflictions are extinguished, liberation is attained; when obscurations of knowledge are cut off, great liberation is obtained.

To break the subtle obstacles of knowledge, one must practice the tantra of the Supreme Yoga Department.

The Bodhisattva of the Xian sect must reach the position of the Bodhisattva in the tenth level at the latest, and he must also cultivate the esoteric method in order to break the subtle obstacles of knowledge.

The true realization of the truth of extinction depends on the esoteric method of the supreme yoga department, because how to eliminate the subtle obstacles of knowledge, how to integrate the habit into the indestructible light point, how to give birth to the light body of consciousness in the indestructible light point, etc., only the tantra can Speak clearly.

The esoteric meaning of Daodao is the second and second order of esoteric Buddhism.

The Bodhisattva mentioned in the Bodhisattva Xianzong includes the eight great bodhisattvas, and the Bodhisattva mentioned in the Tantric Buddhism is the warrior, the brave mother, the dakini, and the dakini.

According to the Tantric Method of Hanging Obstacles, in addition to the obstacles mentioned in the sutras, there are also twenty-five kinds of rough points, eighty self-natures, and their wind cavalry.

The esoteric method of terror believes that in addition to the horrors taught by the sutras, there are also six indeterminate pains in the bardo body, four terrible sounds, and three indeterminate hanging borders.

Ultimate nirvana is the ultimate nirvana without the cultivation of the path and both body and mind. Only the esoteric method can explain the ultimate nirvana very clearly.

The buddhas taught by the three generations of the buddhas include thousands of Buddhas of sages and eons, and the esoteric sects talk about the four deities.

**Anuttarasamyaksabodhi** 

The secret meaning of Anuttarasamyaksabodhi is the seven branches of harmony, and the seven branches of harmony are perfection, harmony, great bliss, no self-nature, great compassion, benefiting life without interruption, and eternal abiding.

The following parts are only available in the Tibetan version of the Heart Sutra.

Prajna Paramita Mantra 

Prajna Paramita Mantra refers to the tantra's Path of Accumulation.

The Daming Mantra is the esoteric way of esoteric Buddhism.

The supreme mantra is the way of seeing in tantra.

The Mantra of No Equals is the practice of Tantra.

Removing all suffering mantras is the esoteric path of non-cultivation.

Another explanation is that the Prajna Paramita mantra is like the great wisdom of the Buddha, which can act without hindrance; the great bright mantra is like the light that removes darkness, which can remove all obstacles and make all living beings wish for it; the supreme mantra is the manifestation of the wisdom of the Buddha The mantra is the most supreme mantra in the world; the Mantra of No Equals, "No Equal" is Buddha, "Equal" is to make ordinary people equal to Buddhas, and it is the mantra that can make ordinary people become Buddhas; the mantra of eliminating all suffering is a mantra that removes all suffering.

The secret meaning of Dayata Om Gadi Palangati Palang Sen Gadi Potisoha Dayatayata is "there is nothing else, so it is...".

Om Miyi is the five poisonous afflictions during reincarnation, and can be transformed into the deity of the five directions through practice.

Gadi Miyi is the wisdom body of self-interest.

Gadi Miyi is altruistic, samsara and incarnation.

The secret meaning of Balangati is the complete realization of emptiness.

The secret meaning of Bharatsengadi is the complete realization of the mundane truth.

Bodhi Miyi is the great Bodhi.

The meaning of Suohami is to wish all sentient beings to be liberated and to wish for their wishes.

There are very few works in the Buddhist community that introduce the tantric method in the Heart Sutra. In the Tibetan Tripitaka of Ganzhuer, there are ten annotations on the Heart Sutra, and only one of the tantric meanings.

I have received the transmission of the Heart Sutra from many masters, and I have made a brief introduction to the Heart Sutra with reference to ten ancient Indian annotations on the Heart Sutra and forty annotations of the great siddhas of Tibetan Buddhism. "Contains the secret meaning.

So far, this should be a relatively complete book about the secret meanings in the Heart Sutra.

However, according to the stipulations of the tantra, the esoteric method cannot be taught to those who have not received empowerment. Therefore, the tantric meaning of the Heart Sutra cannot be explained in detail.

To learn Tantra, you must first learn the Dharma door of Sutra, because Sutra is the foundation of Tantra.

Many of the teachings of Buddhism are not clearly explained in the sutras, but in the esoteric sects, they are very thorough and complete.

Therefore, after learning and cultivating the Dharma of Xianzong, one must learn and cultivate the Dharma of Tantra in order to achieve Consummation.

May everyone realize emptiness and achieve great Bodhi as soon as possible.

Good luck!

**2. The Heart Sutra of Prajnaparamita, the Universal Wisdom Store**

Retranslation by Tang Mojiti of Sanzang Shaman Fayue (AD 738)

So I heard that at one time the Buddha was in the Vulture Mountain in the great city of Wangshe with a large bhikkhu crowd of hundreds of thousands of Bodhisattvas and Mahasattvas, all of whom were named Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva Manjushri Bodhisattva Maitreya Bodhisattva, etc., and thought that all the above-mentioned leaders had obtained the samadhi. When I lived in unimaginable liberation, Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva Mahasattva sat in the midst of the crowd, got up from the seat, went to the World-Honored One, put his palms together, bowed and bowed respectfully, and said to the Buddha that the World-Honored One wanted to say that all Bodhisattvas are universal in this meeting. Wisdom Treasure Prajna Paramita only wishes the World Honored One to listen to what I said and declare the secret Dharma for all the Bodhisattvas. At that time, the World Honored One will tell Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva Mahasattva with the wonderful Brahma voice. The one with great compassion will listen to what you have said and make great light with all sentient beings. Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva Mahasattva listened to the Buddha's protection and thought, entered into the wisdom light samadhi, entered into this concentration, and practiced deep prajna paramita with samadhi. When I saw that the natural nature of the five aggregates was empty, I knew that the natural nature of the five aggregates was empty. Follow that samadhi. When I wake up in peace, I tell Wisdom Shariputra that good man Bodhisattva has Prajna Paramita, the heart is called Universal Wisdom, you listen carefully to the good thoughts, and I should explain and write these words for you. The wisdom has given Shariputra to White Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva Mahasattva. Only the Great Pure Ones wish to say that now is the time to tell Shariputra that all Bodhisattvas and Mahasattvas should study the nature of form and emptiness in this way. Empty and empty nature is that consciousness is not different from emptiness and emptiness is not different. Consciousness is emptiness and emptiness, that is, consciousness. Sariputra is the emptiness of all dharmas. It is not born, not destroyed, not dirty, not pure, not increased or decreased. Therefore, the sky is colorless, no feeling, thinking, action consciousness, no eyes, ears and nose. Tongue, body, mind, sound, smell, touch, dharma, no vision, even the unconscious world, no ignorance, no end of ignorance, no old age and death, no old age and death, no suffering, no settling, no path, no wisdom, no gain, no gain, so Bodhisattva relied on Prajnaparamita. There is no hindrance, no hindrance, so there is no fear, far from upside-down dreams, finally Nirvana III, all the Buddhas rely on Prajna Paramita, so they have attained Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi, so they know that Prajna Paramita is a great mantra It is true and true to be able to remove all suffering, so saying the Prajna Paramita mantra means saying the mantra.

Gakti Gakati Para Gakati Para Sangha Gakti Bodhi Shapoha

The Buddha said this has already been said by the monks and bodhisattvas, all the gods in the world, the Asura Gandharvas, and others who have heard the Buddha's words, all are very happy, believe it, accept it, and practice it.

**3. The Heart Sutra of Prajnaparamita**

Translation of the Sanzang, Prajna, Gongli Yan, etc., in the Tang Dynasty, Binguo (AD 790)

In this way, I heard that the Buddha at one time was with the great bhikkhus and Bodhisattvas in the mountain of Jajabhu in the city of Wangshe. At that time, the Buddha and the World-Honored One entered the samadhi. The name is vast and deep. The name of the Bodhisattva, Mahasattva, Avalokitesvara, Deep Prajna Paramita, and I saw the five. The aggregates are all empty and free from all sufferings, and the Shariputra immediately accepts the power of the Buddha and folds his palms to respect the White Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva Mahasattva. If a good man wants to learn the profound Prajna-Paramita, what is the practice? Gushou Relic

If the sariputra is a good man and a good woman, you should observe the five aggregates of emptiness when you practice deep prajna paramita. The form is not different from emptiness and emptiness, and the form is not different from form. Inexhaustible, impure, impure, neither increasing nor decreasing No suffering, no settling, no path, no wisdom, no gain, no gain, so the bodhisattva relied on Prajna Paramita, so there was no hindrance in the heart, no hindrance, so there was no fear, far from upside-down dreams, finally Nirvana III, all Buddhas depended on Prajna Paramita, so he attained Anuttara III Therefore, I know that Prajna Paramita is a great mantra, it is a great mantra, it is a supreme mantra, and it is an unparalleled mantra. It can remove all suffering. It is true and true. Therefore, when I say the Prajna Paramita mantra, I say the mantra.

Tiller Di Tiller Di Para, Tiller Di Para Sangha, Tiller Di Bodhi Sapo He

Thus, Shariputra, the Bodhisattvas and Mahasattvas in the deep prajna-paramita, should behave like this, and said this, the World-Honored One rose from the vast and deep samadhi and praised Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva Mahasattva. Deep Prajna Paramita should practice like this. When all the Tathagatas will rejoice when the World-Honored One speaks these words, Sariputra will be filled with great joy, and Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva and Mahasattva will be overjoyed. Wait

Hearing what the Buddha said, everyone rejoiced, believed, accepted and practiced

**4. The Heart Sutra of Prajnaparamita**

Translated by imperial edict of Sanzang Shaman Wisdom Wheel of Daxingshan Temple in Shangdu of Tang Dynasty (847-859 AD)

In this way, I heard that the Brahma Brahma was living in the Jiufeng Mountain of Wangshe City with the Great Bijian and the Great Bodhisattva. When the World-Honored One entered the place of Samadhi, the name was vast and deep, and I saw that there was a Bodhisattva Mahasattva named Avalokitesvara and Prajna Paramita. When you walk, you will see that the five aggregates are all empty, and you will have a long life. The relic of the Buddha, the mighty god, put his palms together and respect the White Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva Mahasattva. The Bodhisattva Mahasattva told Gushou Sariputta that if there is a good man or a woman who practices deep prajna paramita, he should see the five aggregates and their own nature are all empty and free from all suffering. It is not different from form, it is emptiness, it is emptiness, it is form, perception, perception, consciousness, and so on. Sariputra is the nature of all dharmas. Ear, nose, tongue, body, mind, colorless, sound, scent, touch, law, vision, and even

There is no ignorance in the unconscious world, no end of ignorance, no old age, no death, no suffering, no accumulation, no wisdom, no realization, no gain, no gain, so the Bodhisattva is reliant on Prajna Paramita, there is no obstacle in the mind, so there is no terror, far from upside-down dreams, and finally peace The Buddhas of the three worlds have relied on Prajna Paramita, so they have attained Anuttarasamyaksabodhi and now they are fully enlightened, so they know that Prajna Paramita is the great truth, the great enlightenment truth, the unsurpassed truth, and the inexhaustible truth. The truth is the truth

Emperor Ompi

Thus, Shariputra, all the Bodhisattvas and Mahasattvas in the deep prajna-paramita practice should be thus learned. Then the World-Honored One rose from the peace of Samadhi and praised Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva Mahasattva. Paramita should walk in this way, when all Tathagatas walk in this way, all the Tathagatas will rejoice. At that time, the World Honored One said that he has already had a long life, the relic of the Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva, and all the gods and people in the world, such as Asura Pang Chi, who heard what the Buddha said, they all rejoiced in believing, accepting and practicing what the Buddha said.

**5. The Heart Sutra of Prajna Paramita (Dunhuang Cave Version)**　

Tang Sanzang Master Sramana Facheng translation (AD 856)

Thus, I heard that Bhagavan was living in the Vulture Peak Mountain of Wangshe City at one time, and the World-Honored One entered into a deep understanding of the different doors of the Samadhi Dharma, and then the Bodhisattva and Mahasattva of Avalokitesvara entered the deep world. When you observe the prajna paramita, you can see that the properties of the five aggregates are all in space, time, and life. The sari son inherits the power of the Buddha. The white sage, Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva Mahasattva, said that if a good man wants to practice deep prajna paramita, he should say this by practicing and studying. The Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva Mahasattva replied that if a good man and a good woman want to practice deep prajna paramita, they should observe the five aggregates in this way. Consciousness is also empty. Therefore, all dharmas of Sariputra have no form, no birth, no extinction, no smear, no reduction, no increase. Sariputra, therefore, in the nature of time and space, there is no color, no feeling, no thinking, no action, no consciousness, no eyes. No ears, no nose, no tongue, no body, no inclination, no color, no sound, no smell, no taste, no touch, no vision, no consciousness, no ignorance, no end of ignorance, no old age, no death, no end of suffering, no accumulation, no path, no wisdom, no gain, no end That's why the Sariputra depended on the bodhisattvas because they had nothing to gain.

Prajna Paramita has no obstacles in the mind, no terror, more than upside-down, ultimate Nirvana, all Buddhas in the third world also rely on Prajna Paramita, so they have attained the unsurpassed and perfect Bodhi Shariputra. Therefore, you should know that the great secret mantra of Prajna Paramita is the great mantra and the supreme mantra. The no-wait mantra is the mantra that can remove all kinds of suffering. Therefore, we know that Prajna Paramita is a secret mantra. That is to say, the Prajna Paramita mantra is said.

Edi Edi Bo La Edi Bo La Monk Edi Bodhi Shaho

Shariputra Bodhisattva Mahasattva should be like this, and he should study very deeply in Prajna-Paramita. The World-Honored One, from that time, told the sage Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva Mahasattva, saying, "Good, good, good man. This is how you say." Also when I rejoice, Bhagavan said that the words have already passed the life-span of the Sariputra, Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva Mahasattva, all the gods in the world, Asura Gandharva, and others who heard what the Buddha said, they all rejoiced in believing, accepting and practicing them.

**6. "Buddha Speaks Holy Buddha's Mother Prajnaparamita Sutra"**

Song Xitian's translation of the scriptures by Sanzang Shihu Feng Zhao (980 AD)

So I heard that the World-Honored One was meeting with you in Jiufeng Mountain in the city of Rajashere.

A large crowd of 1,250 people, together with all the Bodhisattvas and Mahasattvas, surrounded the World-Honored One who entered the deep light and preached the true Dharma Samadhi. When Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva Mahasattva was in the Buddhist assembly, this Bodhisattva was Mahasattva. Hasattva has been able to practice deep prajna-paramita and see that the five aggregates are empty of their own nature. At that time, the venerable Shariputra inherited the power of Buddha and God. Before the white Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva Mahasattva said that if a good man and a good woman are here, the prajna-paramita method is very happy. Those who want to practice should think about what time to learn Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva Mahasattva told the Venerable Shariputra that you will listen carefully and declare to you that if good men and good women are happy to practice this profound prajnaparamita method, you should observe that the five aggregates are empty of their own nature. What is the self-nature emptiness of the five aggregates? Yes, form is emptiness, emptiness is form, form is no different from emptiness, no different from form, perception, thought, action, consciousness, and the same is true of Sariputra. Purity, no growth, no damage, loss of relics, so the sky has no color, no feelings, thoughts, actions, consciousness, no eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body and mind, no color, sound, scent, touch, dharma, no eyes, no eyes, no consciousness, even the unconscious, no consciousness, no ignorance, no end of ignorance, and no old age and death. No old age, no death, no suffering, no settling, no path, no wisdom, no gain, no gain, no gain, no gain, so the Bodhisattva, Mahasattva, and Prajna Paramita behave accordingly, so there is nothing in the mind and no hindrance, and there is no attachment and no obstacle, so there is nothing Fear away from all inversions and delusions, and finally pass away. All the Buddhas of the three times have attained Anuttara-Samyaksambodhi according to this Prajna-Paramita. Therefore, they should know that Prajna-Paramita is a vast enlightenment, an unsurpassed enlightenment, an unparalleled enlightenment, and it can exterminate everything. Suffering is the truth and no falsehood. All practitioners of the Dharma should study this way. I am now proclaiming Prajna Paramita.

If the Bodhisattva and Mahasattva can recite the prajnaparamita, then the world-honored one will follow the third prajnaparamita. Mahasattva rose up peacefully and praised Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva Mahasattva saying goodness, goodness, good man, as you said, this is the case, Prajna Paramita, this is the way to learn it, that is, the truth, the ultimate, all the Tathagatas, and the Buddha said this sutra. Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva Mahasattva And all the people in the world, including the gods and the gods, the Asura Gandharva, and all the people who heard the Buddha's words, all rejoiced, believed, accepted and practiced them.

**7. "Bhagavan's Wisdom to the Other Shore Heart Sutra"**

Tibetan Version of the Heart Sutra

So I heard that Bhagavan was at the Vulture Mountain in the city of Rajasha and was meeting with the great bhikkhus and the great Bodhisattvas. When Bhagavan entered the samadhi of the deep understanding of the Dharma, at that time, there was another holy Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva Mahasattva contemplating the prajna wave.

Ramita's profound and wonderful deeds see that the five aggregates are all empty of their own nature, so they have a lifespan, and they have the power of the relics to inherit the Buddha's power. The White Saint Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva Mahasattva said good men and good women.
