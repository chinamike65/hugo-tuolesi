**Chapter 2 - Training for Individuals at the Middle Level**

In the The Three Principal Aspects of the Path - Training for Individuals at the Initial Level, the goal is not to fall into the three evil realms in the future, and to obtain the fruits of a human life and or heavenly realms.

However, even if a person obtains the fruit of a human life and or heavenly realms in the next life, it is not guaranteed that it will be the same for life after life.

After the accumulated merit is exhausted, they will definitely fall into the evil realms, and even the Great Brahma King is no exception.

Moreover, even if the accumulated merit of each life is great, if you create even greater evil karma, when you are dying, the evil karma will appear, and you will still fall into the evil realms in future lives.

Thinking this way, even if later rebirths obtain the fruit of a human life and or heavenly realms, it will not be final liberation, and there is still the possibility of falling into the evil realms.

So, you will realize that you can only truly get rid of the dread of falling into the lower realms if you can escape the six paths of rebirth. This requires the Training for Individuals at the Middle Level (Middle Scope Path).

Because the goal pursued by the Middle Scope Path is leaving the cycle of the six realms of rebirth (samsara), getting out  is the Dharma door of liberation.

To be free from samsara, one must first generate, through practice, renunciation.

What is renunciation? With a clear understanding of the suffering of the six realms of rebirth, renunciation is the arousal of the strong desire to escape from the six realms.

If you can realize that no matter how good the surface of the six-path samsara looks, it is still a pit of fire, and if you truly experience the pain of the six-path samsara, you will be able to generate renunciation.

On the basis of renunciation, training in moral discipline, meditative concentration and wisdom, or the Dharma Door of the Four Noble Truths, or the Twelve Links of Dependent Origination, can all lead to liberation.

Buddha Shakyamuni turned the wheel of Dharma three times and gave eighty-four thousand teachings.

The first turning of the Wheel is the Dharma Door of the Four Noble Truths, including the Path of the Initial Level, and the Path of the Middle Level.

Among them, the goal pursued by the Path of the Middle Level is liberation from the six realms of rebirth (samsara). Here, there are two kinds of aspirants to liberation: Shravakas and Arhats.

Shravakas seek liberation through listening to others’ instruction,the Mahayana, but do not practice it themselves.

They follow the Hinayana, and finally obtain the fruit of Arhatship. This is the voice-hearer, the Shravaka.

The Predestined Jue Arhat, also called the Solitary Arhat, mainly trains in the Twelve Causal Links of Dependent Origination.

In the beginning, this kind of person followed a guru and practiced the Dharma together with the Sangha. When they practiced in this way, they accumulated a hundred kalpas of good fortune. At this time, he made a vow: If he is reborn in the next life, and if there is no Buddha Dharma, or he finds the Dharma but there is no guru, to seek enlightenment on his own.

Due to the power of this vow, the Solitary Arhat will appear in the era of annihilation of the Dharma.

4

For example, according to Buddhist scriptures, the Buddha Dharma of Shakyamuni will live for five thousand five hundred years.

5,500 years after the birth of Buddha Shakyamuni, there will be no Buddha Dharma, and it will take another 45,000,000,000 years before the birth of Maitreya Buddha and his teaching of  the Dharma.

These 45,000,000,000 years are the long period of eradication of the Dharma. At this time, there is the possibility that Solitary Arhats (pratyekabuddhas) will appear.

When they saw the bones of some dead people, they began to think: 

These are the bones of people after death, so where does death come from?

Death comes only after life, so where does life come from? 

It comes from birth, birth follows pregnancy, and the cause of pregnancy is a defiled consciousness, so what is the cause of this consciousness? 

The emaotions taint consciousness.
Where do the emotions come from? 

It is because of the afflictions of ignorance that deeds arise... 

Just like that, they gradually understand that the root of samsara is the affliction of ignorance.

They continue to think: 

What is the affliction of ignorance. At this time, due to the accumulated merit of hundreds of kalpas during the time of the flourishing of the Dharma. When you think of it like this, you will follow the vows of the previous life into emptiness, and then you will have realized the truth of emptiness.

Then, if you practice steadily, you will be liberated in one lifetime.

This type of Arhat is called an Arhat of Dependent Origination, an Arhat who has become enlightened because he has realized the Twelve Links of Dependent Origination.

Solitary Arhats have not only cut off their afflictions, but also cut off part of cognitive obstructions. 

Their level of enlightenment is higher than Shravaka Arhats. Therefore, their appearance has a little of the Buddha's thirty-two marks and eighty auspicious features. For example, they have a part of the topknot, which the Shravaka Arhats do not have.

5

The goal of the Path of the Middle Scope training is to be liberated. To be liberated is to have an enlightened mind, the realisation of Buddha-nature.

Everyone has Buddha-nature, not only humans. 

Even animals have Buddha-nature, and all sentient beings have Buddha-nature.

Regarding Buddha-nature, because of different views in Buddhist teachings, understandings are also different.

Mind-only schools believe that the mind is originally pure, but it is defiled by afflictions, and a pure mind without defilements is Buddha-nature. 

The Madhyamika school believes that the mind is inherently selfless, it is emptiness, and the mind with emptiness is Buddha-nature.

We can think however we want, but we must understand that everyone has a heart that yearns for liberation, that is, the mind of awareness.

How does an Arhat become liberated by practising the path of the middle scope? After birth, with this awakening mind, he began to practice.

First, training in the path of accumulation. The path of accumulation is the way of accumulating good merit.

Then enter the path of joining.

The path of joining, is to prepare for the real entry into emptiness. At this time, you can analyse and realize emptiness.

Quantitative enlightenment requires comparison and analogy to understand, and it is a state of vague understanding.

When you reach the path of seeing, it is possible to realize the truth of emptiness. The nature of reality is clear, and you can understand it very clearly. It is like looking at the Amara fruit in the palm of your hand. It is the true realization of emptiness.

After realizing the emptiness of reality, all defilements will be cut off.

Generally speaking, there are two kinds of afflictions: one type are the mental afflictions, which are the afflictions that we imagine; the other type are the innate afflictions, which are the afflictions that we bring over in the cycle of samsara without beginning.

6

When these two kinds of afflictions are completely cut off, the fruit of Arahantship will be obtained.

What does the mind feel like after the troubles are over? 

Usually, our soul, consciousness and wind-energy are indistinguishable, dwelling in the central channel.

Once the mental afflictions are eliminated, and when the cultivation reaches the level of liberation, the wind-energy becomes the light body of consciousness, and this consciousness becomes a wisdom consciousness that truly realizes emptiness, which is different from our current defiled consciousness.

At this time, the light of wisdom consciousness forms a very dignified body the size of an eight-year-old child with five sense organs in the central channel.

With the wisdom of a Bodhisattva above the eighth bhumi, the light body of consciousness can enter and exit the body freely.

Before Theravada Arhats pass away, the light body of wisdom consciousness cannot go in and out of the body freely, and it always stays in the central channel.

At this time, the central channel will not become larger, and the light body of wisdom consciousness will not become smaller. This is an incredible merit.

The body of an Arhat is like an hotel. Wisdom consciousness lives in the light body. When the body is old and can no longer be used, or the sentient beings to be saved have been saved, the Arhat will pass away.

Once passed away, the light body of wisdom consciousness emerges from the central channel, freed from the bondage of birth, aging, sickness, and death. At this time, the blight body of wisdom consciousness is eternal, and it will never die, grow old, get sick, freed from the round of rebirth, and truly liberated.

Regarding the process of liberation, the sutras only talk about cutting off afflictions, not how the light body of wisdom consciousness is formed.

7

After the physical body of an Arhat has passed away, if they want to further cultivate and become a Buddha, it will take a long, long time, even longer than for ordinary humans like us.

This is because an Arhat has no suffering, only happiness, but also precisely because there are no adverse conditions, the merit and bodhicitta required for becoming a Buddha are difficult to generate, so it takes a longer time.

Traing in the path of the middle scope can liberate us from rebirth, so the way of the middle scope is also called the path of liberation.

So, what exactly is the practice of the path of the middle scope? 

It is simply the Dharma Door of the Four Noble Truths of Suffering, Cause of Suffering, Cessation of Suufering, and the Eightfold Path.

##### Section 1 - The Truth of Suffering

After having practiced the path of the Initial Level, and having entered the path of the Middle Level, the first thing to do is to cultivate the mind of renunciation, to developing aversion to samsara.

Because of the dread of the suffering of the six realms, to renounce the six realms of samsara is renunciation.

If you are still addicted to the splendor and wealth of the world, you will not have the mind of ​​renunciation.

Only by realizing that the enjoyment of human beings and heavenly gods is impermanent, and on the basis of the concept of impermanence that arises, the happiness of human beings and heaven is illusory, and the true colors of glory and wealth will be understood, and then one will obtain renunciation.

After attaining renunciation, one enters the path of accumulation of Theravada.

When we were studying the lower realms, we already had the desire to renounce the suffering of the three evil realms.

However, the mind of renunciation of the six realms and samsara has not yet arisen. To obtain this kind of renunciation, one needs to understand the six realms of suffering, which requires a lot of thinking about the truth of suffering.

1. Knowing Suffering

Knowing that the greatest suffering among the six realms of suffering is the suffering of the three lower realms there is no one who wants to fall into the three lower realms.

However, what we need now is a mind that wants to be free of all six realms of samsara.

Therefore, it is also necessary to recognize the suffering of the humans, asuras, and heavenly gods among the six realms.

The sufferings of these three "higher" realms can be divided into five parts: the five sufferings, the eight sufferings, the three sufferings, the sufferings of the Asuras, and the sufferings of the gods.

(1) The Five Sufferings 

The five sufferings are the five categories of suffering, including the suffering of change and impermanence, constant suffering, the suffering of samsara, the suffering of karma that cannot be changed, the suffering of afflictions that cannot be resolved, the suffering of being without support at critical moments.

##### 1. Suffering of Change

Impermanence means that nothing in the world is eternal, it is impermanent, and it is changing all the time.

Fame, wealth and honour are impermanent, family status is impermanent, and personal relatio9nships are impermanent.

Everything is impermanent and nothing lasts forever.

Change is painful.

For example, happiness in life can change to pain in an instant;

You have a good job, but suddenly you lose it.

Good times are always short, and also bring pain.

There are six types of suffering of change:

10

##### (1) Relatives and enemies are changeable and bitter. 

On the one hand, they are still friends today, but with a few harsh words, they may become enemies tomorrow.

On the other hand, someone you have always thought of as an enemy may one day help you, and that kind of feeling is also quite uncomfortable.

We have all experienced these situations, and this is a kind of suffering.

Often, over a lifetime, there is no who will always be our friend. It will change.

--- 
to do

To become a person in a normal relationship, or even to become an adversary or an enemy, this is the change of kinship and hatred.

---

In addition, karma is incredible. Due to karma, relatives and friends in this life may also become enemies in the next life;

In this life, you love your parents dearly, but in the next life you may become enemies, or creditors.

In the past, there was a wealthy family in India, and both the husband and the wife died. A few years later, Shariputra, the most wise among the Buddha's disciples, passed by his house and saw their son eating fish with his son in his arms. A dog came to snatch the bones of the fish, and was driven away with a whip.

Shariputra had supernatural powers and saw the karma of the scene in front of him: the fish that was eaten was the father of this family, and because he often ate the fish in the pond behind the house, he was reborn as a fish. This time he was caught and eaten by his own son; 

11

The dog was the mother. Because she loved her previous family, she was reborn as a domestic dog. Now, she was whipped by her own son for grabbing fish to eat;

The child in their son's arms was an enemy had raped his son's wife. After he was killed, because he still coveted his wife, he was reborn as her child.

When Shariputra saw these circumstances, he recited a verse:

“He eats his father’s flesh and kicks his mother away,

The enemy he killed he dandles on his lap,

The wife is gnawing at her husband’s bones,

Samsara can be such a farce.”

The man’s father died and was reborn as a fish in the pool, the layman caught his father, the fish, killed it, and was now eating it. The layman’s mother was very attached to the house so she was reborn as the man’s dog. The man’s enemy had been killed for raping the man’s wife; and because the enemy was so attached to her, he was reborn as her son. While he ate his father’s flesh, the dog – his mother – ate the fish bones, and so was beaten by her son. His own little son, his enemy, was sitting on his knee.

When we think about this situation, we also feel that rebirth is really ridiculous, and painful.

This is the fickleness of relatives, friends and enemies. No relationship is eternal.

##### (2) Impermanence of Status and Honour

Status is changeable and impermanent. 

Even a noble like the Emperor Shi Tian Wang, after their merit is exhausted, must fall into the evil realms, and then gradually be reborn into a poor family with low fortune.

Status is also fickle.

The same is true for all of of humanity. Even if someone was a very noble person as a child, due the impermanence of the relationship, he will become a person with low status. This situation is often seen.

In addition, with each rebirth, status is also constantly changing.

12

The Letter to a Friend says:

>
>Indra, universally revered,
>
>Will fall again to earth through action’s force.
>
>And he who ruled the universe as king
>
>Will be a slave within samsara’s wheel.
>

What is the concept of the wheel-turning king in the world? There are four kinds of wheel-turning kings. 

The one who rules four continents is the golden wheel king, the one who rules three continents is the silver wheel king, the one who rules two continents is the bronze wheel king, and the one who rules one continent is the iron wheel king.

The world we live in is called Jambudvipa in the South, which is trapezoidal and blue, and there are also three other worlds: 

Purvavideha in the East, which is semi-circular and white in colour;

Aparagodaniya (Eng. 'Enjoyer of Cattle') in the West, which is circular and ruby red; 

Uttarakuru (Eng. 'Unpleasant Sound') in the North, which is square and green. 

These are the four larger continents in Buddhist scriptures, where human beings and other sentient beings live. Each of the four continents is flanked by two subcontinents, there are a total of eight subcontinents, which are also inhabited by human beings.

There are also many planets where non-human beings live, that is, the worlds where Yakshas and Asuras live. Together, these are one world ruled by the Golden Wheel King.

That is to say, if the accumulated merit is exhausted, even the Wheel-Turning King who rules the four continents of the world will become a slave-maid among slaves, that is, the lowest among slaves;

Even Indra, the most noble and most respected by the world, will also become an ordinary person.

These worldly gods are like this, and we ordinary people are even less likely to have exceptions.

13

##### (3) Rich and poor alike experience the suffering of change

We have all seen the situation where the rich become poor, and the poor suddenly become rich;

The rich become poor in an instant, this is the exchange of wealth and poverty.

For example, some rich people go to Macau to gamble and lose all of their money in one night. Not only do they become poor, but they also owe a lot of debt.

There are many more examples of big bosses who are already very rich, because of investment in stock trading, suddenly they are heavily in debt.

This situation is very common, which is the fickle nature of wealth and poverty.

Under normal circumstances, it is difficult to go from being poor to being rich, but it is very easy to go from rich to poor.

##### （4）Suffering the impermanence of happiness 

Happy times can't go on forever, and even if you find some happiness, you will soon lose it, and even turn into pain.

For example, people in the heavenly world will enjoy it very much when they are alive. Once the accumulated merit is exhausted, the appearance of decline will appear, and they will fall into hell in the next life.

This is suffering the impermanence of happiness.

##### （5）impermanence of youth  

14

In the age of youth, everyone is young, beautiful, and strong, but such time is short, which is also suffering.

From 20 to 30 years old, ten years is not a long time. When we look back at the age of 30, our youth has just passed. When we look at ourselves again, there are wrinkles on our face.

At the age of 80, the aging of the body is already obvious, and the old eyes are dim.

When you are about to die, looking back at this life is like having a dream, and it will pass in an instant. This is the fickle suffering of youth.

##### (6) The suffering of unreliable prosperity and wealth

The misery that wealth brings, is that it usually brings misfortune.

There is a story about two women, one is called the lucky girl, the other is called the unlucky old woman. Wherever the lucky girl went, the unlucky woman followed her like a shadow.

For example, when the lucky girl arrived at a certain person's home, she said, "I am a lucky girl, who will bring prosperity, fortune, and good luck to your career."

Everyone was very happy and said: "Come in and stay in my house." "

When the door was about to be closed, the ugly woman steps up and says, "Don't close the door, I'll come in too, she's a lucky girl, I'm an unlucky woman, and I'm inseparable from the lucky girl.

Lucky women are like wealth, and unlucky women are like disasters. If you have wealth, there will be disasters. When people have no blessings, wealth is a disaster.

Therefore, wealth without blessings is a disaster, and there is no fortune. If you have money, you will definitely get sick or have other problems.

15

In the past, there was a region in India where the throne was vacant. No matter who it was, whoever sat on the throne of the king, only lived for one day. Therefore, no one was willing to sit on that throne.

But there always has to be someone to run the country, so everyone had to take turns to sit on the throne, and whoever is on the throne will be unlucky.

Although he got the throne and the glory and great wealth, it was only for one day. It was very painful.

So, if you get great wealth and glory, then what are you using to pay for it? What you pay is good fortune, and all of a sudden, a lot of good fortune is eliminated.

We should often seriously think about these impermanent sufferings. If we understand that things are impermanent, we will not become so attached.

Let go of your attachment, and you will really have no worries.

Everything in the world is changing so fast, but we can't see it, and don't understand the truth.

For example, the high-rise buildings in front of us are changing and decaying every moment, but we don’t understand this. We have to wait until our wisdom grows before we realize the truth of impermanence, and then we will not be attached to anything.

##### 2. Suffering of samsara

16

The suffering of sentient beings from beginningless time is endless. We do not know how many times we have been in hell, how many times we have fallen into the realm of hungry ghosts, how much suffering we have gone through;

How many times have we gone to the realm of heaven, experienced short-lived happiness, and then fallen again once the accumulated merit was exhausted.

The suffering of the six realms of samsara is inexhaustible and endless.

It is still difficult to imagine the suffering of samsara. When we reach a certain level of practice and receive the merit of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas, it will be easier to imagine these sufferings.

So, we have been in endless misery in the six realms, most of the time in hell, with no chance of liberation.

Now, wehave the opportunity to learn Buddhism, and we must cherish this opportunity very much.

If you don’t cherish it, you will not be able to get free this time, and you will enter the cycle of rebirth again. If you want to find the Buddhadharma again, you may have to suffer countless kalpas in pain again.

##### 3. The Suffering of Unavoidable Karma

The suffering of unavoidable karma is the suffering of being unable to escape and change karma.
Unless karmic obstacles are eliminated, karma cannot be changed. Even if one has attained Arhatship, one still has to experience karmic retribution.

There are what are known as the "Four Fruits" on the Arhat path. 

The first fruit is called Srota apanna, the Stream-Enterer, but there are still some karmic obstructions.

There was a woman named Asangama, "Asanga", which means "blue sky" in Chinese. She attained the stage of a sotāpanna.

17

Someone set fire to her house. After the fire, she flew to the roof and used with her supernatural powers to see why someone had burned down her house.

It turned out that she had created some negative karma in her previous life, and had burned down the house of a Solitary Arhat. This karma had not been eliminated, so this was the resulting retribution.

Only after attaining the first fruit of Arhats will they be able to remember this karma and experience retribution.

She also thought that the karma she created would eventually be experienced by herself, so she jumped into the fire and burned to death.

Once the retribution is manifested, it is very difficult to change it. To force and change the retribution is only possible in Tantric Buddhism.

For example, cancer. Before you get cancer, you can eliminate the cause of cancer;

After you have cancer, the effect has already manifest, and it is very difficult to cure or eliminate it.

There is a banyan tree in India. The roots underground can grow to a radius of five hundred paces, and the branches near the ground can also grow to five hundred paces.

Such a big tree is very easy to dig up when it is still a small seed.

If you wait for it to grow into a big tree, and then want to pull it out, you need to dig out all the roots in a radius of 500 steps.

Therefore, in order to eliminate karma, it must be eliminated before the effect manifests, when it is a seed.

After the effect manifests, it will be very difficult to eliminate.

18

##### 4. The intractable suffering of the shackles of afflictions

Those suffering from the shackles of afflictions have many troubles, such as greed, hatred, ignorance, arrogance, doubt, and jealousy.
Even if you are aware of your own troubles, you also recognize that what hurts you are the troubles, but you can't stop them if you want to. This is also a kind of suffering.

##### 5. The suffering of being helpless at a critical moment

The suffering of being helpless at a critical moment is the suffering of being alone at a critical moment of life and death.
When sentient beings are dying, at this most critical moment, they are helpless. This is a very deep form of suffering.

The "Great Game Book" says:

---
TODO

All living beings come alone when they are born, 

and go alone when they die

Suffering its pain alone, never in the world of rebirth to rely on.

---

When we came into the world, we came alone, and when we leave, we also leave alone.


No one to rely on, no one to help us, one's own karma can only be borne by oneself, no one can share it, and we can only suffer alone.

These are the five sufferings.

19

### (2) The Eight Sufferings 

The Eight Sufferings are the suffering of birth, old age, illness, death, the suffering of separation from love, the suffering of resentment and hatred, the suffering of not being able to seek, and the suffering of the five aggregates.

##### 1. The suffering of birth 

A person is born in great suffering, and birth is the root of all suffering.
In the last three weeks of the fetus, the fetus already has a sense of smell, can smell a very bad smell, and will feel that the mother's womb is dirty, and always wants to leave. When you are born, you will feel very, very much pain, so babies will cry loudly as soon as they is born.

Nagarjuna Bodhisattva said in the "Letter to a Friend":

---
TODO

Then once there’s birth, comes misery untold,

And sickness, ageing, wants frustrated, death,

Decay, in short the whole great mass of pain.

If birth is stopped, all this will be no more.

---

Therefore, if there is life, there will be death, and there will be suffering.

All beings in the six realms have inexhaustible suffering.

##### 2. Suffering of Old-Age

20
We all know the suffering of old age.

The five sense organs of eyes, ears, nose, tongue, and body have all lost their original abilities.

The originally bright eyes became blurred and could not see anything;

The ears, often unable to hear;

The nose and tongue are very slow to sense odors, and they can't taste things when they eat;

The body moves slowly, or not at all;

Dark hair has turned white, the skin is wrinkled, and often disliked by others, causing great suffering.

Kadampa said:

that the body is slowly getting old,

but we don't knowit.

If you get old all of a sudden, no one can stand it. 

Just like a young man, whose hair turns white all of a sudden, you will definitely be unable tostand it, but as you get older, you will not notice the pain of old age.

Therefore, we must soberly realize that getting old is also a kind of suffering.

##### 3. Suffering of sickness

Everyone has felt the pain of sickness, great or small, is felt by everyone. All the inexhaustible pain.

It's not a big problem when you get a minor illness, but when you get a serious illness, you will have a lot of pain, and not just physical pain, but also in your mind, fear of death. This kind of psychological pain is extreme.

We all know examples of this.

Two people went to the hospital for physical examination. One of them had stomach cancer, and the other was healthy. However, the doctor mixed up the medical records, and said there was no problem with the person who had stomach cancer. However, the person without stomach cancer was told that he had stomach cancer and neede to be hospitalised for surgery.

Hearing what the doctor said, the stomach of the person who didn't have stomach cancer really started to hurt, and then he was hospitalized for more than 20 days, waiting for the experts from Beijing to perform the operation.

During this period, his health got worse and worse, and finally he couldn't get up, and he had to be supported by relatives when he went to the toilet.

When the expert arrived, the expert he saw that the symptoms did not look like gastric cancer, so he checked again and said that he did not have gastric cancer.

As soon as the man heard this, his body got better immediately, and there was no more disease.

So, even the name of a disease can frighten people to death. Many patients are frightened to death just by hearing it.

In addition, the man-made karma is serious now, and all kinds of strange and wierd diseases have appeared.

According to the records of Tibetan medicine, there were 424 types of diseases in humans, but now there are thousands of diseases.

There are many diseases that we have never seen or even heard of in Tibet. I have never seen anyone with dementia in Tibet.

Once, when I was teaching scriptures in Tibet, I mentioned this vegetative disease. Everyone was surprised and said, "This kind of disease still exists?" They all thought it was very strange. Many people had never heard of vegetative people.

Now there are many strange diseases, and these diseases will cause people to suffer.

##### 4. The Pain of Dying
 
At the moment of death, the four elements of the body are separated, and one's own body and consciousness are also separated, which is a very great suffering.

First comes the separation of the four major elements. Earth, water, fire, and wind are slowly pulled away. This process will be very painful for one's own body.

And because of the relationship between karma and power, people will have various karmic feelings and emotions before death.

For example, if you are engaged in killing karma and often kill living beings before your death, you will feel that all the animals you killed in your lifetime will trample your body, or you will be squeezed or smashed by huge mountains and boulders in the shape of the killed animals. There are many such horrible feelings.

The most pitiful people are those who do not understand the process of death, whose karmic obstacles are relatively heavy, and they did not study the Buddhadharma, or did not have any religious beliefs or practices during their lifetime, and they will feel very painful at this time.

Because they don't understand  non-existence, the constant, and the choice, their heart will always be in pain because they don't let go of money, relatives and friends;

And because there is no belief, they feel helpless, full of fear of the unknown, and unable to get avoid death, very desperate.

Parents, wives and children, who thought they would never be separated in their entire lives, would suffer from love and separation when they faced parting or death.

We hope that our life is a life full of love, and we can be with those who love each other, but we don’t know that this life is full of the suffering of separation and separation can happen at any time.

Shantideva Bodhisattva said in "Entering the Way of the Bodhisattva":

Love each other while with each other,

the god of death prompts us to leave,

and suffer unbearable pain. 

This is a certain number in the world.

Blind and loving together, 

it seems that life and death will not be separated, 

but in the end they will leave each other.

Those who remain alive in the world suffer every day, and those who leave go to the other side and continue to suffer from rebirth.

Because our love is small love, greedy, not selfless, great love.

Small love is easy to lose, and it will be painful if you lose it. The deeper you love, the more painful it will be.

Great love is to love all beings in the six realms. There are countless sentient beings in the six realms. Therefore, great love will not be lost and will not suffer any pain.

##### 6. Resentment

Things you don't want to meet, people you don't want to meet,

But it is often encountered, that is, resentment and bitterness.

Karma is incredible, you have to experience the consequences yourself when you create your own karma.

No one wants to have grievances and creditors, but because they have committed non-virtuous deeds and offended sentient beings, there are many grievances and creditors;

24

If you don't want to see a ghost, you will meet a ghost, even if you are afraid, you can't hide;

We don't want to offend demons, but because of killing,

Some sentient beings who have been killed have been reincarnated as demons.

This will cause resentment and bitterness.

Often when we see an enemy or a deadly enemy, our hearts beat faster and we can't control it. We feel anxious and miserable.

No one wants to experience this kind of suffering, but it happens naturally.

Therefore, one should earnestly study the Dharma regularly, persist in our practice, do more life-releasing and almsgiving, and then dedicate the merits of the practice.

When the karma between you and all sentient beings is eliminated, this kind of suffering is also eliminated.

##### 7. Suffering of dissatisfaction

We human beings have too many demands. We ask for money but can't get it, we ask for work but can't get it, and we ask for health but can't get it.

Asking for something but never getting it, these are all pains.

##### 8. The Suffering of the Five Aggregates

The five aggregates or heaps of clinging are:

1. form (or material image, impression) (色)
2. sensations (or feelings, received from form) (受)
3. perceptions (想)
4. mental activity or formations (行)
6. consciousness (识)


To put it simply, "form" is our body;
"feeling" is the feeling of pain and pleasure;

"perception" is thought;

The content of mental formations includes a lot, "form, feeling, perception", other than that are mental formations, including the emptiness of the nose, ears, and mouth;

"Consciousness" is sense consciousness, including eye-consciousness, ear-consciousness, nose-consciousness, tongue-consciousness, and body-consciousness.

The Five Aggregates of form, feeling, perception, mental formations, and consciousness, especially the aggregate of form , include the five sense organs: eyes, ears, nose, tongue, and body.

The suffering of the five aggregates means that the body is the root and vessel of suffering. Once the body of the five aggregates is formed, there will be suffering.

For example, if afflictions are water, then the body is a water tank that holds water for afflictions. With a body in which the five aggregates are in present, all kinds of afflictions and sufferings will come.

Therefore, the body which unites the five aggregates is itself a type of great suffering. The first seven types of suffering must be experienced by the body of the five aggregates. If there is no body of the five aggregates, the first seven types of suffering will not appear. There is no way to feel.

Therefore, it is said that the "five aggregates" are the basis for sentient beings to experience suffering.

In addition, since the five aggregates are also impermanent, looking at them separately, each of the five aggregates is also full of suffering.

First of all, look at the aggregate of form, that is, our body. This body is also impermanent. It changes every day.

Looking at the aggregate of feeling , many of the feelings of suffering and happiness are suffering.

Perception refers to thinking. Our minds are thinking about messy and bad things. We can’t get what we want, and it’s also very painful.

Looking at the aggregate of mental formations, the range of formations is very wide. All things and ten thousand things other than form, feeling, perception, and consciousness are all formations, including space, nirvana, and so on.

TODO

The space inside the human body is also a mental formation. If the space inside the human body is gone, it will be very hard.

For example, you are hungry, and you see something delicious, so you eat until you are full, and there is no room left, it will be very painful.

Consciousness is the mind, also known as mind. The external environment is impermanent. When the mind feels happiness, it will soon become misery.

The mind does not want to experience painful things, but it can always feel it, so it is always in pain.

Buddhas have no physical body, and the bodies of bodhisattvas below the seventh level are similar. The light body of consciousness, the bodhisattvas of the eighth level and above, and the Arhats of the fourth fruit have obtained the true light body of wisdom. The light body of wisdom has only happiness and no pain.

The physical body of our five aggregates will have all kinds of pain, that is, even if there is no pain for the time being, ss long as the five aggregates are still there, all kinds of suffering will follow.

The suffering of the five aggregates is a type of suffering, and it is the root of all suffering in this life and in the future, because the various sufferings of the five aggregates cause us to be in samsara all the time. Only by knowing more about the suffering of the five aggregates can we truly be disenchanted with samsara, and develop renunciation.

The sufferings of people in the six realms are mainly the eight sufferings.

Human suffering is endless, because there are many sufferings that we didn’t know before, but only after we study the Buddhadharma do we realize that there are so many sufferings.

It turns out that we have been suffering in ignorance, and what we used to think is beautiful, as soon as we carefully analyze and feel it, find that it is actually suffering. 

27


For example, the daily necessities of life are suffering. 

When eating, when the food is placed on the table, it looks beautiful and very appetizing, but when eating, it is chewed and chewed in the mouth until it is mashed up before swallowing.

Seeing this, no one would want to eat the food, and they can swallow it because they have not seen it. Therefore, the food that eaten is not really dry, clean and fresh.

The same is true of where we live. No matter where we live, after a period of time, we will be troubled in our minds. To other people, it looks like a very good house, but we will feel uncomfortable living there.

There are countless troubles even with one item of clothing.

When the weather is neither cold or hot, it is more comfortable not to wear clothes, but it is necessary to wear them.

When the weather is cold and the cold is painful, we need to put on some more clothes;

In summer, when the weather is hot and the heat is painful, we need to take off some clothes. Sometimes that is not enough, and the air conditioner has to be turned on;

If you turn on the air conditioner too much, you will get sick. It's all trouble, and it's all pain.

There are also countless pains in daily life, the unavoidable pain of having to go to work;

At night there is fatigue, insomnia, nightmares, and pain.

In addition to these obvious pains, there are many other kinds of troubles.

Leaders have the troubles of leaders, bosses have the troubles of bosses, ordinary people have the troubles of ordinary people, and these troubles are also pains.

28

The Bodhisattva Asanga said that human beings have one hundred and ten kinds of suffering, but in fact it is far more.

After understanding the suffering of human beings, we should think about it again and again. We still need to be reborn in the next life. If we still want to become human, we must continue to suffer.

When we truly understand that we no longer want to be greedy for worldly wealth and no longer want to reincarnate as human beings, we will have the idea of renunciation from the suffering of humanity. This is also a kind of renunciation, but it is not the renunciation of the path of the middle scope.

### (3) Three Sufferings 

The three sufferings are: 

1. The suffering of suffering

2. The suffering of change

3. All-pervasive suffering

##### 1. The suffering of suffering

The suffering of suffering is the suffering of feeling. It can be said that it is suffering within suffering, sensitive suffering. The suffering that we all usually think of as suffering. 

##### 2. The suffering of change

The suffering of change is the suffering caused by the fact that life is constantly changing.
When you do get what you want, you can’t hold onto it. Even if things are going great now, it’s just a matter of time. The richest, most successful person in the world will eventually lose it all.

What we think of as happiness is not real happiness.

For example, eating seems to bring a kind of happiness, because when you eat, you usually feel very comfortable, and when you eat a big meal, you are even more happy.

If eating were really a kind of happiness, it should follow that the more you eat, the more you want to eat. The more you eat, the more you will be happy.

However, we all know that this is not the case. If you eat too much, it will cause you pain.

Why is this? It shows that the essence of eating is pain, and the feeling of happiness when eating is actually just a reduction in the pain of hunger.

The same is true of traveling or going on holiday. When we first set off, we are very excited and feel that the scenery is so beautiful, but if we keep walking, we would gradually get tired and bored of seeing it, and it would gradually become insufferable.

Such suffering is called suffering of change.

##### 3. All-pervasive suffering

All-pervasive suffering is the suffering of all things changing and impermanent.

It’s the general background of anxiety and insecurity that colors even our happiest moments. Deep down, we fear that life doesn’t offer us solid ground and that our very existence is questionable.

This kind of change is completely independent of our will and is non-negotiable, so it is a kind of coercion.

This impermanent, constant change is all-pervasive suffering.

Not only is life impermanent, but everything is impermanent, changing every moment.

Because of the pervasiveness of suffering, when we need help, we cannot get it;

30

When you want to rely on someone, you can't. You used to be able to rely on some kind of help, but things have changed. These are all suffering.

All-pervasive suffering is very subtle, it is relatively subtle impermanence, not gross impermanence.

Only enlightened sages, or people who have realized emptiness, can see it.

Most people need to use a magnifying glass to see tiny specks of dust.

The Second Jamyang Zhepa, Konchok Jigme Wangpo, was the abbot of Labrang Monastery.

In the past, the fastest way to travel was on horseback. It took seven days to travel from Xining to the Labrang Monastery in Gansu.

One time when he went to Labrang Monastery, the master was riding a horse, and he had been observing the sufferings along the way. When he arrived at the Labrang, he said that it took seven days to observe and understand sufferings, but it was not avery complete understanding.

Therefore, it is difficult to gain an understanding of all-pervasive suffering, because the afflictions and karma of sentient beings are constantly circulating, and the causes of all-pervasive suffering are constantly circulating and changing, so it is difficult to observe them clearly.

These are the three sufferings, and these are the sufferings common to the six realms.

### （4）The suffering of Asuras

The bitter asuras of the asura path are also called demi-gods, which means that compared to the gods, these living beings are like gods but not gods.

Asuras live on Mount Sumeru, below the sea level, there are four cities called Guguang, Yueman, Miao, Ju and Momo, and there is a certain distance between them and the heavenly realms.

31

Although Asuras are generally similar to beings in the celestial world, they cannot be compared with the celestial beings.

Asura beings are twice as tall as humans, a hundred times more beautiful than humans, and have some magical powers.

They are very rich, but no matter how great their riches and status, everything looks very, very bad to an Asura.

Nagarjuna Bodhisattva's "Letter to a Friend" says:

---

>
>The asuras begrudge the gods their splendor,
>
>Their inbred loathing thus torments their minds.
>
>Though clever, they’re obscured as all their kind,
>
>And so it is they cannot see the truth.
>

---

That is to say, although Asuras are very wealthy, beautiful in appearance, and have high wisdom, their minds are obscured by karmic obstacles and obstructions. This kind of mind does not have the chance to come into contact with the Buddhadharma, and thus will never be liberated. 

Beings in the heavens, the gods, often plunder the beautiful women of the asuras, and they can enjoy the nectar of immortality.

In addition, Asura can see with his supernatural powers that he is very jealous of the glory and wealth of the Thirty-Three Gods. Therefore, the Asura often go to war with heavenly beings, and also fight with wealthy Yaksha beings, and fight with the Eight Great Dragon Kings.

In war, they must first fight the dragons on all sides of Mount Sumeru, and sometimes they will beat the dragons.

32

Then they will fight the Four Heavenly Kings on the fourth level of Mount Sumeru. Here, they will generally not win.

Occasionally, they win, and will then attack the heaven of the Thirty-Three Gods.

Indra is the Emperor of the Thirty-Three Gods, and has thirty-two sons. These thirty-two sons are also kings and rule over the other thirty-two heavenly kingdoms, so they are called Thirty-Three Gods.

When fighting with heavenly beings, the Asuras often lose, and if they fight a hundred times, they may have a chance to win once in a while.

In battle, the elephant "Guardian" of the heavens can hurl enormous stones at the Asuras with a swing of their trunk.

Indra's mount is a three-headed fragrant elephant with a sword wheel on its nose, which can be rotated, and the sword wheel slashes the Asuras.

Even if a god is struck by a weapon, as long as the head is not injured, he will not die.

Once an Asura is hit in a vital point, it will be fatal, and if his limbs are cut off, he will be disabled and lose his ability to fight.

Therefore, every war always ends with the defeat of the Asuras, and there is almost never a chance of victory.

When we fight in the human world, even if both sides are evenly matched, the soldiers will have deep fears. When Asuras and the more powerful gods are fighting, their fears are indescribable. Male Asuras have to endure the pain of this fearful war all their lives.

In addition, due to frequent wars, millions of asuras die every time they fight. and there are many, many asuras who are disabled due to wars, and there is a lot of pain.

33

There is a lake in the Ashura world called "Tongguan Lake", which is like a live broadcast on TV. Although the  wives and children do not participate in the battle, and stay at home, they can still see their husbands, sons, fathers and brothers being killed in the projection on the lake. They suffer even more pain and are grief-stricken.

The splendor and wealth of the Asuras  was originally very good, but because of their greedy desire and jealousy, and delusional thinking, and by trying to rob heavenly beings, eventually harmed themselves.

### （五）The suffering of heavenly realms

There are several types of sentient being in the heavenly realms: the lowest level are the six heavens of the Desire realm, seventeen heavens in the Form realm, and four heavens in the Formless realm.

There are six heavens of the desire realm on six levels: 

1. the Heaven of the Four Great Kings, where one day is the equivalent of fifty years in the human world;

2. the Heaven of the Thirty-three Gods (ruled by Indra/Sakya), where one day is a hundred years in the human world;

3. Suyama (ruled by King Yama), where a day is two hundred years in the human world;

4. Tusita (home of the future Buddha Maitreya), where a day is four hundred years in the human world;

5. Sunirmita (the Heaven of Pleasant Transformations), where one day is eight hundred years in our world;

6. Paranirmita (abode of Mara), one day is 1,600 years in the human world.

34

##### 1. The six heavens of the desire realm

The six heavens of the Desire Realm are very rich. There are mountains of gold and silver, and all kinds of treasures are formed. The heavenly beings look at these the way we look at the stones on the mountain. It can be seen how rich the heavens are.
There are many beautiful flowers, many pools for bathing, and all kinds of lotus flowers bloom in the pools, which emit a very strong fragrance.

There is a wish-fulfilling tree in the heavens, if you need anything, the wish-fulfilling tree can satisfy it.

With a gust of wind, the clothes of the gods are changed into new ones. They are very beautiful, and they live very comfortably and freely.

The beings in the six heavenly  realms of the Desire Realm are more beautiful and richer than Asuras.

Their diet is nectar, and they eat a little nectar every day to satisfy the appetite.

The lifespans of heavenly beings are very, very long. According to the time in the heavens, some are five or six hundred years old, and some are several thousand years old.

But the heavenly beings will not practice the Dharma in their entire lifetimes. They will only enjoy themselves, and they will die when the accumulated merit of previous lifetimes are exhausted.

Death omens will appear in the last seven days before the death of a god. For example, the last seven days of the Four Heavenly Kings, the lowest of the six heavens in the Desire Realm, one day is equivalent to fifty years in the human world, and seven days are equal to three hundred and fifty years in our human world. During these three hundred and fifty years, there will be signs of death. 

There are ten kinds of death omens, divided into five death omens far away and five near death omens.

The "Letter to a Friend" says:

>
>Their bodies’ colors cease to charm and please,
>
>Their seats grow hard, their flowered wreaths do wilt,
>
>Their clothes are stained, and on their bodies now appear
>
>Rank drops of sweat they never had before.
>


>
>These five are signs that herald death in heaven,
>
>Appearing to the gods in their abodes.
>
>They’re not unlike the signs of death that warn
>
>Of coming death in humans on the earth.
>

35

These five signs of death that herald death and transmigration in the higher realms (meaning the god realms) occur for the gods living in the god realms of the world of desire, and are similar to the signs of death — the stench of death and so on — that announce approaching death in humans on earth.

The five signs heralding death are the phenomena that appear in the early stages of death, including (1) their beautiful complexions fade and they grow ugly; (2) their seats become uncomfortable to sit on; (3) the garlands of flowers with which they are adorned grow old; (4) stains appear on their garments; and (5) sweat, hitherto absent, now breaks out on their bodies and they smell foul.

From the moment of the death omens, the spirits of the heavenly beings are not good. They don't like it, their own throne has become hard, and they can't sit still anymore.

Encrusted with sweat, the crown of jewels and flowers in their hair also withers;

The flower garlands worn on the head, neck, and arms are very fragrant and beautiful. In a day in the world, they will naturally change three times. From the moment of the appearance of the signs of death, they cannot be replaced, and they will wither. Slowly getting old, smelly, and rotten, and they cannot be removed;

Then there are the stains on their clothes. 

In a day in the human world, as long as a gust of wind blows, the clothes of heavenly beings will not know, and they will change three times without realizing it, and they are also very beautiful clothes. Now they can't change. For example, the seven days of the Four Heavenly Kings are equivalent to three hundred and fifty years in the human world. During this period of time, they wear this suit every day. It has become stinky and tattered, and they can't change it. 

Thinking back over the previous enjoyment is very difficult for their minds to accept, but there was no way to go back.

People can buy new clothes when the the ones they have get old, but this is not the case in the heavens;

Then, the body sweats, the two armpits sweat naturally, and the body emits a great stench.

36

Heavenly people are born with a fragrant scent, and have never encountered a stench like this. Therefore, after the stench comes out, neither themselves nor the heavenly people around them can stand it, but they cannot escape, they can only endure it.

The five signs that death is near are more serious, including the sudden disappearance of body light, bathing, water on the body, uncontrollable music, blinking eyes, and reluctance to depart.

Before death, the heavenly beings are like corpses that make people fearful and disgusted, they are abandoned, and the other emperors and goddesses are unwilling to look at them.

When there are no signs of death, everyone plays together every day. If the signs of death appear, other heavenly being will keep far away from him, because the body is very smelly, and other heavenly beings can't stand it.

Some relatives and friends may pick up a few flowers from a branch, put them on his head, and say, "May you be born in this world after your death, and come to see us after accumulating blessings!" There will be no other expressions. There is no way to help him, only to let him die there in pain.

What is even more painful is that the celestial beings are called "those who know the three worlds", that is to say, after the celestial beings are born, they will know why they were born and became celestial beings;

Knowing when to die from the omen of death;

After death, where will you be reborn.

Knowing this makes it even more painful.

Heavenly beings have supernatural powers and can see their own future.

When you are not in hell, you can also see hell, and can see the suffering of all beings in hell, and think of your next life, it will be very painful.

some days

37

Some celestial beings know that they will become pigs and dogs in the human world in the next life. After seeing the life of pigs and dogs, they think of how they used to live on nectar. When they think of going to the human world to become a pig and eat those dirty things in the next life, their minds will be in very, great pain.

The grand enjoyment of the heavens makes the heavenly beings deplete their own accumulated merit, so most of them fall into the evil realms after death.

Since the heavenly beings know in advance where they will go in the next life, and that there is no way to change it, they are extremely distressed.

When we human beings die, most people do not know the next life, whether it will be good or bad, and they pass away in confusion, so the pain and anxiety are not so intense.

In addition, the blessings of the gods are not all the same. If the blessings are small, the gods will panic and fear when they see great power and benefit. The gods with great blessings often oppress the gods with lesser blessings.

The light from the body of gods with great merit is very strong, and the light from the body of gods with lesser merit is relatively weak. When the two meet, the pressure on the gods with lesser merit is very, very large, and the gods with lesser merit will be driven away from their dwelling places and suffer great pain and sorrow.

When fighting with Asuras, although generally speaking the gods will win, the gods also have the pain of being injured and being killed in the process of fighting.

If you are reborn in one of the six heavens of the Desire Realm, your enjoyment will be equivalent to tens of thousands of years in the human world. Once the merit accumulated in previous lives is completely exhausted in this rebirth, and since new merit cannot be accumulated, the vast majority of heavenly beings will fall into the evil realms after death, almost 100%.

Therefore, when we look at them, although they can be extremely happy in their lifetimes, their endings in the later rebirths are actually very painful.

When we understand this, we will generate renunciation, to leave the six heavens of the desire realm, and also to avoid the enjoyment of the heavenly world, and vow not to be reborn in the six heavens of the desire realm in the next life, and not to become a deity in the desire realm.

##### 2. The Suffering of the Form Realm

There are also gender differences in the six heavens of the Desire Realm. Starting from the Heaven of the Form Realm, the heavens and men are no longer divided into genders, but they can be distinguished according to their bodies. A little difference, no gender difference.

Men are thicker and heavier, there is such a little difference, and there is no difference in gender.

In the devas of the seventeen heavens of the form realm the difference is greater. The devas of the form realm are twice as tall as the devas of the desire realm, and they are more beautiful than the devas of the desire realm. good day.

In terms of diet, nectar is used for the six heavens of the desire realm, whereas in the form realm nectar is not even used. Eating and drinking is meditation. Once you are born, you have the ability to meditate, but it does not mean that you are always in meditation.

The life of the beings of the Form Realm is also much longer than that of the Six Heavens of the Realm of Desire, but they are still enjoying themselves all the time. The moment the accumulated merit is exhausted, they will also die. There are no signs of immanent death. After death, he will fall into suffering of the evil realms.

##### 3. The Suffering of the Formless Realm

In the suffering of formless realm,  formlessness means that there is no body. In the four heavens of the formless realm, beings have no body. Only consciousness exists.

When the gods of the Formless Realm are born, they will have the consciousness and feeling that they have been born, and then they will enter the meditation, and they will not know anything.

They may spend hundreds or tens of thousands of kalpas in meditation, and after leaving meditation, they will die, and they will suffer very little.

Although the Heavens of the Form Realm and the Formless Realm are not like the Six Heavens of the Desire Realm, they have signs of immanent death and present pain, but they are still haunted by the suffering of actions, and they also have afflictions and obstacles, and they cannot live and die freely.

Therefore, it is said in the "The Advice for Gathering Accumulations":

The heavens of form and formlessness,

transcending suffering and suffering,

take peace and joy as their nature,

they will not be moved in aeons, 

but they will not be liberated in the end, 

and they will still fall from there.

Therefore, it is not good to be reborn as a god. Many people think that it is a good thing to be a god. In fact, it is a big loss to be a god.

Just keep consuming the blessings, not accumulating Reward;

40



There will be no repentance because of the lack of pain, and karma will not be eliminated.

Therefore, although heavenly beings are extremely happy, they are only so temporarily, and after death they will still fall into evil.

And because heavenly beings can live for a long time, just enjoying themselves for tens of thousands of kalpas, which will habitually block the operation of wisdom. Therefore, after being reborn, they will become more stupid than ordinary people. Then, practice is more difficult, and it is more difficult to attain liberation.

If we think about it carefully, we will find that in the six realms, everything is unreliable, impermanent, and full of suffering.

When you understand this, you will have thoughts of wanting to get out of the six realms of samsara. This kind of thought of wanting to be freed from the suffering of the six realms is called renunciation or aversion to the realms of samsara or disgust with all of cyclic existence.

Attaining the mind of renunciation can be said to be a kind of achievement. 
After renunciation, the mind will not turn back once the mind is really firm.

People who have achieved renunciation will see life differently.

For example, ordinary people are envious of rich people, but if they attain the mind of renunciation, they will know that being rich is a disaster.

When ordinary people have money, it will generally lead to greater greed for and unwholesome actions, or they will use money to do bad things. Therefore, when people who have obtained renunciation look at the world, prosperity and wealth are fire pits.

41

For example, when a few people happily gather together for a meal, a dozen or so dishes, ordinary people will think this is normal, whereas those who have obtained renunciation will think that these people are very pitiful, since they are consuming merit, and they do not understand Cause and effect.

This is how accomplished people look at ordinary people;

Ordinary people look at accomplished people, and sometimes feel weird and don’t understand them.

After attaining renunciation and bodhicitta, a person's mind will undergo essential changes. At this time, a great compassion for saving sentient beings has arisen in his mind, and he is able to regard all sentient beings in the six realms as his own mother. Therefore, you can live in harmony with people in the world, and together, your conversations will be very mysterious.

42

## Section 2 - The Truth of the Cause of Suffering

The second section, the truth of the cause suffering, includes the afflictions, karma, death, the bardo, and birth.

In the Truth of Suffering, we talked about the suffering of sentient beings in the six realms. 

What then is the cause that makes sentient beings suffer? 

The Truth of the Cause of Suffering, that is, afflictions.

1. Afflictions 

To understand afflictions, we must understand them from six aspects: 

the nature of afflictions;

the danger of afflictions;

the types of afflictions;

source of afflictions;

the cause of afflictions;

Troubled troubles.

(1) The nature of afflictions 

Afflictions are also called confusion. When you have afflictions, your mind will be restless and unsettled, always worried and uncomfortable.

So, in essence, affliction is a state of mind that makes the mind unsettled and uncomfortable.

The "unquiet mind" mentioned here refers to the lack of attraction to or interest in good things, and the craving and pursuit of non-good things, which leads to restlessness.

43

##### (2) The harm of afflictions 

The harm of afflictions is that it will lead to the creation of karma, creating more and greater karma.

We already know that the essence of the six realms of samsara is suffering, to get out of samsara is to get rid of suffering;

And in order to get rid of suffering, we must find the root of suffering, and eliminate it.

So, what is this root? It is karma and afflictions. Sentient beings create karma because of afflictions, and the result of karma is suffering.

In the training of the lower scope, We have learned that falling into the lower realms is due to karma.

Since karma also arises because of afflictions, the cause of our rebirth is karma and afflictions, but compared with karma, afflictions are more harmful.

Because karma is also driven by afflictions, it is afflictions that make us continue to create karma.

Moreover, afflictions are conditions, and past karma is the cause. Even though countless old karmas have been created in the past, if there are no afflictions, just like a seed cannot germinate without water, no new karma will be created.

For example, after attaining the status of Arhat, although the past karma is still there, because the afflictions are eliminated, no new negative karma will be created.

On the contrary, even if there is no karma created in the past, as long as there are afflictions, new karma may be created at any time, which will lead to samsara and suffering in the future.

In The "Commentary on Valid Cognition" (Pramanavarttika):

If there is love already saved, 

the remaining karma will not be able to lead, 

because it is born out of existence.

It also says:

If there is a lover, 

it is even more for the sake of life.

That is to say, if you cut off the "becoming" and "craving" of the twelve causal links of dependent origination, you will not create new karma, because you have cut off the innate afflictions.

If there is "craving", you will still suffer from rebirth.

Among the twelve causal links of dependent origination, "becoming" is cause, and "craving" is affliction.

Therefore, afflictions are the root of rebirth and are extremely harmful.

##### (3) Types of afflictions 

Once you know the dangers of afflictions, you must eliminate them. First, you must recognize afflictions.

There are two types of afflictions (known as hindrances): The "two hindrances" are the afflictive hindrances (煩惱障 kleśa-āvaraṇa) and cognitive hindrances (所知障 jñeya-āvaraṇa).

OR fundamental afflictions and secondary afflictions.

Cited from: The Yogācāra Two Hindrances and Their Reinterpretations in East Asia http://www.acmuller.net/articles/reinterpretations_of_the_hindrances.html#ixzz7cEnEPrYE

Six Root Defilements (six primary afflictions)

There are six root defilements: greed, hatred, delusion, arrogance (pride), doubt, and wrong view.

##### (1) Covetousness is greed for what one loves.

When there is greed, the mind will definitely be restless and uncomfortable.

In the "Mahayana Abhidharma Collection" written by the Bodhisattva Asanga, it is said: 

Greed is the craving of the world, and it is said to be inseparable from the object. there is a reason why "greed" is listed first in the six root afflictions.

The six root afflictions can be summarized into the Three Poisons of ignorance, attachment, and aversion (or greed, hate, and delusion, OR ignorance, craving and clinging) and the Three Poisons can be further summarized into greed. Therefore, greed is the initial and root of all afflictions.

Greed is also the root cause of our suffering in samsara.

According to the teaching of the Twelve Causal Links of Dependent Origination, after greed there will be "craving", "grasping", and then "becoming".

Here "craving" and "grasping" are afflictions, and "becoming" is karma, and karma will be created when afflictions exist.

After "becoming" there is rebirth, then greed arises, and greed regenerates karma.

This will never stop, the afflictions will increase, and the karma will become heavier and heavier.

So, if you cut off greed, you can get out of samsara.

##### （2）Anger

(2) Anger is hatred and regret, hating what one does not love, and hating things or beings one does not love.

It is the mentality of having hatred and rudeness towards sentient beings, and wanting to hurt others.

For example, on seeing an enemy or a rival, the mind becomes extremely violent and eager to hurt the other party.

Sometimes there is also anger towards inanimate objects, such as getting angry and smashing a cup.

Among all the afflictions, hatred is the worst kind, and it is the main culprit that destroys the good roots and leads into the three evil realms.

When hatred arises, it is like oil on fire, and there is no time to stop it. Every act of hatred can destroy the good virtues and blessings of many kalpas. The fault is extremely serious.

Most of the murders, and fights in the world are caused by hatred. It even starts wars, causing ever more sentient beings to lose their lives.

How can we stop anger? It is necessary to practice forbearance often.

In the Treatise on Entering Bodhisattva Actions, it says:

---

A stubborn person is like an empty space, 

how can it be completely subdued, 

completely destroy this hatred, 

it is like breaking down all enemies.

---

That is to say, there are so many stubborn sentient beings in the world that they are as numerous as emptiness and innumerable. How could it be possible to subdue them all? But, yes, if you can quench your inner hatred, it will be like annihilating all external enemies.

And it also says:

---

There is nothing more sinful than anger, 

and nothing more than forbearance.

Therefore, hatred is extremely harmful, 

and one must cultivate tolerance.

---

In addition, we can also break the hatred by thinking about the subject that caused the hatred.

47

For example, after being scolded by others, we feel anger and hatred, and we have to think: What do I hate about him? If you hate this person, do you hate his body or his mind? Or hate what he said? If you hate his body, his body is just a body, not to mention, it is not his body that drives him to scold me.

If you hate his mind? In fact, his mind is not free. It is influenced by afflictions, and becomes a slave to afflictions.

If you hate what he said, when he scolds you, his mind drives his mouth, and his mind is driven by his afflictions;

Moreover, he was swayed by his own afflictions without knowing it, and he is to be pitied.

Therefore, if you want to hate, you should hate his afflictions, not him.

It's like being beaten with a stick, it's the stick that really hits us, we should be angry with the stick, not with the one who holds the stick.

But how can we be angry with a stick? In the same way, for the same reason, it is his afflictions that make us feel resentful, and where are they?

In this way, we search one by one, and finally we will find that the root that really arouses hatred does not exist! Everyone is a slave to afflictions, and their minds are bound by afflictions and cannot be at ease.

We are also driven by afflictions to create karma, which is very pitiful.

Thinking of this, it's not easy to feel resentment.

48

If you think like this often, you will gradually eliminate your hatred.

##### （3）Delusion

(3) （3）Delusion is also known as ignorance, not knowing the true nature of everything is ignorance.

Not understanding the emptiness of dependent origination, not understanding the causes and conditions of the six realms of samsara, afflictions, and suffering, not understanding that human beings have no independent self, and that objects have no self, all of these belong to the afflictions of ignorance.

For example, when it is almost dark, and you see a coil of rope, but mistakenly think it is a snake, you get a great fright. This is a typical example of the afflictions of ignorance.

Because there is no understanding of the true face of things (rope), attachment to self (snake) arises. Once attached, a lot of problems and pain (fear) arise. As the ego grows, the stronger the ego, the more karma is created, and the more afflictions and sufferings that follow.

Delusion is divided into two parts: attachment to self and attachment to phenomena.

Once the attachment to self or ego and the attachment to phenomena are broken, other afflictions will be eliminated naturally. Therefore, ignorance is the source of afflictions.

##### （4）Pride

Pride is arrogance, that is, arrogance and self-satisfaction, looking down on others.

For example, if I have a little bit of culture, I feel great, and I feel self-satisfied and very proud.

49

Or if you have a little money, you take your own money very seriously. These are all expressions of arrogance.

For another example, during the conversation, someone said, "So-and-so can understand the Dharma very well."

If that person also feels that he has a relatively good, deep understanding of the Buddhadharma, this is also arrogant, because the Buddhadharma is not easy to understand.

The root of arrogance is also attachment to self or ego. To combat arrogance, we must pay attention to being humble in life.

Frequent prostrations and obeisance to Buddhas and Bodhisattvas can also effectively combat arrogance.

If a person is often arrogant, the retribution in a later life will be very bad, and he may become a slave, a servant, and someone who serves others.

Every slave and maid is a slave, or a servant or a maid, due to previous karma created in  previous lives, and they could be reborn in the evil realms.

A servant who looks miserable now must have been the most arrogant person in a certain life.

##### (5) Doubt 

Doubt or unbelief, including the inability to believe in the truth of Buddhism, the power of good and evil karma, and all the facts in the world, which leads to blocking, blocking good doors, breeding wrong views, and creating right and wrong karma.

Doubt is the biggest obstacle to achievement.

Even if the practice is very diligent, but because doubts gradually arise in the heart, such as doubting whether it is true or not, there is cause and effect;

50

After doing good deeds, one wonders whether there is such a great reward as the Buddhist scriptures say, and whether doing evil deeds really has evil rewards, etc. It will make it difficult for the roots of good deeds to arise, and the practice will become more and more difficult, and it cannot be successful.

The big doubt is to doubt the Three Jewels, to doubt the truth of cause and effect.

Many beginners and Buddhists have had this kind of thought.

In the past, there was a teacher named Zunzhi Sangge, who practiced very well and met Manjushri Bodhisattva at the age of sixteen.

He was very poor at that time, and sometimes it was difficult to maintain three meals a day. Some corals and shells left by his family were his only valuable.

Once, when he saw Manjushri Bodhisattva again, he asked the Bodhisattva: "Manjushri Bodhisattva, I am so poor, I can't guarantee three meals a day, how can I practice in the future?" 

Manjushri Bodhisattva said: "First sell ​​the coral and make offerings to the Three Jewels, and then I will take you to find a great treasure."

After hearing the words of Manjushri, he sold the coral, took the money, and offered it to a monk.

Then he was taken to a cave by Manjushri Bodhisattva, and the Bodhisattva said: "This is the treasure, you can practice well here, that's all."

He listened to the Bodhisattva's words and practiced in the cave with peace of mind.

After insisting on this for a few months, no one knows why, but slowly, everyone living at the foot of the mountain knew that there was a master here who was in retreat, and they kept feeding him and supporting him.

He thought it was very strange, so he asked Manjushri Bodhisattva: "My practice in the past was also good, why am I still so poor? Why do people make offerings to me after offering sacrifices to the monks?"

 Manjushri Bodhisattva said: "You were also a practitioner in his previous life, but you lived by stealing things, and even stealing things while reciting the Manjushri mantra.

Good or evil, the karma is not bad at all, if you stole in a past life, you will be poor in this life;

If you recite a lot of Manjushri mantras, you will be able to see Manjushri in person.

However, even if you can see me, I can't make you no rich, I can only teach you to sell the coral and make offerings to the monks, your blessings will increase, and naturally someone will come to support you. "

A master who can see Manjushri is so poor that he can't eat, and then he is full of three meals. How can this happen? It is because the merits are different. Master Zunzhi Sanger has the merit of practicing the Dharma, but not the reward of abundance.

The causes and conditions of each kind of result are different. The causes of Dharma practice, the causes of abundance, the causes of longevity, and the causes of health all exist separately.

Some people will live a long life, but will lack wealth all their lives, because the reason for getting rich is not there;

Some people are very rich, but they have short lives, because there is no reason for longevity;

Some people are rich and healthy, but they are stupid because they have no wisdom.

If you don't understand these things, you will be suspicious of cause and effect.

52

In addition, cause and effect are true, and everyone will be treated fairly.

Learning, Buddhists and good people will also receive evil retribution. This is the evil and karma of the past, which has led to the evil results of today.

Therefore, we should not doubt learning Buddhism, and do not think that learning Buddhism is useless just because learning Buddhism will also be rewarded.

People who study Buddhism have a chance of being saved even if there is evil retribution.

For example, after many people get terminal illness, they can finally recover through reciting Buddha, doing prostrations, releasing animals, etc.

There are also some kind people whose karma in the previous life made them poor and sick in this life. After learning Buddhism, they were eliminated through the blessing of the Three Jewels, their sufferings were eliminated, and they were reborn in the Pure Land.

On the contrary, after the evil retribution of many wicked people is revealed, they lose the chance to be saved.

Some people have done bad things, but they live very comfortably. This is because of the blessings of their past lives. Although they have done a lot of bad things in this life, the blessings of their past lives are great and have not been exhausted. If you can continue to maintain it, you will fall into the evil path after the blessings are exhausted.

So, no, you can doubt and misunderstand cause and effect, cause and effect are inconceivable, not so easy and easy to understand.

After realizing emptiness, even if it is not the actual realization, but the actual realization of emptiness, from this moment on, there will be no doubts about cause and effect. Because after realizing emptiness, the understanding of cause and effect will be very deep, and you will believe in cause and effect without doubt.

53

The "Dharmakaya" says:

>
>All dharmas arise from conditions, 
>
>all dharmas die from conditions,
>
>I, the great recluse of the Buddha,
>
>often say the same thing.
>

The Buddha talks about dependent origination and emptiness, and believes that all dharmas are dependent origination, all are cause and effect.

We all know that none of the myriad causes and myriad effects independently, but exist in an interdependent relationship.

For example, a cup has many materials inside and outside. It is not unique. It is made of many materials.

At the same time, all things are inherently empty, that is, without self-nature, impermanent.

It's changing every moment, it's just me, we can't see it.

After realizing emptiness, all these will be clear and clear. If you realize the principle of impermanence, you will be very close to realizing emptiness.

The deeper and wider the understanding of cause and effect, the more helpful it is to understand emptiness.

Therefore, those who truly understand the emptiness of dependent origination will not doubt cause and effect.

People who don't really understand may have doubts if they encounter unsatisfactory things. Therefore, they should study diligently and understand more about emptiness, and they will be more suspicious.

Small doubts are common doubts in daily life, and such doubts are also very harmful.

Especially between relatives and friends, it will cause family and friendship to not last long.

54

In particular, doubts between friends, teachers, and brothers can be very troublesome.

Because there is a kind of common liberation between brothers and friends, and when this kind of relationship exists, there is trust and responsibility between each other, and they feel that they are relying on each other.

If the teacher and the brother are dissatisfied and suspicious because of a little thing, it will destroy the relationship.

There will be many difficulties on the way to becoming a Buddha. In practice, having good teachers and helpful friends will give us a lot of help and confidence. There is a scripture, so it goes like this:

Someone fell into a deep hole and cried out for a long time, hoping someone could save him.

The other man heard it, came to the entrance of the cave, put down a rope, and the man in the cave grabbed the rope tightly.

At this time, many people came, and they pulled the rope together with the people at the entrance of the cave, and rescued this person.

In this allusion, the people who fell into the hole are us, the deep hole is equivalent to the evil way, the person at the entrance of the hole is the Buddha, the rope and the child are the Dharma, and the people who help pull the rope are the Dharma friends, Jin, Brother Gang.

Therefore, we need to recognize the suffering of the three evil realms, but how to get rid of this kind of suffering is to follow the guidance of the Buddha, practice diligently, and practice the Buddhadharma. Free together with help.

Once you recognize your doubts, you must deal with them.

When you have doubts, you should immediately realize that thinking in this way is a kind of doubt, and then warn yourself not to think wildly;

Or think more about the consequences of doubt, yes, it will also help to cure doubt.

When we get rid of doubts, we get rid of great troubles. The Buddha told us to be honest and open-minded.

A person who is paranoid all day long and can't do anything.

(6) Non-right view Non-right view is also called evil view, which refers to views that violate Buddhist teachings, and can be divided into five types.

1) Bad gathering is bad gathering, bad refers to the five aggregates of impermanence;

Collection means the concentration of the five aggregates;

Seeing is a view that the five aggregates are "I". This view is not right view, and this kind of unright view is called bad aggregate view.

In other words, clinging to one's own body is the "I", and clinging to the false appearance of the "I" is the real self.

In fact, it has fallen into the common, the constant edge, also known as the view.

Before the realization of emptiness, most people hold views or fall into it.

Until you understand emptiness, you will no longer fall into the two sides of detachment and constancy, and you will realize that the most correct thing is centeredness, insight.

2) Side-attachment to seeing and side refers to the permanent side or the broken side, and the attachment refers to the attachment to the permanent (eternal, eternal) or broken (non-existence) of all things.

In the process of searching for emptiness, there will be two kinds of unrighteous views. One is that if everything exists, then everything must be eternal.

This kind of view has fallen into the ordinary side, and it is called common.

Another kind of unrighteous view is: if everything is impermanent, then everything must not exist.

Those who hold a judgmental view are prone to fall into stubborn emptiness, and if it is more serious, they will develop to the point of not recognizing past and future lives, rebirth and cause and effect, thinking that since all things and dharmas are empty, there is nothing.

Therefore, the most harmful thing among the unrighteous views is the broken view.

Boundary view is an unrighteous view.

Our right view is the middle view, see, and take the middle way. To put it simply, it is: the universe and everything in the universe, and Luo is neither permanent nor non-existent;

Everything is impermanent, but it exists.

57

3) Seeing Seeing Seeing as a kind of unrighteous view, it is only available to outsiders.

There are two kinds: one is forbidden to take the view, and the other is to be forbidden to take the view.

【Referring to the prohibition】

Some heretics believe that the Lord of the world is the King of Great Freedom, or the King of Brahma. In order to obtain liberation, one must devote allegiance to the Lord.

The way to offer loyalty is to commit suicide, or kill one's own children, loved ones, or even one's own benefactors.

This kind of precept is called abstinence from taking views, and a precept is formed based on wrong and delusional views. Such precepts are naturally evil precepts.

In the past, there were many such heretics in India. They used a three-pronged sword, the point of the sword stood upright, and jumped up to the sword, allowing the middle sword to pass from the buttocks to the top of the head, and the two sides to the shoulders, thinking that this would give loyalty and give Lord, and then freed.

These are wrong views, a kind of wrong, right views.

Before Shakyamuni Buddha was born, heretics in India often came in waves one after another, and on the festival of the Heavenly King of Great Freedom, the sky jumped on the sword.

Whoever can dance correctly, everyone will worship him, thinking that he is freed.

If you can't jump, it's useless to jump on.

58

Although many heretics have good deeds and do good deeds, such as meeting, giving, saving people, not telling lies, and some not killing or eating meat, but every kind of heresy has unrighteous views.

Most heretics believe that all things are created by a creator, not caused by cause and effect.

Many sectarians in India believe that the creator of the world is the King of Great Freedom, and some people think that it is the King of Brahma.

They believe that the four races of Indians were born from the four faces of the great, Brahma king.

There are also some heretics who believe that yes, they are born from the four parts of the body of the Brahma: the Brahmin caste is born from the forehead of the Brahma;

Kshatriya was born from the heart of Brahma, the king;

The commoner Vaishya was born from the navel of the Great Brahma;

The lowest-ranked Sudra was born from the anus of the Great Brahma.

They were all created by the Great Brahma Heavenly King, and this is not right view.

Po, the Romans believe that all things were created by the Great Brahma King, and the earth was also created by the Great Brahma King;

Catholics believe that the earth and all things were created by God.

In short, heretics believe that all things are created by a single master, and do not recognize cause and effect.

Cause and effect clearly exist, so if you plant melons, you will get melons, if you plant beans, you will get beans, and if you plant them, they will grow.

If you want to give birth to a person, as long as the two get married, they can have a child, and it is not created by the Great Brahma. This is easy to understand.

However, people cannot understand when their wrong views are profound. These are all unrighteous views, and they are all troubles.

59

In addition, from the perspective of Tantra, it is not allowed to harm the body at will after holding an unrighteous view.

Because when cultivating the qi meridian, the injured part of the body will have obstacles, so it is necessary to protect and maintain the body.

If you don't practice Tantra, but only practice Xianzong, there may be some sayings about giving the body and so on in the method of Xianzong.

In order to express confidence in Buddhas and Bodhisattvas, some disciples burn lamps with their fingers to make offerings to Buddhas, which is not allowed in Tantric Buddhism.

In Tantra, there is also the practice of giving to the body, but you must cultivate to a certain level, and you can only be above the Bodhisattva.

【Forbidden to take and see】

The prohibition of taking opinions refers to some misunderstandings and behaviors of foreigners in their behavior.

For example, some heretics think that being naked is the only way to get rid of it, so just stay naked all day long;

There are some outsiders who stand on one leg all day, from sunrise to sunset, looking at the sun all the time, thinking that this will lead to liberation.

There are also some heretics who hold the ox precept, the dog precept, the chicken precept, etc., because they have some supernatural powers, and when they see some chickens and dogs die and ascend to heaven, they think they are freed, and they are very envious.

60

But they don't understand that these animals ascend to heaven because of their own karma.

I thought it was because of their behavior and habits that were different from human beings, so I demanded myself according to the life characteristics of these animals. For example, those who held chicken precepts stood on one leg like chickens every day;

Those who hold the ox precept will imitate cows to bow their heads and eat grass, etc.

These are all prohibitions.

4) Wrong views are incorrect views. For example, not believing in the right Dharma and the cause, effect, good and evil are all wrong views.

5) The first view refers to the above-mentioned "bad view, side-attached view, and wrong view".

Clinging is attachment and not letting go, which is a wrong view that is true to the three kinds of negativity and right view.

This view is also called "not-fruit-planning-fruit", which is the illusion that one has not yet attained the holy fruit, but is delusional about having obtained the holy fruit.

Twenty Suffering Defilements Supplementary Defilements are also called Sui-sleep Defilements and Sui Defilements, which are defilements that arise along with the root defilements.
61

There are twenty kinds of afflictions that follow: anger, hatred, anger, harm, jealousy, slander, flattery, arrogance, arrogance, no shame, no shame, unbelief, laziness, laziness, drowsiness, forgetfulness, distraction, and delusion , Unrighteous knowledge.

(1) Anger is anger. The object is the opposite of one's own heart, and the situation, such as an unpleasant person, object, environment, event, etc., makes him lose his temper.

How to deal with anger? After getting angry, think more about losing your temper, the fault of your anger, or dealing with anger by practicing forbearance. Make a vow first, for example, get up early every day and make a vow: I will practice forbearance today, and if people scold me or blame me, I will not lose my temper. This vow, too, will effectively deal with anger.

Seeing that some senior brothers are going to lose their temper, fellow practitioners can remind each other.

But when some people are angry, others remind them to regenerate. If they are angry, if they are always so angry, their anger will turn into hatred, and their troubles will become more serious.

There are nine objects of hatred, divided into three categories.

(2) Hate 62

The first category is to hate those who have hurt me before, are hurting me now, and will hurt me in the future.

The second category is to hate those who have harmed my relatives and friends in the past, are now harming my relatives and friends, and will harm my relatives and friends in the future.

The third category is to hate those who have helped my enemies before, are helping my enemies now, and will help my enemies in the future.

When I think of these people, the mentality in my heart that I never forget the harm that these people have brought to me, or may have brought me, and even the idea of ​​revenge, is hatred.

Anger is a state of anger and anger towards the current situation, that is, the person, thing, and thing in front of you. Hate is generally a state of mind that arises from people and things that happened in the past.

Hate itself is a great pain, and it is necessary to deal with hatred and cultivate tolerance.

Or think about it from another angle, what would you think if you were hated and hated by others.

Think again, life is impermanent, today, it is the enemy, not necessarily in the future, it may also be kind to yourself, people.

If you think about it like this often, hatred will not arise.

Somewhere in Tibet, there were two people who fought and fought in the past. One of them suffered a big loss and hated the other all the time. All day long, thinking about revenge, he practiced martial arts.

Once when he went swimming, he went deep and sank in the water. There were many people at that time, but no one dared to go into the water. In the end, it was his enemy who jumped into the water to save him, if not for his enemy. , he will surely die.

63

Therefore, no, there is an eternal enemy, and the current enemy may be himself, his benefactor, or his children and parents in the next life.

On the other hand, when hatred is in the heart, the body will feel heavy, like a mountain, and it will be overwhelming.

When you realize that hatred is what it is, the hatred mentality disappears, and the body immediately relaxes.

Therefore, hatred will make our body and mind uncomfortable, stressful, angry for no reason, and more likely to get sick because of it, which is not good for ourselves.

(3) Annoyance is hot annoyance, which is a state of being irritable, hot, and restless about the situation in front of you that makes you unhappy.

Sometimes, the mentality of anger and hatred continues to enlarge, and the more you think about it, the more uncomfortable it becomes, the more you feel at ease, the faster your heart beats, and the more you start to get irritable, and it will also become irritable.

Even being angry enough to throw things, scold or hit people, also adds trouble to others.

Cultivation of forbearance can cure anger.

(4) To harm is to harm sentient beings.

64

On the one hand, after the agitation arises, one loses compassion and has a more intense impulse to use beating, killing, intimidating and other actions to force and harm sentient beings. , is the harmful aspect.

On the other hand, some people have heavy karma and lack compassion. Even if they are not disturbed by anger and anger, they will harm people, harm, and sentient beings for no reason.

For example, some people will kick a dog when they meet a dog on the side of the road, or often destroy things for no reason.

Harm is not actually harming others, but harming yourself.

Harmful people, with the same thoughts, is a huge karma, and the result is often felt, calling others to harm you.

Therefore, once the thought of harming others arises, you must catch it immediately, otherwise, this kind of thought will harm you for life after life.

The above four subordinate afflictions are all part of the six root afflictions, "anger". The object of anger and resentment are different, but in general, they are accompanied by "anger", and "harm" may not always be accompanied by anger and resentment. , arises from the heart.

As we have said, we need to cultivate forbearance to deal with anger. Therefore, for these four afflictions, the way to deal with them is also to cultivate forbearance.

(5) jealous 65

Seeing other people's beauty, health, wealth, happiness, success, merit, etc. surpassing one's own, the heart feels uncomfortable and unbalanced, this kind of mentality is jealous.

For those who are inferior to oneself, the afflictions that are easy to arise are arrogance and heart, and those who are better than themselves are easy to be jealous.

For those who are jealous, the antidote is to cultivate loving-kindness. Jealousy is the expression of lack of loving-kindness. If you have loving-kindness for someone, you will not be jealous of the other person. In addition, regular practice of rejoicing can also counteract jealousy.

When you realize that you are jealous, you can also think like this: Why are you jealous of this person? It is a good thing that he is better than me, and I should rejoice in his merits.

Or think from the perspective of bodhicitta: "Everyone, all living beings are my parents, and so is he.

So, he's better now, a little bit, and I should be happy.

"If you think about it often, you will slowly and slowly break your jealousy.

If you are jealous and often jealous of others, you will gradually lose your loving-kindness and compassion.

Jealousy is a kind of random affliction that is easy to arise. If not, if it is dealt with, jealousy will also cause other random afflictions. Then it will lead to "hate" and even "harm".

(6) False 66

There are two kinds of falsehood, one is false exaggeration;

The other is that they do not have any ability or merit, but they pretend to be with words and deeds.

The purpose is to seek fame and fortune.

For example, I have no ability at first, but pretend I have the ability to do something;

Or there is no merit, it is said that there is merit;

No supernatural powers, fake, with supernatural powers;

If you don't know how to teach the scriptures and teach the Dharma, and pretend to be able to teach the Dharma, doing so is a great sin.

(7) Flattery is to flatter others in order to win their trust, and to hide their own faults so as to avoid damage to fame and fortune.

To put it simply, flattery means being flattering and flattering others for the sake of fame and fortune.

Flattery and lie are both for fame and fortune, but they are not the same.

Falsehood is to gain fame and fortune through deception, and flattery is to preserve one's own fame and fortune through flattery and flattery.

We Buddhist disciples must be upright in character and have good moral character.

When doing things, you can use some convenient methods, but you must be honest.

Especially in front of people with great wisdom, being upright and talented, gaining the recognition of the other party, and being a good person are also the foundation of learning Buddhism well.

(8) Overlay 67

To cover is to hide sin.

Fu itself did not create karma in words and deeds, but for the evil karma he created in the past, for the sake of fame and fortune, deliberately concealing his own faults, no, let others know.

The greatest harm of overthrow and flattery is that karma cannot be eliminated.

If you want to eliminate karma, you must tell the karma, and then repent and repent.

After hiding the sins, the karma grows equally every day.

Therefore, we should try our best to speak out the karma that we can remember in front of Buddhas, Bodhisattvas and teachers, and repent.

In addition, although Fu and Flattery both deliberately hide their faults, they are not the same.

The answer is to hide one's own fault, do not want to be known by others, but have no special intentions for others;

Flattery is knowing that the other party can bring benefits to oneself, deliberately hiding one's own mistakes, in order to gain the other party's trust, thereby increasing fame and fortune.

(9) To be arrogant means to think that one's appearance, identity, wealth, knowledge, status, etc. are superior to others.

When you have this kind of mentality, you will look down on others, and you will not see the merits of others. It is easy to slander, teach the Dharma and the saints.

People in the world more noble than themselves, people of nobler race,

68

There are many richer people, more learned people, and people with higher status. If you think about these things often, you will not feel arrogant.

"Pride" is not the same as "slow" in the six root afflictions. Pride is a kind of arrogance that arises from oneself;

To be slow is to hold your heart high by comparing yourself with others and comparing yourself with others.

(10) To save is to be stingy.

Saving is formed by greed, but saving and greed are also different.

Covetousness means wanting more. Covetous people do not necessarily save money. Covetous people only hope that their wealth will continue to increase. However, when others have needs, they may give, give, or even take the initiative to give because of greed for merit and blessings.

To save is to have and be reluctant to give it to others. Those who save are bound to be greedy, because those who save are reluctant to give up anything, and even their own property is reluctant to use it for themselves, let alone share it with others.

The result of saving is that in later life you will fall into the realm of hungry ghosts.

Gazang Qusong, the master has an old friend in his hometown who is very, very stingy and very poor.

Hearing that he passed away, the master went back to see him and found that when he died, he was holding ten dollars tightly in his hand, and it took a lot of effort to open his hand.

When Master Gazang Qusong saw this situation, he said: "I will make a thousand offerings to Amitabha Buddha for him, otherwise, he will definitely fall into the realm of hungry ghosts.

69

"The master made a thousand offerings for an old friend, and saved him.

We must have a correct concept of possessions, and don’t be stingy when it comes to spending money;

Don't spend what you shouldn't spend.

Money should be spent meaningfully. Doing charity, making offerings to the Three Jewels, and releasing life are all good deeds that should be done. Don’t be stingy at this time. Doing so has great merit and is equivalent to burying a treasure that can be used in this life and in the next life.

(11) Shameless means no shame for one's own faults, no, self-respect, and dare to do evil things.

As Buddhist disciples, we should respect ourselves and love ourselves. We should always examine ourselves. If there are any mistakes, we should repent in time.

(12) Worthy and Worthy is when one’s faults are criticized and criticized by others, they are not ashamed, and they are not afraid of being sorry to others.

People who are worthy of shame and who don't care about their face will be looked down upon by everyone, and they will also lose the possibility of repenting their bad karma.

70

(13) Unbelief or unbelief refers to unbelief caused by an impure mind and inability to correctly understand the Three Jewels, Cause and Effect, and the Six Paths of rebirth.

Unbelief is different from "doubt" in the six root afflictions. Doubt refers to doubts about cause and effect and whether samsara exists or not, and is uncertain.

The essence of unbelief is ignorance, ignorance and ignorance caused by weak roots of goodness, karma, and deep obstacles.

Only believe in the visible cause and effect of the world, not in the invisible cause and effect of good and evil, nor in the Three Jewels, rebirth.

This kind of unbelief is not acquired by studying the scriptures, but is caused by misunderstandings about causality, rebirth, etc.

Not believing in cause and effect is very scary, because not believing in cause and effect, it means no self-discipline.

In this way, any evil deed may be done, which will lead to greater and greater suffering;

100% of the future generations will fall into the evil realm and suffer from purgatory.

1) Some people do not believe in the existence of the Buddha.

Such people can read more about the biography of Buddha Shakyamuni, and learn more about the merits and virtues of Buddha.

Every sentence spoken by Buddha Shakyamuni is the truth

71

All exist objectively. The more advanced science is, the more it can prove that the Buddhadharma is true and true.

Some people cannot believe in the Three Jewels because they have doubts in some aspects.

For example, there are questions about people who take refuge in Buddhism: why are there so many people who learn Buddhism are sick, why do they fail after learning Buddhism, why, there are so many people in Buddhism who have various problems, etc.

This is because the reasons for entering Buddhism are different.

Many people converted to Buddhism only after they had problems.

Some people took refuge because of illness, yes;

Some people took refuge because of bankruptcy;

Some of them failed to take refuge because of life, so it seems that there are people in Buddhism. There are many people who have problems. In fact, they are not. The problems of these people appeared before they took refuge in Buddhism.

Also, the process of becoming a congregation is different.

The believers of some religions become believers after birth, because their parents are believers, and their entry into a religion is based on the requirements of the religion they joined, as well as the influence of the religious community.

Because I joined the teaching from the moment I was born, I couldn't see how much difference there was before and after joining the teaching.

Buddhism is very harmonious, tolerant, and very strong. It is a voluntary conversion to Buddhism, so it has attracted sentient beings of various ages, age levels, various aptitudes, and various afflictions. In this way, from the outside, it seems like It's a misunderstanding that people who have entered Buddhism have certain questions. 72

Whether it is not believing in the existence of Buddha, or not believing in the Three Jewels due to doubts about Buddhism, it is a misunderstanding caused by not understanding Buddhism.

2) How to understand and accept karma. The incomprehension of good and evil results will also affect the belief in cause and effect.

Some people who do not understand cause and effect will misunderstand Buddhism and cause and effect if something bad happens.

For example, when you are seriously ill, you will think in your heart: If you study Buddhism and chant scriptures, you will still be sick. It seems that studying Buddhism is useless.

Now, we have understood that getting sick is due to our own karma, and no one can stop or stop karma.

Therefore, it cannot be said that if you study the Buddhist scriptures and recite the scriptures, you will be guaranteed not to get sick.

However, studying Buddhism and reciting sutras will eliminate karma and increase blessings. Yes, it is of great help in curing diseases.

Moreover, if you persist in studying Buddhism and reciting sutras, your karma will be eliminated, and your illness will be cured.

In addition, the state of mind when being reported is also very important.

In the process of receiving the reward, if the mentality is relatively peaceful and no troubles arise, the karma and obstacles will soon be eliminated.

On the contrary, if the time of receiving the retribution is difficult, if you feel resentment, or even get angry and lose your temper, the karma will become bigger and bigger, not only will it not be eliminated in this life, but it may also be brought to the next life, and the disease will not be cured.

73

Only by believing in cause and effect can we truly understand the cause.

In the process of learning Buddhism, in the process of generating bodhicitta, learning and cultivating the three ways, in the process of really starting to practice, even nightmares, headaches are all eliminating karmic obstacles. We must understand this, not talk about learning If you become a Buddha, you will not get sick. That is impossible, and it is also a misunderstanding of the Master, the Three Jewels, and the cause and effect.

(14) Laziness Laziness is laziness. Laziness is divided into two aspects: for good deeds, unwillingness to do it is a kind of laziness;

To be unwilling to put an end to evil is another kind of slack.

For example, for the good Dharma such as listening, thinking, and cultivating, you are unwilling to listen, think, and practice diligently;

For gluttony, sleepiness, waiting for bad things, but very longing, unwilling to stop.

To deal with slack, we must think more about the impermanence of life and the rare truth of being full of time.

Think about yourself: to get such a rare person, you can't waste your body, you have to be diligent.

If you keep thinking like this, you truly understand these principles, and after you have developed firm beliefs, you will naturally be diligent, and compulsive diligence is useless.

Yuecheng Bodhisattva said in "Entering the Middle Treatise":

74

When the situation is free, if you don't take the opportunity to save yourself

Falling into the abyss and losing freedom, who will save it then?

Therefore, while you have obtained a human body in leisure and haven't fallen into the evil realm, you should seize the time to save yourself and practice diligently.

(15) Laissez-faire is chaos, the mentality of not caring about anything.

For example, seeing someone very happy after a relapse, I am very eager and go, and I have the feeling, "Everyone else has relapsed, and I don't care.

"Yes, thinking, this kind of mentality is called letting go.

Because you don't care about anything, if you don't do the good things you should do, you won't be able to increase your good deeds and blessings.

Do not care about the afflictions and karma of the antidote, do not control it, and let words and deeds be driven by greed, hatred, and delusion.

Therefore, the Buddha believes that letting loose is the root of all afflictions.

It will gradually reduce the original merits of hearing, thinking, and cultivation, while greed, hatred, and delusion will increase day by day.

Laziness and laziness are also different. Laziness is because of laziness and inaction, laziness is driven by greed, hatred, and delusion.

By learning the San Shi Dao, after understanding the Dharma and cause and effect, it can effectively treat and relax.

75

Those who are particularly lethargic should take the initiative to educate them, and they should not be left alone and let them go in disorder.

For those who cannot convert to Buddhism temporarily, they can receive traditional education first, and then learn the Dharma.

(16) Drowsiness is a state of mind of wanting to sleep. 

When studying, there is not enough mental energy to keep the content of meditation clear and confused, which will hinder achievement.

In the process of studying and cultivating, when drowsiness occurs, think more about the merits of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas, and motivate yourself, and your mind will be clear.

If still, no, you can stand up, wash your face with cold water, or pinch yourself.

In order to prevent drowsiness, the masters of the Nyingma School in Tibet used to have a long braid. They hung the braid somewhere when they were chanting sutras.

When I studied with Dharma King Yongzeng, a young living Buddha also came to listen to Dharma King’s sermons with his master.

This master's father was very strict. When Dharma King Yongzeng was teaching the sutras, this master was sitting behind the living Buddha. When he saw the living Buddha was drowsy and was about to sleep, he immediately pinched him. Dharma King Yongzeng taught the scriptures for a long time, often for six or seven hours, and the master kept pinching himself, a disciple of the Living Buddha.

76

These are examples that we should learn from.

(17) Losing one's mind 

Losing one's mind is also called forgetting, which means to lose mindfulness, that is, forgetting and remembering good dharma.

For example, when meditating, but forgetting the teacher's teaching, it is a kind of forgetfulness.

The reason for the loss of mind is that the mind follows the delusion and loses it. Righteous thoughts.

Delusions are random thoughts caused by various troubles. If you don't pay attention to the treatment, the delusions will become more and more, and the memory and power will become more and more degraded.

For the good Dharma that has already been learned, it is necessary to review it frequently, especially, after listening to Master's lectures, it is necessary to review it immediately after going back. This will be easy and consolidated.

In peacetime, you should also pay attention to regularly practicing the good Dharma, so that you will not easily lose your mind when you study and cultivate.

Compared with drowsiness, the common denominator is the inability to clearly control the situation of good Dharma. When loss of mind occurs, the mind is very clear, but it is thinking about things;

When he is drowsy, he is delirious, confused, and doesn't know anything.

(18) Scattered thoughts

Distraction is a state of mind in which thoughts are scattered, delusional, swirling and never resting on the object of meditation.

A great reason for the occurrence of distraction is due to loss of mind, but there is still a difference between it and loss of mind.

Dispersion is due to the flying of delusional thoughts, and the thoughts begin to be scattered and scattered. Not only can they not clearly remember the situation just now, but also the thoughts are constantly changing, thinking about this all at once, thinking about that all of a sudden.

Loss of mind is not necessarily like this. Although the mind runs away, it may stop when thinking of something, it will not keep changing and running.

Our mind is constantly thinking about the external environment, and it will cause all kinds of distractions.

Especially the communication tools such as mobile phones of modern people have brought more chaos. Not to mention focusing on one thing, it is impossible to stay in one place quietly for a few minutes, because there are various All kinds of distracting thoughts, all kinds of troubles, plus, eating, drinking, playing, sleeping, can't settle down at all.

Serious distraction will not only make it impossible to practice meditation, but it will be very difficult to even study and think. This is what we need to pay attention to. Distraction is a big, very, and serious kind of affliction.

(19) To be swayed is to be unsettled, to be confused, and to run from east to west

Seven up and eight down.

Therefore, falling out is actually a kind of distraction, but it is different from distraction.

Abstinence generally refers to when one is meditating, one cannot settle down on the state of meditation, one’s mind is always distracted, and one recalls some beautiful and good things that happened in the past, which is a kind of greed;

And I can recognize that it should be added and deal with it, but my heart is still unable to contain it.

The scope of distraction is too broad, and the thoughts are constantly flying.

Nor do they think of dealing with them, because many people don’t even know about it, and distraction is also a kind of trouble.

When abjection occurs, think more about the three evil realms and the six realms of rebirth. The suffering will be greatly reduced, and the mind will slowly return to meditation.

(20) Non-right knowledge

non-right knowledge means that the way of thinking is very unclear when doing things, and the thinking is chaotic.

In the process of doing things, some people often do not know what they are doing. Such a state is called unrighteous knowledge.

When we do things, we must understand clearly, first of all, we must be clear about our thoughts, and then we must clearly know what we are doing, what we should not do, and what we should do.

When cultivating the Dharma, according to the ritual, first do the forward movement, awaken the Bodhisattva, raise the mind, then the right movement, and finally the end of the movement and devotion.

Every step is clear and clear, and the practice will be complete, and the purpose is also here.

79

A person often does not think, confused, memory will decline, the mind can easily get old.

In addition, when doing things, the mind is unclear, clear, and very casual. From the point of view of cause and effect, what karma is created, what results, and what results will inevitably lead to bad results.

The clergyman cultivates the countermeasures of karma, the purpose is to understand, cause and effect, cultivate good and break evil, and repent of karma.

The main point of the sergeant is to cut off troubles, think more about how to deal with all kinds of troubles, and pay close attention to dealing with them.

Master Bodova said: "When a person is young, his body is strong, his wisdom is strong, and his antidote is strong. After entering old age, his memory and antidote become worse and worse, but troubles do not grow old, so it is difficult to deal with them already."

(4) The source of afflictions 

The six root afflictions and all other afflictions are produced by bad gathering views and ego-clinging.

Different factions have different understandings, and there are some differences.

Consciousness-only schools believe that ignorance (here, not referring to the afflictions of ignorance) with the unclear nature of the five aggregates produces bad aggregate views, and bad aggregate views arise, all afflictions.

For example, when it was getting dark in the evening, I saw a bunch of rope and mistakenly thought it was a snake, which caused fear.

Here, the ignorance of the unclear nature of the five aggregates is equivalent to a rope that cannot be seen clearly, the bad gathering view is equivalent to the snake, and the fear caused by the snake is equivalent to the defilement caused by the bad gathering view.

80

The Madhyamika Yingcheng school believes that ignorance is bad gathering view, and bad gathering view is the root of affliction.

Bad gathering views are further divided into innate bad gathering views and separate bad gathering views. Among them, the "ego-clinging" in the innate bad gathering views is the real root of vexation.

So, what is "ego"? When we hear praise from others, we will think in our hearts: They are praising me, at this time, there seems to be a real "I" in our heart, because we have this feeling, we regard it as "I", and take it as an "I". craving for it.

When I feel wronged by others, I will think in my heart: They are wronging me. At this time, it seems that there is a real "I" in my heart who is being wronged. Because of this feeling, I have anger towards the person who harmed "I". hate.

This illusion of clinging to "I" is ego-clinging.

How does trouble arise? Once the self-interest and exclusion of others arises in the mind because of ego-attached relationships, afflictions arise.

The Dharma called Bodhisattva also said in the "The Theory of Compassion":

It is me that divides me and him, and love and hate arise from me and him, and because of this connection, all kinds of sins arise one after another.

That is to say, after the separation of ego attachments, there will be thoughts that I am different from others, which will then lead to the trouble of loving me and hating him, and other troubles will follow.

81

Therefore, the generation of afflictions originates from the clinging mind of ego.

In order to get rid of afflictions, we must get rid of ego-clinging.

Attachment to the present me is the ego-attachment, and the me mentioned here is the ego-attached me.

Now, each of us has not yet understood who the real me is, the me we have always thought, actually does not exist, there is a false me.

For example, if you ask someone, "Who do you say, who am I?" Some people will say that the body is me, some people will say that the mind is me, and some people will say that the eyes, ears, nose, tongue and body together are me.

After thinking about it carefully, you will understand that these are not actually me, these are "me".

We haven't realized the real me yet, and once we know the real me, the me who has broken the false appearance, will break the ego-clinging.

At this time, there will be no difference between me and him in my heart, and the root and source of the troubles will be removed, and naturally there will be no troubles.

We have already understood that bad gatherings and views generate greed, hatred, delusion, and other six root afflictions, and sentient beings create karma for this, and they circulate with karma.

It can be seen from this that bad gatherings of views and ignorance are born with self-clinging, which is the root and root of all afflictions.

Therefore, if you want to completely get rid of afflictions, you must get rid of the destructive accumulation of views, and ignorance is inherent in ego-clinging.

And only by understanding the wisdom of non-self, can we completely get rid of ego-clinging.

82

Before being able to use the wisdom of non-self to truly destroy the ignorance and ignorance of devastation, view, and self-clinging, try to prevent the arising of afflictions and reduce the karma caused by afflictions and afflictions.

This requires the ability to temporarily suppress the afflictions, insist on chanting sutras, reciting mantras, and learning and cultivating the three ways;

Diligently cultivate afflictions and treat them, such as cultivating compassion, forbearance, rejoicing, and so on.

(5) Causes and conditions of afflictions 

There are six kinds of causes and conditions of afflictions, including seeds of afflictions, conditions, influence of bad people, external teachings, habit of habitual afflictions, and thoughts, love and hatred.

The seeds of afflictions The seeds of afflictions are the root causes of afflictions. It can be said that the false self is the seeds of afflictions. This is the root cause, and it is the inner factor that arises and causes afflictions.
Our greed for money is for me, and our tantrums are for me, all for this false self.

As long as there is a seed, defilements will arise whenever the opportunity arises.

Defilement conditions Defilement conditions refer to the external factors that cause defilements.
83

It is stated in the Kosher:

The sleep is not interrupted, and he lives close to the environment again.

From unreasonable intentions, the troubles are full.

The predestined conditions of affliction originate from the three types of beauty, ugliness, and ordinary.

Because the seeds of affliction have not yet broken, seeing beautiful things will lead to greed, seeing ugly things will lead to hatred, and seeing ordinary things will lead to infatuation.

When the seeds of inner affliction meet the external conditions, afflictions arise.

For example, in a place where there is a feast for the eyes, it is easy to cause sexual immorality, etc., and relapse of precepts;

If you often attend parties, there will be drinking, anger, and even fighting.

It is all caused by the seeds of afflictions encountered, and after the predestined conditions, irrational intentions and random fabrications.

If you can't see the outside world, you can't have troubles.

Therefore, those who are new to Buddhism should keep a distance from bad external conditions, and then think about how to correct and cure them.

When the level of practice is a little better and the countermeasures are stronger, there is no need to deliberately stay away from the object of affliction.

Sometimes it even needs a specific predicament to deal with a certain kind of trouble.

The influence of bad people When interacting with bad people, it is easy to cause troubles under the influence of bad people.
84

The "bad guy" here refers to a bad friend.

Refers to those who will hinder our practice, not necessarily really bad people.

For example, people who like, eat and drink, talk about right and wrong, etc., are all bad friends.

The words and deeds of evil friends are easy to cause confusion, or make people reappear in the world, the blessings are less than the practice;

Or cause people to fall into troubles that could have been avoided, unable to extricate themselves, or even relapse.

Therefore, you must break up or stay away from bad friends.

At the very least, don't listen to them and do what they want.

What does external teaching mean? Listen to the voice of malaise, look down on things that are not good, and even the east and west of evil books and heresy, evil cults and evil methods.
Affected by these bad influences, it is easy to cause troubles.

For example, if you read books, movies, TV shows, etc. that contain pornography and killing, the more you read these things, the more greed, anger, and ignorance.

We should usually read more biographies of the great masters, cultivate more, and plant the seeds of liberation.

Seeing how the great virtues are diligently cultivating the Dharma will also inspire their diligence;

Seeing how the great virtues cultivated forbearance, I would also make progress in practicing forbearance.

The habit of learning troubles

The habit of affliction refers to the habitual psychology of obedience to afflictions formed from life to generation, and everyone has a lot of afflictions.

If the habit of affliction is not deliberately dealt with, but is smeared and used, and the habit and obedience to affliction are often strengthened intentionally or unintentionally, the habit of affliction will become more and more serious, and affliction will be more likely to arise. karma.

For example, if the behavior of greed is often neglected, and the habit of greed continues to grow, greed will flourish.

At this time, it is not necessarily necessary, if the object of greed appears, greed can also arise;

The object of anger generally refers to people or things that do not go according to one's wishes. However, some people who are angry and serious, even if the walking person glances at him and doesn't speak, he will be very angry and even make trouble. out of life.

Thinking of love and hatred often imaginatively strengthens love and hatred for a certain object of greed and hatred, and so on, and naturally it is easy to cause troubles.
For example, if you keep thinking about a piece of clothing that you like very much, how beautiful the color is, how high-grade the texture is, and how good the workmanship is, so that once the piece of clothing breaks, you will be very troubled.

For example, when you see someone you hate, if you keep thinking about how bad that person has done to you in the past, and whether it will be worse in the future, etc., you will hate the other person very much. Various troubles arose.

86

(6) The faults of afflictions 

We have already learned that afflictions are the main cause of the circulation of samsara, and the cause is extremely harmful.

Not only that, but even for the present world, troubles, and afflictions, there are serious faults.

It is stated in the "Jing Zhuang Lun":

Anxiety is bad, self-defeating, he breaks the pure precepts, retreats, loses, benefits, Dharma protector

Dou Zheng is notorious for his life, and he has no time in his life.

Having troubles will not only make oneself suffer in this life and the future, but also annoy others, destroy all the good roots and merits of oneself, and even break the precepts;

Not only will the karma that was beneficial to you in the past decline and lose, but you will also be scolded and reprimanded by your guru and Dharma protector, making it difficult for all kinds of merit to arise;

Not only in the present world will be ruined due to lawsuits, lawsuits, etc., but also in the future world will be reborn in a world without time;

Not only will there often be troubles, the trouble of gain and loss, but also cause greater sorrow.

All these boundless faults are caused by afflictions. Therefore, it is said in the Treatise on Entering Bodhisattva Actions:

All gods are not gods, and if they are enemies with me, they cannot make me fall into the endless fire.

87

This mighty force confuses the enemy and throws me at hell fire, and if Sumeru encounters him, he will not leave ashes.

If all the gods and asuras are our enemies, they can only hurt our flesh, but cannot break our hearts, so there is no way to send us into the endless hell.

However, not only can afflictions be easy, but they can also send us to hell. Even if Mount Sumeru encounters affliction fires, it will be burned to the point of not leaving ashes.

Therefore, afflictions are the most sinister, and the enemy should always be vigilant to deal with them. The Kadampa sages also said: "For afflictions, we should put on a fighting stance and try our best to fight them;

To all sentient beings, we should open our minds and try our best to benefit them. "

Second, karmic afflictions will lead to bad karma, renunciation of the following good intentions will create good karma, these two kinds of good and evil karma will bring sentient beings into samsara.

Concentrate, evil karma will fall into the evil realm, and thus experience a lot of suffering;

Good karma will feel, the fruit of men and gods, and get many happy feelings.

The good karma caused by renunciation as the origin, the result is liberation from samsara, return;

Good karma triggered by bodhicitta as the motivation, the result is Buddhahood.

88

The good deeds that are not based on renunciation and bodhicitta, the result is to obtain the fruit of human and heaven, or to be reborn in the pure land.

The karma created by greed is not necessarily bad karma. For example, greed, liberation, liberation, greed to be reborn in the Pure Land, diligently reciting Amitabha Buddha, making offerings to Buddha, etc., are good karma. However, karma created by greed must be bad karma.

3. Death 

(1) The predestined relationship of death is not the same for all living beings.

Some are caused by the exhaustion of life, some are caused by the exhaustion of blessings, and some are caused by obstacles.

There are many causes of human death, including death from illness, death due to disasters, death due to demonic obstacles, and so on.

(2) Triggers of karma 

When people are dying, they will remember the good and bad karma they have done in the past.

At the same time, the good and bad karma accumulated over the beginningless kalpa, including the good and bad karma accumulated in this life, will be triggered.

After passing away, they will be reborn with their karma, and they will circulate with their karma.

Among the countless good and bad karma accumulated, the one with the greatest karma is triggered first;

89

If the karma of good and evil is similar, the one with heavy habit will be triggered first;

If the size of the habit is similar, the one created first will be triggered.

When you are dying, if you have faith in your guru and the Three Jewels in your heart, it will trigger good karma.

Therefore, when dying, it is very important for the mind to clearly manifest and express good thoughts.

If you are a practitioner, when you are dying, most of them will think of good thoughts.

If anger and other afflictions arise, Dharma friends, we should remind him to be careful not to have troubles, and to recite the Buddha in our hearts, this is very important.

Some people have studied Buddhism all their lives and have cultivated very well, but when they die, they are very painful, and some even suffer from diseases such as cancer.

However, in the process of enduring pain and suffering, if you can't get rid of wrong views and confidence in the Three Jewels, if you retreat, your karma will be completely eliminated.

Because the karmic obstacles and sufferings are completely eliminated, the suffering will be exhausted before death, so 100% will be reborn in the Pure Land after death.

If it is a person who does evil, when he is dying, he will remember the bad things he did in the past, and he will regret it too much, and he will blame himself, and he will scratch his chest because of regret.

Others have developed a lot of hatred and hatred before they die, so they will definitely fall into the evil realm.

Some wicked people usually do bad things without regret. When they are dying, they hate themselves because of regret and die like this. This is a kind of magic, blessing.

Generally speaking, a peaceful demeanor at death is a good omen.

90

But some people create karma in their lifetime, but die very peacefully. It is very likely that they have exhausted their blessings in life and life. After the blessings are exhausted, only karma is left, so they will definitely go to hell after death.

(3) Precautions before and after death

 Before death, if someone recites sutras, such as the Diamond Sutra, the Heart Sutra, or the Buddha's name, these will be helpful.

However, when reciting and reciting sutras, one should pay attention to observation, so as not to annoy him.

Because when vexation arises, one may slander the Dharma, create bad karma, and instead plant the cause of falling into the evil realm.

After death, the body temperature of those who have been reborn in the good realm will move from the lower part of the body to the upper part of the heart, and the situation in the reborn in the evil realm is just the opposite.

If the person dies, the body temperature of the person gradually cools down from the upper part of the body, which is a manifestation of evil and the Way.

At this time, you can use the "Diamond Sutra" or "The Way of Bodhi, the Extensive Treatise on the Stages" to gently tap the top of the deceased's head three times, and he will not fall into the evil path.

In the past, there was a monk who broke the precepts in Labrang Monastery. When he died, his body temperature became cold from the upper part of his body, and he showed signs of falling into evil and Taoism.

Rako Rinpoche used "The Broad Treatise on the Stages of the Path of Bodhi", patted the top of his head, and his body temperature turned upside down, and he was reborn in a good path. The blessings of Dharma and power were truly incredible.

Therefore, if a person dies, he should immediately use the "Guangdong Theory on the Stages of the Path of Bodhi" or "Diamond Sutra" to knock three times on the top of the deceased's head, and then he can move his body, and don't move before he strikes.

In particular, the lower body must not be touched. If you touch it, the soul will go out of the anus or urine, and will fall into the evil realm in the next life.

The soul going out from the top door will be reborn in the Pure Land;

Go out from the eyebrows to meet, go to Heaven or Humanity;

Going out from the eyes and ears will be different, Tao.

The part you touch for the first time after dying is the one where the soul of the deceased goes out, so be careful.

In Tibetan areas, when a person is about to pass away, everyone is around to watch it. After confirming that he is determined to die, he immediately uses the "Guangdong Theory on the Stages of the Bodhi Path" to hit the deceased's head three times, and then move his body and put on his clothes.

You can't move until you knock. This is a very important cause for the deceased.

4. After a person in the bardo dies, they enter the bardo, also known as the yin body. 

Before reincarnating, they are all in the bardo state. At this time, they are called the middle and yin body. This state can last for the longest time. Forty-nine days.

(1) The state of the bardo

The body of the bardo body is as tall as a seven- or eight-year-old child, and it has all the five sense organs of the eyes, ears, nose, tongue and body.

92

The body is a light body of consciousness, not wisdom, a light body of wisdom.

There are five supernatural powers that can traverse obstacles.

Except for India, the Vajra seat where Bodhgaya Buddha attained enlightenment, or other Buddha statues with great blessings, as well as his own mother's womb, all of them can pass through without hindrance.

The bardo body to be reborn in the Pure Land is golden;

To go to the realm of heaven, the bardo body of the human realm is white;

Those who will fall into evil ways are gray;

It's black that's going to hell.

Walking posture is also different. To go to the bardo body of the heavenly way and the human way, walk like a normal person;

To be reborn in the Pure Land is to go up;

Those who want to go to hell are walking down on head and feet upside down.

The bardo body can see the body of the previous life, but the relationship with the body has been broken, and it is unwilling to return to the body.

When it comes to eating and drinking, the bardo body is like a sentient being who seeks incense, and when hungry, it can only be smelled.

Therefore, doing the kisai smoke offering can prevent the bardo body from suffering from hunger, and the blessing of wiping the saiyan sutra can also transcend the bardo body, which is of great help to the bardo body.

(2) The bardo body 

When you experience the bardo body, there is a lot of pain. When you think about where your body will go, you will not be able to settle down in one place, so you are always panicked.

93

According to the Tantra Root Tantra, there are six types of the bardo body, which are indeterminate:

Uncertain places, mountains and rivers live everywhere;

The location is uncertain, the roadside bridge tower is temporarily dependent;

Uncertain, doing all kinds of things in an instant;

Uncertain food, seeing the food of living beings in the six realms but not eating;

Friends are uncertain, temporarily gather with gods, ghosts, and all beings in the bardo body;

Unsettled mood, all kinds of joys and sorrows between moments.

Because of their own karma, what they see in the bardo body is also different and different.

You may see terrifying things, such as when you have created a life, bad karma, or bardo, you may see various animals chasing and biting, and you will be very scared.

The sound you hear is also more terrifying, and you will hear the sounds of the four great elements of the universe, that is, the sound of earth, water, fire, and wind.

Or at the end of the robbery, the sound of the explosion of the universe, the sound of the fire of the fire destroying all things in the universe, the sound of the wind, the sound of breaking the universe, the sound of the flood of cement and gravel washing the universe, etc., will feel very frightening.

However, for those who have great blessings or who did good deeds during their lifetime, when they enter the bardo, it is different. It is like entering heaven, and what they hear and see is wonderful.

94

(3) How to transcend the bardo body

 The state of the bardo body can only be maintained for seven to forty-nine days. First, the seven days are very important.

Because the first seven days are very easy and easy to overtake, and it is the easiest and most critical period to overtake.

In the first seven days, many bardo bodies will be reborn, and it will be very difficult to reincarnate in the good way after the rebirth.

Before rebirth, transcendence is relatively easy to reach the good path. It can be transcended by reciting sutras for the bardo body, or reciting the six-character mantra, the mantra of the immovable Tathagata, the holy name of Amitabha, etc. Transcendence requires three kinds of relationships to be useful. .

The first is to have a blood relationship with the deceased under seven generations. This kind of relationship can help the deceased greatly.

The second is the dharma relationship, such as the relationship between master and apprentice, and between teachers and brothers.

If there is a dharma relationship, it is more beneficial to recite the scriptures for transcendence.

The third is the property relationship, there is a common possession of property.

For example, after the death of relatives and friends, they use the jointly owned property to make offerings to temples, or make offerings to the mage, and ask the mage to help the deceased to escape, which can really help the deceased.

If there is no relationship, it is very difficult to help the deceased.

But if you have a big heart, you can help a little bit, but a normal heart can't help.

95

After death, if the first seven days cannot be reborn, the second, seven days may also find the mother to be reborn.

From the third to the seventh seven, heaven, the bardo body will definitely find the mother body to reincarnate.

Forty-nine days later, although I don't know where to go to the six realms, I can be sure that this bardo body has been reborn and is no longer in the bardo state.

(4) If you were a practitioner during your rebirth, you can see your own deity in the bardo body, and then follow the deity to be reborn in the Pure Land.

There are three situations to be reborn in the Pure Land: 

The first is to be reborn in the Pure Land of Dakinis, which is the most extraordinary method of rebirth in the Pure Land of Tantra. 

It can bring the physical body to rebirth. There are many such great achievers in history.

The second is that without passing through the bardo body, as soon as the body dies, the spirit and soul come out of the body and go directly to the Pure Land.

The third type is when you are in the bardo body, you can see the deity you cultivated in your life.

If the deity is Amitabha, you can see Amitabha in the bardo body, and then follow Amitabha to be reborn in the Western Pure Land.

If the deity is Tara, you can see Tara, and then follow her, and Tara will be reborn in the Pure Land.

When ordinary people die, they all go through the bardo body.

When you are in the bardo, you may see terrifying things, hear terrifying sounds, and feel terrifying and terrifying.

96

At this time, if you can think of your own deity, the deity, it will definitely appear, and you can be reborn in the Pure Land by following the deity.

After death, sentient beings do not necessarily have to go through the bardo stage.

There are also practitioners who are directly reborn in the Pure Land;

There are also people who committed great evils and went straight to hell during their lifetime.

There are also those who have been reborn in the Formless Realm, and these do not need to go through, the bardo body.

5. Living beings have four births:

 womb birth, egg birth, wet birth, and transformation birth.

Humanity is womb, heaven and hell are metamorphosis, birds, etc.

Animals are oviparous, and many small life forms such as bacteria are wet.

All living beings are born out of troubles.

Viviparous and oviparous beings see their parents when they are in the bardo

In intercourse, if you covet your mother, you will be reborn as a man, and if you covet your father, you will be reborn as a woman.

Dampness is born of greed for smell;

Metamorphosis is born from greed for abode, for example, hot hell is born from craving for warmth, and cold hell is born from craving for cold.

97

The third section of the truth 

1. In general, the real method of liberation is to cultivate the Dharma. The cultivation of the Dharma is divided into five stages and stages, and there are five paths: the path of accumulation, the path of addition, the path of seeing, the path of cultivation, and the path of learning.

(1) In order to achieve liberation, it is necessary to accumulate a lot of resources and blessings. 

This stage is called the path of resources.

There are three kinds of material ways: 

high-grade material road, 

middle-grade material road, 

and low-grade material road.

Once you get the renunciation, you will achieve the path of inferior resources;

Continue to practice, get meditation, and enter the path of middle-grade resources;

Continue to practice, begin to realize, part of emptiness, and realize that part of people have no self. At this time, it is the highest, the way of quality food.

The Dharma of Accumulation is the first Dharma. At this time, practitioners have already started, and they have magical powers and some abilities.

How to cultivate the way of resources? In other words, it is the practice of the four mindfulness.

Four Mindfulness

Mindfulness is a kind of wisdom that understands not-self;

Abiding is a kind of meditation. Not only do you need to understand that people have no ego, but you also need to be able to settle down in the state of no ego. Come, you will gain mindfulness.

The four mindfulness refers to mindfulness of body, mindfulness of feeling, mindfulness of mind, and mindfulness of Dharma.

To deal with the six root afflictions, one needs to cultivate the four mindfulness-based meditations.

(1) Mindfulness of the body

 Mindfulness of the body is to contemplate the impurity of the body.

The purpose is to combat greed, and not to be greedy for color, sound, smell, taste, touch, and Dharma.

Those who are greedy need to cultivate themselves with mindfulness.

For example, if you are too greedy for someone and suffer, you can deal with it through self-cultivation and mindfulness.

First, visualize a Sanskrit word "ah" (ah) on the forehead of the object of craving, and then visualize "ah". The word slowly turns into a bubble, which is a big pimple, and then visualize the pimple. A lot of pimples grew out of it, and finally, visualize, the face of the craving object is full of pimples.

At this time, see that you are still greedy, not greedy, and if you are still greedy, then visualize that your whole body is full of pimples.

If you are still greedy, visualize your whole body rotting.

In this way, with this kind of visualization, the Dharma door is used to combat greed.

In the past, there was a king in India. He loved a concubine very much, and he was never away from this concubine.

Once, to go to war, I had to leave Concubine Ai at home.

99

The day after he left, Ai, the concubine died, and the courtiers were very afraid, worried that they would not be able to explain to the king.

A wise minister said: "I have a solution, we will send a letter to the king tomorrow, and first tell the king that there is a pimple on the forehead of the concubine Ai.

After seeing the letter, the king was very worried: "Oh, ah, there is a pimple on Concubine Ai's head. If it wasn't for the war, I would definitely go back to see her." "A few days later, another messenger came, and the king asked, "How is Concubine Ai? The person who reported the letter said, "Concubine Ai has a lot of acne on her head. "The king was very surprised when he heard this.

The next time, the reporter said: "Your beloved concubine now has pimples all over her face.

"The king felt that his concubine was helpless.

When I reported the letter again, the messenger said, "Now I have acne all over my body.

Then the king thought, "I don't want to see her anymore."

"In this way, it is broken step by step, the king's greed.

If he had just started reporting truthfully, the king would have been very angry, and he might have killed the left-behind ministers and those who took care of his beloved concubine. The king's greed would be cut off, and everyone would be at peace with each other.

If you are too greedy for a certain opposite sex or child, you can use this method to deal with it.

Or visualize the earth, all sentient beings have become white bones;

Or think that the sentient beings greed are their own debts, Lord;

Or contemplate the dangers of greed. For example, the greed of money, because the intention is greed, so making money is also the cause of evil.

Only the money that is not greedy is the real wealth.

These methods will make people slowly and cut off their greed.

(2) Feeling mindfulness 

Feeling mindfulness is contemplating feeling as suffering.

It is necessary to understand the various feelings of the six faculties. The feelings are actually the suffering of actions. Sentient beings cannot control these feelings, and the feeling of happiness will soon become suffering.

The practice of contemplation on feeling is suffering is correct, and it cures various delusions about pleasant feeling.

You should also pay attention to balancing the various pains and pleasures.

When you are happy, don't be greedy, and understand that happiness is only temporary;

Don't complain when you suffer, accept it willingly, or see it as eliminating karma, and suffering is also temporary.

Feelings of suffering and happiness should be treated peacefully. For example, if you are so peaceful that everything you see is happy, and there is no pain at all, you will see that everyone is a good person, everything is a good thing, and there are scenery everywhere.

(3) Mindfulness 

Mindfulness is observing the impermanence of mind.

We must understand that our six senses, eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, and mind, have been changing rapidly, arising and passing away, and have never stopped.

101

The reason for cultivating mindfulness is that all living beings are attached to one constant in the world, my mind.

This is an inversion.

The mind is fickle, and not eternal.

It takes decades for our body to slow down and grow old slowly, but we don’t know how much the mind changes for one second. No, the changed self does not exist, so the Buddha taught us to observe, the mind is impermanent, not to Perseverance.

(4) Dharma mindfulness 

Dharma mindfulness is the contemplation of Dharma without self.

The purpose is to get rid of the attachment to the ego, the attachment to the law, the attachment to the ego and the law is the most difficult to break, and it must rely on the wisdom of emptiness.

The practice of the four mindfulness must begin with contemplating the impurity of the body, then contemplation of feelings, suffering, impermanence of mind, and finally contemplation of dharma without self.

Because the activities of the body are the most gross, the feelings are more subtle, and the mind is more subtle, and the Dharma is the most subtle, and it can only be eliminated by practicing in order.

(2) After completing the Accomplishment Path, one enters the Path of Accomplishment. At this time, there is already the possibility of realizing emptiness.

add line means move forward

It is the way forward before the realization of emptiness in the present, preparation and preparation for the realization of emptiness in the present.

There are four levels of additional lanes:

Warming the ground is like drilling wood to make a fire. Everyone knows that before the fire starts, it must reach a certain temperature.
Warm ground means that, in order to ignite the fire of realizing emptiness in the present, it is necessary to first reach the temperature of proportion and realization of emptiness.

Top to bottom is the most extraordinary state of merit in the world.

Endurance begins with endure, and the fear of emptiness is eliminated.

Forbearance, before, after practicing meditation and realizing that people have no self, some people will be afraid and enter emptiness.

Worrying that after entering emptiness, all dharmas will be empty and oneself and one’s body will be gone, so I am more afraid. After entering the land of forbearance, I will no longer be afraid.

Master Xirao Sangge is the successor of Master Tsongkhapa's tantric teachings. The chief disciple, once, when Master Tsongkhapa talked about emptiness, Xirao, Master Sangka realized emptiness by a certain amount.

At this time, he was very frightened and grabbed the collar of the cassock tightly. Master Tsongkhapa saw it and said, "No, don't be afraid, you put the collar in the mundane truth, and your me is here." After listening to this sentence Only then did Master Xirao Sengge calm down.

When practitioners realize emptiness, they can be divided into two situations.

In the past, people who have never practiced emptiness, or have never heard of emptiness, would be very frightened once they enter emptiness and do not know what to do.

But this kind of thing is only a few minutes, the longest is about an hour, and a lot of karma will be eliminated during this time.

Then there will be no fear, and will understand: I have now entered emptiness, which is the state of emptiness;

The other is the person who has practiced the emptiness method in the previous life. Because there are seeds of emptiness in the past, they are not afraid. When they enter emptiness, they will be very happy, very happy, just like the treasure that was lost before when they found themselves again.

The first place in the world is also known as the Way of Victory and Accomplishment. It is the most extraordinary of the Way of Accomplishment. Cultivation, when you reach this level, you can enter the Way of Seeing in an instant.
From the time of entering the Jiaxing Road, the achievement of practice has been very, high.

At this time, the practitioner's body will be very clean, there will be no dirt, and he will practice even in his sleep.

During the middle-grade material road, there are times when I practice in the dream, and when the high-grade material road is in the dream, most of the time is practiced.

From the moment he entered the Kagyu path, he has been cultivating in his dreams.

Beginning with the Way of Addition, if you want to do the Dharma to increase interest and increase your heart, you can do it without reciting rituals or holding pujas.

For example, when you see where the fire is, as long as you make a wish in your heart: May the fire go out.

Willingness will put out the fire.

Earthquakes and plagues occur, and these disasters can be terminated with the practitioner's wishes.

The merit and ability of the way of adding practice is already great, and it is difficult for ordinary people to imagine the merits of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas.

Someone once asked when Master Bodova was teaching the Dharma, what are the merits of Buddhas, what are the merits of Bodhisattvas who practice the Way, and what are the merits of Shravakas who practice the Way?

Boduo, Master Wa replied, I am now talking about the merits of the Bodhisattva of the Jiaxingdao. If I talk about the merits of the Shravaka, everyone will think it is impossible, thinking, and they will think that entering the Jiaxingdao means becoming a Buddha. There is a difference between the merits of Jiaxingdao and the merits of Buddhas.

(3) After seeing the Dharma and practicing the Dharma, and continuing to practice, one enters the Seeing Dharma.

When he entered the position of seeing the Dharma, he had already realized emptiness.

105

At this time, if it is a Bodhisattva of Mahayana, it will break the barrier of discernment and knowledge;

In Theravada, the Shravaka and the Arhats will break the vexation barrier, which is to separate afflictions.

Distinguishing afflictions are those that we can remember in this life and this life. Annoyances, such as hatred, are not caused by past lives, but are caused by enemies and enemies in this life. They are afflictions and afflictions that arise in this life. These kinds of afflictions are It is called the affliction of separation. After entering the position of seeing the Way, these afflictions of separation will be cut off in an instant.

When a person is first born, he is relatively quiet, because there are fewer worries about separation.

But before birth, troubles began in the womb.

In the last three or seven days of the fetus, the fetus can feel that the mother's fetus is very smelly, and it will produce a kind of disgust. If it wants to escape, it will start to worry.

But at this time, the troubles were not big. After birth, I gradually came into contact with the outside world, and I had various feelings, and all kinds of different troubles followed.

Another kind of affliction is called innate affliction. The innate affliction is me. The afflictions that we have brought in the rebirth of life after life, the afflictions of innate affliction are not, so easy to break.

After the Hinayana practice reaches the position of seeing the Dharma, and after entering the meditation of emptiness, it will cut off all the afflictions of separation, and leave the meditation after a day or two.

After leaving the concentration, if you continue to enter the concentration of emptiness, you will not see the Dao level, but you will enter the Dao level.

(4) When cultivating the Dao and cultivating the Dao position, continue to cultivate emptiness. At this time, it is the co-birth and afflictions that must be cut off.

Practitioners must also enter at least nine times of emptiness, because we have nine innate afflictions: three large, medium and small, each of which is divided into nine.

When you cut off each affliction, you must enter the meditation of emptiness once. Once you enter the samādhi, you will cut off all the afflictions.

First, the great innate afflictions must be cut off, the biggest afflictions must be cut off first, then the samādhi should be cut off, and then the smallest innate afflictions should be cut off in turn.

The smallest afflictions are the most subtle afflictions, the seeds of afflictions. Generally, one cannot recognize them. If one does not think that it is a kind of affliction, when the seeds and seeds are cut off, all afflictions will be cut off.

Once all the afflictions are cut off, they will be liberated and become an Arhat, and then they will enter the path of non-learning.

(5) Unlearned Theravada Arhats who are liberated are called the Unlearned Dao, because from the perspective of eliminating afflictions and afflictions, it is no longer necessary to continue studying at this level.

But from the perspective of the Mahayana eradicating the barriers to knowledge, there is actually a way to learn, and one needs to learn it.

Only after attaining Buddhahood is the true path of non-learning. At this time, both from the perspective of cutting off afflictions and from the perspective of cutting off obscurations, there is no need for learning, and there is really no need to learn.

107

After all the obstacles of vexation and knowledge are cut off, from the perspective of accumulating blessings, in terms of degrees, the blessings are complete;

From the perspective of wisdom, wisdom is round and full;

In terms of ability, ability is complete.

This is the unlearned way of Mahayana, and the unlearned way of Mahayana is the real unlearned way.

2. The Twelve Dependent Origination is in the zhongshi part. We have already understood that in the six realms of sentient beings, every sentient being has immeasurable and boundless suffering.

Wherever you are born is suffering, whatever you live with is suffering, and whoever you are with is suffering.

The root of suffering is the affliction of ignorance. If you want to get rid of suffering, you must cut off the affliction. Once the affliction is cut off, the affliction will be liberated.

So, how can we stop worrying? To be repaired, Dao.

By practising the Twelve Dependent Origination or Precepts, Concentration and Wisdom, liberation from suffering.

The Hinayana liberation path includes conditioned awareness and shravaka. Among them, conditioned and jue Arhat mainly practice the twelve Dependent Origination Laws to achieve liberation.

The twelve dependent arisings are: ignorance, formation, consciousness, name and form, six senses, contact, feeling, craving, grasping, existence, birth, old age and death.

The originless troubles of sentient beings in the past are called "ignorance".

Including, I law enforcement and law enforcement.

The kamma that arises from ignorance is called "action".

The consciousness that has just entered the womb, the consciousness gas is consciousness, which arises from ignorance, action, and the past.

Also called divine consciousness, the consciousness at this time is the consciousness defiled by good and evil karma.

After consciousness enters the womb, in the first seven days, the five aggregates are gradually formed, and the state at this time is called "name and form".

The fetus has the six sense organs and is about to be born. At this time, the state is the "six penetrations".

Contact with foreign objects after birth is "touch".

The six faculties of eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind, and the six senses of eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and consciousness, are in contact with the six senses of form, sound, smell, taste, touch, and Dharma. environment, the reaction produced by the combination of the three is "touch".

For example, the combination of eye and eye-consciousness and external objects generates color, the combination of ear and ear-consciousness, air vibration, movement generates sound, the combination of nose and nose-consciousness, the combination of external odor generates fragrance, the combination of tongue and tongue-consciousness, food generates flavor, etc.

The feeling of "touch" is "feeling".

For example, after the eye and eye-consciousness come into contact with the external world, the feelings of liking, disgust, and feeling that arise are "feelings".

In the "feeling", there is a sense of distinction. As long as the feeling is pleasant, not painful, the process of this pursuit is "love".

Because there is "love", there is a desire for greed, only pursuing what you like.

After a child is born, he has gradually developed a little bit of "love". He will pursue and ask for what he likes, and push aside what he doesn't like. This kind of choice with different thoughts is "taking".

Because there is a mind of discrimination and attachment, a lot of karma will be created in the process of "taking", so "taking" is also the beginning of the cause in this world.

In the process of "taking", many afflictions arise, and because of afflictions they are created again. When karma is acquired, it is called "existence", and "existence" is karma.

Because of "existence", the karma increases, and the karma is continuously created, and the karma and the obscurity further increase until death.

After death, due to karmic reasons, rebirth in the six realms is called "birth".

After "birth", it grows old again until death, which is "old age and death".

The Twelve Dependent Origins talks about the rebirth of the three worlds.

"Ignorance and formation" are the samsara of the previous world, "consciousness, name and form, six senses, contact, feeling, craving, grasping, existence, birth, old age and death" are the samsara of this life, and "birth, old age and death" are again, yes The rebirth of the afterlife.

"Xing" is the karma that leads to the rebirth of the previous life, and "there" is the karma that leads to the rebirth of the future life.

The Twelve Dependent Origination is one of the whole process of a person coming into the world to be born to old age and death. The above method starts from ignorance and affliction.

Let’s go against the trend and think about it again, starting from “old age and death”: why people “age and die” is because of “birth”;

Also, why is there "birth", because the karma is created, that is, "there";

The reason why karma is created is because of the pursuit of pleasure, that is, "taking";

Why do you pursue pleasure? It is because the idea of ​​discrimination arises, that is, "love";

The reason why discriminatory thinking arises is because there is a feeling of pain and pleasure, which is "feeling";

Why there is feeling, because there is "touch";

Why there is "touch"? It's because the "six senses" combined with the six senses encountered the six realms, resulting in "touch";

Why there are "six entrances", it is because "name and form" grow into the womb;

The reason why there is "name and form" is because there is a stained, stained soul that has entered the womb, and this stained soul is "consciousness";

Then, where does "consciousness" come from, because "actions" create goodness, and evil karma defiles this "consciousness";

Where does the "action" come from? It's the ignorance and afflictions that create the karma, and this karma is the "action".

Therefore, the root of the six realms of samsara is the afflictions of ignorance. Once the afflictions of ignorance are cut off, you will never be reborn in samsara again, and you will be liberated.

In this way, think about the twelve Dependent Origination according to the forward and reverse, and then you will understand the process of a person's circulation in samsara;

Contrasting, thinking, you can find the source of samsara, which is the affliction of ignorance.

Of the twelve dependent arisings, three are afflictions, two are karma, and seven are suffering.

The three defilements are: ignorance, craving, and clinging.

The two karmas are: doing, and having.

The seven sufferings are: consciousness, name and form, six sense organs, contact, feeling, birth, old age and death.

111

Now everyone understands why you need to be liberated, because the pain of samsara and rebirth is too much! Opportunities for liberation are very rare compared to suffering.

In countless rebirths, we only know that this opportunity in front of us will have a chance in future generations, and we cannot be sure.

Therefore, we must cherish it. If we miss this opportunity and fail to be liberated, we will re-enter rebirth, continue to be born, continue to suffer, and the hope of liberation is very slim.

3. In addition to meditating on the Four Noble Truths, the Twelve Condition, and Origination, there is another method for practicing morality, concentration and wisdom.

When we talk about cultivation, we are mainly talking about the cultivation of precepts, concentration and wisdom.

(1) Discipline

The Importance of Purity of Precepts (1) The Purity of Precepts and Virtues Purity of Precepts is very important.
We already know that karma arises due to afflictions. If we can purify and uphold the precepts, we will naturally cut off a large part of afflictions, and we will also cut off a lot of the possibility and ability to create karma.

For example, the five precepts, do not kill, do not steal, do not commit sexual misconduct, no, lie, and do not drink alcohol. If these five precepts can be purified, they will be broken. The troubles caused by these evil karma will not lead to greater karma. Great fortune.

Now is the era of conflict, if you can keep the precepts clean, you will be blessed and rewarded very much.

In the Age of Perfection or in the Land of Ultimate Bliss, the merits of a pure bhikkhu who keep two hundred and fifty-three precepts in his life are compared with the merits and virtues of the current Saha world, the merits of the latter, who are pure and abide by one precept. The good news is bigger.

The Ten Wheels Sutra says:

Who, during the years of the Hengsha Kalpa, made offerings to hundreds of millions of Buddhas with a pious heart with food, drink, garland, and bright lamps;

Whoever observes a good precept day and night when the good Dharma is destroyed and the holy religion is on the verge of perishing, the latter's merits and virtues are even more extraordinary.

That is to say, if a person makes offerings, such as food, umbrellas, banners, lamps, etc., to the Buddhas and Tathagatas devoutly during the ages of kalpas as many as the number of sands in the Ganges, this kind of merit must be very, great.

But there is a kind of merit that is even greater than this, that is, in the era of the end of the Dharma when the Buddhist Dharma is destroyed, if you keep a single precept day and night, your blessings will exceed the former.

113

At the end of the Dharma period, if someone can really practice hard and become liberated, he will be very fast, and he will become a Buddha very fast.

Because liberation is achieved during this period, there are many causes and conditions for liberation, and it is relatively easy to accumulate blessings.

Every stimuli from the outside world, every affliction of oneself, every encounter, and debtor, if one can deal with it with bodhicitta, it is an opportunity to accumulate blessings and eliminate karmic obstacles.

The bodhisattvas in the Land of Ultimate Bliss saw this, so they vowed to be reborn in our southern Zhanbu continent.

(2) Purity of precepts is the foundation of all merits. Nagarjuna Bodhisattva said in the Book of Relatives and Friends:

Precepts are like the moving and still earth, which is the foundation of all merits.

Precepts are the root of all merits. Precepts are like the earth, and merit and achievement are like all things growing on the earth. Without the earth, there would be nothing.

When the precepts are purified, meditation will naturally be obtained.

Among the precepts of body, speech, and mind, when the precepts of the body are purified, the body will not create karma, no, it will be disordered;

The precepts of the mouth have been purified, and they will not speak right and wrong, speak or lie, and will not stoke the karma of the mouth;

When the precepts of mind are purified, greed, hatred, delusion, arrogance, doubt, and jealousy will naturally decrease.

When the vexation is reduced, it is even more easy to generate the merits of meditation.

The gate of sin of sin The gate of sin of sin refers to the four factors that lead to sin of sin.
Don't be ignorant, disrespectful, lethargic, and troubled.

(1) Ignorance and ignorance will lead to many mistakes.

To read and study more, at least understand the Five Precepts, Bodhisattva Precepts, and Tantric Precepts.

If you don't study and understand a lot, you will make a lot of mistakes.

For example, those who have received the empowerment of the Supreme Yoga Department should do it at least every day, and go to the six yogas. The six yogas are all precepts and should be recited seriously.

Also think about whether you have broken the precept, and if you do, you must immediately repent.

If you don't understand these things, and you don't do the six yogas every day, you will not only lose money, but also make a lot of trouble, and the retribution will be very heavy.

(2) If you disrespect or respect the precepts you take, it is easy to break the precepts.

If you have a respectful heart for the precepts that you or others take, it is easy to purify the precepts.

115

An important reason why a pure bhikkhu does not pay homage to outsiders, ghosts and gods is to respect his own precepts, not because of arrogance.

Among bhikkhus, those who have been ordained for a short period of time should respect those who have been ordained for a long time, as well as those who have respected others.

Also, being disrespectful is an annoyance.

(3) Letting go has been discussed in the previous Twenty Supplementary Defilements, so I won't talk about it here.

(4) Many afflictions If there are too many afflictions such as greed, hatred, and delusion, it is easy to break the precepts.

(2) Meditation When meditating, four conditions need to be met.

The first is to understand how to practice meditation.

The second is to have a clean environment.

Preferably, on a mountain, or in a temple.

Some temples are close to the downtown area, so they are not suitable for meditation.

It is very important to choose a place to meditate. Even in a high-rise building in the center of the city, as long as you can't hear the sound outside and no one disturbs you, it's okay.

The third is to stay away from chores.

Can not watch TV, computer, can not use mobile phones, telephones, do not receive information from the outside world.

Because the mind will be disturbed by these messages, so meditation will not be successful.

The fourth is to have adequate living conditions.

You must have enough food, clothing, etc., you must prepare food for a year, and you must have a toilet, a bathroom, and you must be able to take a bath. If the meditation of the deity of the monks, you must take a bath once or twice a day, and your body must be very strong. clean.

The location of meditation (1) Selection of the location When practising meditation, you must first select a location and determine the location before you can practice meditation.
What is the fixed place? Essentially, anything can be regarded as a fixed place.

In the past, high-level outsiders all had meditation. When they practiced meditation, they either chose leaves as their meditation sites, or they used branches, stones, etc. as their meditation sites.

If you use these for concentration, you can get concentration, but this kind of concentration is not good for you.

We also have to choose a concentration, and what can we use to do it so that we can not only get meditation, but also increase the blessings? We choose Buddhas and Bodhisattvas as the center.

117

It is best to be Shakyamuni Buddha, or Master Tsongkhapa, or his own deity.

(2) It is wrong to make sure that concentration meditation is practiced with consciousness, not with eye-consciousness. Some people use it, look at a certain place with their eyes, and visualize the Buddha there. This is wrong.

, use consciousness to visualize, use eye-consciousness will not achieve meditation.

Once you have chosen the concentration, you can practice focusing the mind on the concentration.

If the chosen location is Shakyamuni Buddha, then it will be fixed on the Buddha.

The highest Buddha visualized cannot exceed one inch, and the smallest is the size of a grain of rice. The smaller the location, the better. The smaller the location, the easier it is to concentrate the mind, and the mind is easier to settle down. Therefore, it is best to be as large as a pea or a grain of rice. .

When you visualize Buddha Shakyamuni, you can visualize the Buddha in front of you, on your face, on the top of your head, in your heart, or on the tip of your nose.

Visualize the tip of the nose, there is a bright spot on it, which is a small light, and visualize in the halo, Buddha.

The Buddha visualized should be alive, with flesh and blood, with moving eyes, mouth, and jaw, and a smiling face, not a clay or bronze statue.

First of all, we must grasp the whole of the Buddha's body. The Shakyamuni Buddha to be visualized is the one we often see: one face and two arms, sitting in a cross-legged position;

The body is golden-yellow, with the right hand stamped on the ground, and the left hand holding the bowl, which is filled with nectar.

When practising meditation, the Buddha must be in a sitting posture, so that Dependent Origination will be better. Although visualizing a standing Buddha, there are also blessings, but the Dependent Origination of meditation is not so good.

After visualizing the outline of the Buddha's body clearly, visualize each part.

First visualize the head, eyes, and eyebrows. The black and white of the eyes should be visualized clearly.

On this basis, visualize the mouth again, notice that the mouth is red, red, while visualizing the mouth, don't forget the eyes, and more importantly, don't forget the outline of the body.

Then, add the entire face, nose, hair, entire head, ears, all very clearly.

It will be blurry at first, but slowly you will have to visualize it very, very clearly, like looking at your own face in a mirror.

If the face and body can be visualized clearly, it will be easier to visualize the body.

On the basis of visualizing the Buddha's head clearly, add the Buddha's chest, the part above the mouth, and the two arms.

Then slowly visualize the abdomen, body, and legs clearly.

At this time, the Buddha's whole body has been visualized very clearly.

Then visualize the 100,000 pores on the Buddha's body, including the pores of the hair, and visualize clearly.

After meditating in this way for a period of time, usually about a month.

If the sitting posture, size, color, brightness, etc. of the Buddha in the fixed position can remain unchanged for at least seven days, the fixed position can be determined, and here it is.

From now on, do not adjust the changes, including sitting posture, size, color, brightness, etc., do not change again.

119

After the meditation and breathing have determined the location, you must choose your own sitting posture.
The best thing is to be able to sit on the knees, but it is not necessary to sit on the knees. Everyone's roots are different, and they can sit in half-protuberance, growth, or sideways.

When the Buddha was alive, there was an Arhat named Niu Tuo. When he practiced meditation, he practiced by sitting in a cross-section, but he failed to achieve it. He practiced in the growth seat, lotus seat, etc., and posture, but he failed to achieve it.

Later, Buddha Shakyamuni said to him, "You are reborn from an ox. You can only meditate in the ox posture. That's it." bit.

The common way to sit is to sit cross-legged. The hands are in Ding Yin, the left hand is down, the right hand is up, the tongue is on the upper jaw, the eyes are 80% closed, and the tip of the nose may not be seen.

The head is slightly tucked, the shoulders are stretched back, and the body should be straight.

When the body is straight, the pulse in the body is straight, and the qi that travels in the pulse is straight. When the qi is straight, the heart that follows the qi can be easily subdued.

Sitting in a cross position can also remove the obstacles of demons and ghosts.

Demons and ghosts can't stand this way of sitting, and they will be a few hundred meters away from the person who is meditating.

Because of this, this sitting method is the sitting method of Vairocana Buddha, so it is called the seven branches of Vairocana, and it is also called the seven methods of Vairocana.

Vairocana Buddha once made a vow: "After I become Buddha Shakyamuni Buddha Shakyamuni Buddha, if someone meditates using the seven methods of Vairocana, the obstacles of demons, ghosts, non-human beings will not succeed."

Shakyamuni Buddha

So, meditate with the seven methods of Vairocana, and ghosts and demons will run away.

If you see something abnormal or evil, you can also get rid of it by meditating on the horse and using the Seven Ways of Vairocana.

After sitting in a cross position, the next step is to adjust your breathing.

Before practicing meditation, first, let the mind settle down through breathing. The specific method is: first, inhale through the left nostril and exhale through the right nostril, a total of three times;

Then, inhale through the right nostril and exhale through the left nostril, three times in total;

Breathe three more times through the left and right nostrils and holes at the same time.

At the same time as breathing, the mind is fixed on the breath, and the mind follows the breath. In this way, when you breathe nine or twenty-one times, the mind will be settled.

The Seven Dharmas of Vairocana plus breathing are often referred to as the Eight Vairocanas.

Once the mind's processing mind during meditation is settled, you can visualize the Buddha in the place of meditation.
When contemplating samādhi, there will be two situations in the mind, which are also the two major obstacles to the practice and practice of samādhi: slackness and drowsiness.

Falling out is that the mind is not in the fixed place and has gone outside.

Drowsiness is divided into coarse and fine, coarse drowsiness is the state of feeling heavy and wanting to sleep;

Or when contemplating the samādhi, it is not very clear, vague, or vague.

Subtle drowsiness means that although the mind is completely fixed on the concentration, the Buddha's brightness and spirit in the concentration are weakened.

After the mind is settled, the main consciousness of the mind cannot be too tight. Too tight will cause the mind to fall off, the mind will be scattered and run away;

It should not be too loose. If it is too loose, it will cause drowsiness and drowsiness.

When the main consciousness of the mind is fixed on the samādhi, use another, the citta, that is, the subordinate consciousness of the heart (for example, when driving, the main consciousness is driving, and the subordinate consciousness is chatting) to observe the main consciousness and see the main consciousness. Whether the consciousness is fixed on the fixed place, and is in a state of not being tight or loose, is it too loose or too tight?

If it is found that the main consciousness is not fixed in the place of concentration, that is, it has occurred, and the mind must be pulled back with the consciousness of the subordinate branches, and it will be re-centered on the place of concentration.

If the drop is serious, and you pull it back and run again, you can't hold it back. At this time, you can stand up and recite the scriptures, worship Buddha, read a book, and then meditate.

If the main consciousness is fixed on the fixed position, but the body feels heavy and wants to sleep;

Or if the Buddha's visualization of the meditation is not clear, this is the occurrence of drowsiness, and the mind should be tightened a little until the mind is very relaxed, and the meditation is also very clear and bright.

If you really can't do it, you can get up, take a walk, recite sutras and worship Buddha, or wash your face, take a bath, and then meditate.

Taking a bath when drowsiness occurs is a very important method.

123

It should be noted that the Buddha that you visualize must be very clear, no, vague, otherwise, people will become stupid after a long time.

When you first start practicing meditation, the time should not be too long.

When the mind is not disturbed, it is very, very wrong to be able to settle for five minutes in a fixed place.

After five minutes, if your mind is unsteady, don't force it. You can stand up, do a few prostrations, or burn incense, recite sutras, take a walk, and come back to meditate when you want to meditate.

In this way, the effort of meditation and concentration will gradually increase, and the time to settle at the place of meditation will also be gradually extended. When the mind can be calm for half an hour, if you persist, you will be able to meditate for two hours or half a day. , and then it will be fixed soon, one day.

To the extent that one can contemplate one day, it is very easy to enter the seven days of contemplation.

When you can stay in meditation for a few days, meditation will be successful.

After the meditation has been successfully cultivated, the meditation can be released by making a vow.
For example, if you want to get out of meditation at sunset, you make a vow: "I will meditate all day today, until the sun goes down.

"If you make a vow in this way, you will definitely get out of samadhi at sunset, and you won't get out of samadhi before sunset;

If you make a wish to meditate for a month, you will definitely stay in the meditation for a month, and the meditation will be released after a month.

The back mountain of Ganden Monastery is called Amdo Ri Mountain (Mieding Mountain). Tsongkha

When Master Ba built the Ganden Monastery, he dug out stone materials in the Andori Mountains. When he dug up, he found a treasure that contained the instruments of Dharma King Yama. He dug down and went. He found that someone was meditating in the cave. Jingle, knock, and he was set when he heard it.

After leaving the meditation, he asked: "Lantern, where is the Buddha? Where is King Gege?" King Gege was a king of the Buddha at the time of Burning the Lamp. The monks at that time all knew the Buddha and the King of Gege.

People said to him, "The Lamp Burning Buddha passed away, and the Buddha Shakyamuni passed away after he was born.

"He said, "Oh, I've been in meditation for so long, then I'm leaving."

"After that, he sat down.

If you don't make a vow before meditation, when you will come out of the concentration, the time when you will come out of the concentration is uncertain, and you need the sound of the chime and other instruments to make him come out of the concentration.

Otherwise, before the time to leave the meditation, the power of earth, water, fire and wind will not be able to let him leave the meditation, even if he throws it into the sea, he will still enter the meditation in the sea.

The benefits of meditation If the meditation practice is successful, the performance is that the appearance is alive, and the body is warm.
All the qi has entered the bright spot, the body and the qi outside the body are completely cut off, there is no breathing, and the five senses no longer have qi, and the breath comes in and out.

In this case, there is a fear of being buried or cremated as a dead person.

125

For example, some people say that they don’t dare to practice meditation, and they are worried that they will succeed. After meditation, their body will be cremated by their family members. In fact, this kind of worry is superfluous.

In addition, when practising meditation, because the visualization is the Buddha, the deity, there will be a Dharma protector to protect the practitioners, and people will not be disturbed at will.

For example, Venerable Milareba cultivated meditation. Later, some people thought that he was dead, so they wanted to throw him under the cliff and go, but a few people could not lift him.

There is no need to eat or drink after entering meditation.

Why do people want to eat? It is because they feel hungry. The specific meaning of hunger is that when the stomach is empty, the meat in the stomach wall touches together, compressing the airflow in the middle and moving, and then feeling hungry.

When in a state of meditation, the middle of the stomach is filled with air, and there is no feeling of hunger.

After the achievement of meditation, because the five senses of the eyes, ears, nose, tongue, and body are all concentrated into the consciousness, the consciousness will be very, very clear at this time, so at this time, the visualization of the Buddha will be very clear.

It is the same for me, ordinary people. For example, some deaf and mute people are very smart. This is also the reason. It is because the ear consciousness has entered the consciousness. Smarter.

Therefore, after attaining meditation, great wisdom will be opened, and there will be some miraculous abilities.

If you look at the wall in Dingzhong, you can count how many grains of sand there are;

Wisdom is also very powerful, and it is still growing, and wisdom will become bigger and bigger.

Even if you have achieved a little meditation, you can still hear sounds in the distance, see the scene in the distance, and hear the voice of someone you want to hear.

Venerable Kazanyan was a disciple of Shakyamuni Buddha. Once, once, he went to a small country in India. After arriving there, the king wanted to offer him the entire country, but Venerable Kazanyan said that he could not accept it.

The king thought he thought the whole country was too big, and said, "Half the country." He also said no.

Finally, the king said: "I must make offerings today to support you. The Sangha needs a lot of benefits, and I can provide these items."

Venerable Kazanyan felt that this was still necessary, but he did not know if he had taken it or not.

At that time, Buddha Shakyamuni was in Bodhgaya, India, far away from the small country where the Venerable Kazanyan lived. The Venerable asked Shakyamuni if ​​the Buddha took it according to the Dharma, and the Buddha answered him after hearing it: You can get it if you do.

"The Buddha's ability to hear is through meditation, because the Buddha is always in meditation, and this is the miraculous power of meditation.

On the basis of attaining meditation, the wisdom of practising emptiness will be very fast. Under normal circumstances, it only takes six months if it is fast, and if it is slow, it will take a year to obtain the wisdom of emptiness. It's very easy for me and Dharma Wu.

Matters needing attention when practising meditation (1) Concentrating on meditation can only be accomplished by contemplating meditation at all times.
In the process of practising meditation, when the mind is really unable to settle down, although you can stand up and recite sutras and worship Buddha, you still need to visualize the place of concentration at the same time, and you must be there all the time, including eating and sleeping.

Before going to sleep, first visualize the whole body becoming light, slowly blending into the Buddha's body, and then thinking about the Buddha sleeping all the time.

If you are more capable, you can imagine that the Buddha in the place of concentration emits a beam of light that illuminates the entire universe, and then the universe becomes light, and the light gradually becomes smaller and smaller, and merges into your body.

In the end, the body also turned into light, and slowly merged into the Buddha's body in meditation. Then, I thought about the Buddha all the time, and fell asleep in the state of thinking about the Buddha.

When you wake up, you should immediately visualize the Buddha in the place of concentration clearly. After the visualization, you should take a shower and eat again.

When taking a bath, visualize the cleansing of the Buddha's body, when eating, and when offering offerings to the Buddha in the place of concentration, so that you can quickly achieve meditation.

(2) It is a serious fault to be alert to the drowsy and drowsy places that are blurred and not bright.

During the process of meditating and contemplating, if the concentration is not bright, that is, a subtle drowsiness occurs. In this state, it can be delayed for a long time.

Some people can stay in a drowsy state for a long time, thinking that cultivation has resulted in meditation. This is a big misunderstanding, and the consequences will be very serious.

If you stay in the fine drowsiness for too long, people will gradually become stupid, more and more stupid.

One of my disciples went to South Korea to learn meditation. After three or three months of study, he felt that he was getting more and more stupid, so he asked the master who taught meditation.

Where can such a thing happen? How can you be so stupid as to get rid of troubles? , how to open the wisdom of emptiness? This statement is a great misunderstanding of the practice of meditation.

If you practice meditation correctly, you will become wiser the more you practice.

This is because the more you cultivate your mind, the more concentrated your mind will become, the clearer your mind will become, the more your wisdom will be opened, the faster you will become, and the more intelligent you will become.

There is an old monk in Tibet who has been practising meditation, and he too, encountered subtle drowsiness, and the place of concentration is not bright.

Under such circumstances, he could stay in meditation for a day or two without any problem. At this time, he thought that he was almost finished, and he just kept meditating like this. Later, he could stay in a drowsy state for five or six days without eating. .

Finally, to what extent do you become more and more stupid? The disciple poured him tea and said, "Master, drink tea." He didn't know what to do, so he followed the disciple and said, "Master, drink tea."

I no longer know what tea is and how to drink it.

Therefore, misunderstanding subtle drowsiness is a great obstacle to the practice of meditation.

(3) If wisdom has obtained meditation, the wisdom of emptiness in meditation will be very effective.

quick. It is also very fast to cultivate the five supernatural powers, but we do not cultivate meditation to gain

Achieving divine power is for liberation.

There are many kinds of wisdom, there is the wisdom of the mundane truth, the wisdom of the ultimate truth, and there are many other wisdoms.

What we need to cultivate now is the wisdom of emptiness, the wisdom of the ultimate truth.

The purpose of practising emptiness wisdom is to remove ego and law enforcement.

Everyone has troubles, and the root of troubles is "I".

For example, the source of anger is me, he scolded me, beat me, and blamed me;

The source of greed is also me, I want money;

The source of jealousy is also me, he is better than me, stronger than me, I am not happy;

The source of arrogance is also me

I am rich, I am talented, others are not as good as me.

The root of all troubles is because of me.

Let's think about it again, does this me exist or not?

If there is, what is this me? There is a movie called "Who Am I", we should also think about it and find out who I am and where I am.

When we think this way, we will first notice that if this, I exist, it must be in our own five aggregates, and outside the five aggregates, I should not be found.

The five aggregates are form, feeling, thought, formation, and consciousness. If it is said that this self exists on the five aggregates, and in the five aggregates, form refers to the body, then, is the body me?

Don't talk about ordinary people, many wise sages think so, the body from head to toe is me.

So, is the body really it, is it me? No, just think about it and you will understand: if the body is me, after a person dies, the body exists, but I am gone.

Therefore, the body is not me, that is to say, the form of the five aggregates is not, but me.

So, is the feeling aggregate not me? Feeling is feeling. If the feeling aggregate is me, we have a lot of painful and happy feelings, and I will become a lot.

At least it has to become two: the me who suffers, the me who is happy, and the me who suffers.

But this is impossible, so the feeling aggregate is not me.

In the same way, thinking is not me, thinking is thinking. If thinking is me, we have many thoughts, and I should also become countless, which is also impossible.

Let’s look at the formation aggregate again. The formation is empty. We look at the empty mouth, the empty nose, the empty stomach, and the empty ear in our body. Are these empty me? Certainly not because I only have one.

131

Consciousness consists of six consciousnesses, eye-consciousness, ear-consciousness, nose-consciousness, tongue-consciousness, body-consciousness, and consciousness. The first five consciousnesses are definitely not me. Take eye-consciousness as an example. If there is no eye-consciousness, then the blind person should not exist in me, which is also impossible.

Likewise, yes, ear-consciousness, nose-consciousness, tongue-consciousness, and body-consciousness are not I.

So is consciousness not me? Everyone suspects that consciousness should be me.

There are four major schools of Buddhism: Youbu School, Jingbu School, Wei, Consciousness School, and Madhyamika School.

The Sutra School believes that consciousness is me, and the Madhyamika school will immediately say, if consciousness is me, then people have the consciousness of the past, the life, the consciousness of this life, and the consciousness of the next life. Which one is me? If all three are, I become three, which is impossible;

If it is said that three consciousnesses become one, yes, it is unreasonable.

Therefore, the five aggregates are not really me.

After attaining meditation, find someone without self in meditation: "Where am I? Who am I? Is there me? Is the five aggregates me? Is there a non-existent self in the five aggregates? Anritsu, human?" Wait, after thinking so carefully, you will analyze it very, very clearly, and eventually you will find emptiness.

When emptiness is found, ego-clinging is quickly dismantled.

The source of troubles is the ego-attached ego, and what we are looking for is the ego-attached ego, the false ego.

Does this I exist or not? After such an analysis, it will be understood that I exist, but, yes, this ego-clinging self, the false self, does not exist.

133

The fourth section of the truth of extinction in general, there are two kinds of afflictions: one is the innate affliction, which is the kind of affliction brought by life after life, which is greed, hatred, and delusion;

The other is the afflictions of discrimination, which are the various afflictions that arise in this world.

The antidote to afflictions is San Shi Dao.

The whole San Shi Dao is the way to deal with afflictions. If you can practice diligently and think often, you can suppress afflictions.

Anxiety won't work, it seems like it doesn't. If you feel troubled, you will be very happy.

However, if you encounter a big violation, you will still have a little trouble.

Only by realizing emptiness and relying on the wisdom of emptiness can we completely cut off the afflictions.

Just like a tree, if the roots are pulled out, the branches and leaves will no longer grow.

A person has 84,000 afflictions, and if you cut off one affliction, you will increase by one, and you will share happiness. If you cut off 84,000 afflictions, the happiness of life for the entire Three Realms will not be comparable to this happiness! And this is the eternal great bliss, at this time, it is really happy to be free from suffering.

1. Liberation Liberation is the release of the bondage of the circulation of life and death, free from the pain of samsara and rebirth.

The Sanskrit word for liberation is Nirvana.

Nirvana, also known as Parinirvana, in Chinese, is translated as complete silence, which means complete silence.

Possessing all virtues is perfect, and being free from all afflictions is tranquility.

The original meaning of death is to explain the state after liberation, and later the death of monks is also honored as death.

There are three types of Nirvana: Nirvana with remainder, Nirvana without remainder, and Nirvana without abiding.

(1) A practitioner of residual nirvana who is liberated before passing away is called residual nirvana, nirvana.

The passing away here refers to the death of the practitioner in this life.

That is to say, the afflictions have been cut off, but the human being is still alive, the flesh and the body are still there, and the liberation at this time is called residual nirvana.

For example, the saints such as Sari, Tzu, and Muggallana were ordinary people when they first met Buddha Shakyamuni. After the Buddha taught them the Dharma, they eliminated their afflictions through practice and attained the status of Arhat. .

From the day they become Arhats to the stage before passing away, it is called Nirvana.

(2) Nirvana without remnants not only cuts off the afflictions and liberation, but also does not even have the body brought by the karma of the previous life, that is Nirvana without residue.

That is to say, after passing away, letting go of the physical body and walking away with the light body with wisdom consciousness is nirvana without remainder.

135

Arhats such as Sariputra and Muggallana are currently in Nirvana without remainder.

Specifically, after passing away, the soul is separated from the body, and the body and body are destroyed.

When the soul leaves the body, it becomes an eight-year-old child, a light body of wisdom of the same size.

The soul stays in the light body of wisdom. Wisdom, the light body of wisdom is eternal, it will not get sick, will not grow old, will not die, and will not be reborn again. It is truly free from birth, old age, sickness and death. off.

In Tantra, if the practitioner insists on cultivating the secret method, a light body of wisdom will gradually form in the body. After cultivating to eliminate afflictions, the light body of wisdom will already take shape.

Continue to cultivate, and after reaching a certain level, the light body of wisdom can run outside the body. When it is necessary to save sentient beings, you can return to the physical body again, and then teach the scriptures and spread the Dharma. Wisdom light bodies are also acceptable, so when they go to other Pure Lands to save sentient beings, ordinary people cannot see the wisdom light bodies, but when Bodhisattvas with a higher level of salvation can see them. If, after the light body of wisdom runs out of the body, it sees that his body is old, fragile, and does not want to return to the body, then the body will appear dead;

If you want to go back to your body, you can go back.

Some Arhats can live for hundreds of years because their physical bodies are still available and they can continue to use them. Moreover, these Arhats are not willing to give up their physical bodies for the time being, so they continue to live for hundreds of years.

If the Wisdom Light Body abandons the physical Arhat, it will enter into Nirvana without remainder.

(3) Abstinence Nirvana Abstinence Nirvana is the Nirvana of the Mahayana, which is the Nirvana of the Buddha.

I won't go into details here, I'll talk about it later.

The above is the way of the zhongshi, also known as the way of liberation.

The liberation method of the Middle Path can liberate and liberate many sentient beings, but it cannot save all sentient beings, because people who practice the liberation path do not have the ability to save all sentient beings.

For example, after attaining the status of Arhat, and after attaining the light body of wisdom, one will often enter into concentration, enter into the concentration of cessation, the concentration of happiness, and be very happy in concentration.

Therefore, an Arhat, once entered into meditation, will stay in it for a long time, even for tens of thousands of kalpas.

At this time, if someone asks for help, the Arhat cannot hear it.

When an Arhat does not enter the time, with the power of his vows and the power of blessings, sentient beings will naturally receive some kind of help and some kind of blessing.

After the Buddha passed away, a king in India was very sad when he heard the news of the Buddha's passing away. The Buddha's eldest disciple, Venerable Kasyapa, came to see the king.

Venerable Kasyapa rode an elephant to the palace. The king went to greet Venerable Kasyapa. He also rode an elephant. When he saw Venerable Kasyapa, he immediately jumped down from the elephant and bowed. Venerable Kasyapa used the God, Tong caught him at once, and said to him, "Fortunately, I didn't enter today, or you will be injured."

In addition, an Arhat has only broken the hindrance of afflictions, but has not broken the hindrance of knowledge.

Therefore, the abilities and supernatural powers of an Arhat are limited and cannot be converted to all sentient beings.

There was an old man named Hua Jie, who wanted to become a monk when he was in his 80s. He went and looked for the relic, who looked at it with his supernatural powers and said, "You don't have the fate to become a monk.

"Mu Qianlian said the same thing after looking at it, and in the end, all five hundred Arhats said the same thing.

He thought, "I don't want me at home, and I don't want me in the monastery. My karma is really heavy, so I might as well die." He was about to commit suicide.

At this time, the Buddha stopped him, and the Buddha said, "You became a monk. The fate was planted thousands of kalpas ago, and an Arhat can't see it."

The Buddha continued: "A few thousand kalpas ago, you were a worm on a tree. You fell into the stream under the tree and went around the prayer wheel along the current. This is the reason why you became a monk."

After the old man Huajie became a monk, he went to the Buddha and said, "I want to see what the past life was like.

The Buddha said: "You come with me. "

Take him to a small island in the sea, the island is full of huge bones.

The Buddha said: "You were a very big fish in your previous life, and this is the corpse of your previous life.

After hearing this, he thought to himself, "I actually became such a big animal in my previous life. How many lives should I have killed? The karma is too heavy. No wonder Arhats can't see my destiny as a monk." "

A renunciation arises, and then there is liberation.

An Arhat, like the old man Huajie, cannot see or come out, because his ability is limited and he cannot see what happened in the past.

In addition, Arhats do not possess the Bodhi mind to save sentient beings, so they cannot save all sentient beings.

139

...

The generation of the mind is the central post of the Mahayana path,

The base and support of great waves of conduct,

A philosopher’s stone transforming all into the two collections,

A treasure of merit gathering infinite virtue.

Having understood this, the heroic children of the conquerors

Maintain deeply the pledges of the precious supreme mind.

I, a yogi, practiced like this.

You who desire liberation, should do likewise.

...

——"A Hymn of Experience (Lam rim nyam gur)"

Chapter 3 Shangshi Dao The purpose of our study of Buddhism is to liberate all sentient beings, not just for our own liberation.

Therefore, the purpose of cultivating the Middle Way is not to obtain the fruit of Theravada, but to obtain renunciation, because renunciation is the foundation of bodhicitta.

After attaining renunciation, practice precepts, concentration and wisdom, or practice the Dharma Door of the Four Noble Truths and the Twelve Dependent Origination, to get rid of afflictions and obstacles.

Afterwards, he went on to practice the Shido, with the goal of attaining Buddhahood.

After attaining Buddhahood, the hindrances of knowledge are broken again;

At the same time, when wisdom, blessings, and abilities are all consummated, the conditions for saving sentient beings are met.

In addition, in terms of the fruition of the practice, compared with the Buddhahood of the Mahayana, the Arhatship of Theravada is not perfect.

For the Arhats of Theravada, although the self-clinging has been cut off and the suffering is not so much, it is only broken, the root of karma has been removed, and no new karma will be created.

Since the karmic obstacles are not exhausted, in the stage of residual nirvana, the old karmic obstacles will still bring a little bit of suffering, which will continue until the residual nirvana.

141

Moreover, after completing the Hinayana path of liberation, one must eventually enter the Mahayana path. In this way, it is better to enter the Mahayana path all at once.

More importantly, it is very, very difficult to meet the Mahayana gate, and it is possible to have enough blessings.

In the Kaijing Verse it says:

The incomparably profound and subtle Dharma, which has been encountered in hundreds of thousands of eons, I have seen and heard now, and I have received it. I wish to understand the true meaning of the Tathagata.

What Shang Shidao talks about is the Dharma door. It is a door that can only be encountered after going through hundreds of thousands of kalpas. It requires great blessings.

In the previous life, one must make offerings to the guru's Three Jewels, get close to the guru, and have heard the Mahayana teachings and Dharma. Only such people can have the opportunity to meet the Mahayana door.

Knowing this, we can understand why we need to cultivate the upper School after the completion of the practice. Then, what is the content of the upper sage?

The main practice of Shangshidao is: Bodhicitta;

ten paramitas;

Four shots.

What we need to deal with is the hindrance of knowledge, so we must cultivate both blessings and wisdom.

What we need to know is that all sentient beings in the six realms are their own fathers and mothers, even if they are not in this life, but in previous lives, such as the previous life, the previous life, and so on, they are all very kind to us.

Therefore, for those who are kind and for our own parents, we can't just focus on our own liberation and allow them to suffer in the six realms, but we must initiate the heart that rescues them.

This kind of heart that saves sentient beings from suffering and achieves happiness is Bodhicitta.

The root of Mahayana is Bodhicitta.

Once you get bodhicitta, you will enter the door of the Mahayana. Therefore, the first thing you need to talk about is bodhicitta.

143

The first section of Bodhicitta is Bodhisattva. Bodhisattva is Bodhisattva. The abbreviation, "Bodhisattva" is the literal translation of Sanskrit. Bodhi means that you have fully realized emptiness and fundamentally cut off afflictions and obstacles. , intellectual disability;

Satan means bravery, which means bravely saving sentient beings.

Bodhicitta is divided into vow bodhicitta and action bodhichitta.

In order to save all sentient beings, making a vow to attain great Bodhi is called vow Bodhicitta;

On the basis of making a vow, practice the six degrees of ten thousand deeds to realize this vow, which is called Bodhisattva, the mind.

Bodhicitta is further divided into twenty-two levels. The lowest level is called "earth bodhicitta". We see that the earth sometimes changes, and the earth and bodhicitta are also the same, sometimes regressing;

The second level of bodhicitta is called "Golden Bodhicitta". We know that the nature of gold is very stable. No matter how it is burned or cut with a knife, the essence of gold will not change. will go back.

We now feel that sometimes we have bodhicitta, and sometimes we do not, because we have not yet attained true bodhichitta.

The present bodhicitta is false bodhicitta, also known as artificial bodhichitta.

1. The merits and benefits of developing bodhicitta When talking about bodhicitta, we must first understand the merits and benefits of bodhicitta.

From the moment when a practitioner develops Bodhicitta, he can be called a Bodhisattva, a Sagittarius, or a son of Buddha. He will continue to receive the blessings of the Buddhas and Tathagatas, and obtain and achieve numerous extraordinary merits and benefits.

(1) Entering the Mahayana door and obtaining bodhicitta means entering the Mahayana door. Before attaining bodhicitta, even if one has realized emptiness, or obtained merits such as renunciation, existence, and five supernatural powers, it is not considered to be a Mahayana path.

Taking refuge is the door to Buddhism, getting close to the guru is the door to the three ways, obtaining renunciation is the door to the way of liberation, obtaining bodhicitta is the door to the great, the door to the road, and obtaining the empowerment of the tantric method is the door to the tantric vehicle.

(2) Those who receive the name of Buddha's son are called Bodhisattva.

If a king's son ascends the throne, all the people will respect him, because the prince is the kingdom and the king's heir.

Among the sentient beings in the six realms, if any one develops Bodhi and mind, he will become a son of Buddha, the successor of the Buddha, who will receive the name of Bodhisattva and be respected by sentient beings in the six realms.

145

A person who has aroused bodhicitta is a bodhisattva, regardless of race, status, or level. Whether he is a bodhisattva or not depends on whether he has bodhicitta or not.

(3) A bodhisattva who surpassed Theravada Arhats who just developed Bodhicitta, surpassed sound in the convenient method, and surpassed Arhats and Hans in saving sentient beings.

Since the Bodhisattva of the Seven Grounds, he has surpassed Arhats in wisdom.

(4) After receiving the blessings of the Buddhas and Tathagatas and attaining bodhicitta, one can quickly practice and become a Buddha, and it is difficult to achieve bodhicitta.

The energy of bodhicitta is very great. If one cultivates bodhicitta, the thrones of all Buddhas and Tathagatas will vibrate. If they see the practitioner who has aroused bodhicitta, they will immediately come to bless him.

Nagarjuna Bodhisattva quoted the sutra in "The Essence of Mahayana Treasures" and said that if a bodhisattva who has attained bodhicitta sits in a carriage and no one pulls the carriage, the Buddhas and Tathagatas will pull the carriage.

Because the Bodhisattva is the successor of the Buddhas and Tathagatas, the sons of the Buddhas, and the Buddhas, the Tathagatas will continue to bless him, just like a child sitting in a carriage, his father and mother love him and will pull the carriage.

(5) Accumulating blessings day and night and sending bodhicitta is the most excellent way to accumulate merit.

Tsong, Master Kaba said in the "Song of the Steps of the Bodhi Path":

Exhaust the two grains, point gold and stones, and gather blessings in the boundless sea of ​​goodness.

All the masters of the Buddha see and know, the treasure of bodhicitta is the most important.

It means that the altruistic power of bodhicitta is inconceivable, that is, the golden stone that increases the two resources of blessing and wisdom, is a treasure that can accumulate boundless virtues like the ocean.

It is also stated in the Treatise on Entering the Bodhisattva:

When is the time to end, there are boundless realms of love, resolve not to turn back, and are accepting and upholding that heart.

That is to say, from that time on, in sleep or relaxation, the meritorious power is constant, and the quantity and so on are produced in emptiness.

After receiving the Bodhisattva Precepts and attaining Bodhicitta, the blessings continue to increase day and night.

Even in sleep or in relaxation, there will be blessings as great as emptiness.

(6) Elimination of karmic obstacles Bodhicitta has a very strong ability to eliminate karmic obstacles. From the moment of attaining bodhicitta, even if you do not recite sutras, repentance texts, or recite the Vajrasattva Hundred-Symbols, karmic obstacles will be eliminated.

147

Day and night, karma will be eliminated, and what is eliminated are all big karma.

In the Treatise on Entering Bodhisattva Actions, it says:

That kind of good deeds is small and eternal, and evil deeds are powerful and terrifying

Besides perfecting bodhicitta, what kind of good deeds can overcome it?

With bodhicitta, great karma can be eliminated in an instant.

Therefore, it is also said in "On Entrying into the Bodhisattva's Actions":

This is like a fire at the end of a calamity that can burn that great evil karma to ashes in an instant.

At the end of the world, seven suns will appear in the sky, and the heat will burn up Mount Sumeru.

The same is true of Bodhicitta. Like the end of a kalpa, a great fire can completely burn all our karmic obstacles.

(7) According to the bodhicitta, the bodhisattva will be free from the disasters of earth, water, fire, and wind, and there will be no major plagues, natural disasters, etc.

The power of bodhicitta can also quench disasters.

For example, if there is a fire in a person's house, the Bodhisattva sees it and says, "If my bodhicitta is true and true, the fire should be extinguished immediately."

After attaining Bodhi, the heart of the Bodhisattva speaks this mantra, and the fire will be extinguished.

If there is a great disaster, even if the Bodhisattva speaks a mantra, it will be eliminated.

In the past, there were very few diseases in the human world, especially in Tibet, the diseases were especially rare.

The main reason was that many people in Tibet at that time had attained Bodhi. The great achievers and Bodhisattvas of the mind were protecting sentient beings and quelling the difficulty of disease. This was the energy of Bodhicitta.

The people around the Bodhisattva are influenced by the bodhicitta energy. If the afflictions are big, the troubles will naturally gradually decrease, become gentle, and they will not fight, quarrel, or even fight.

In the previous Tibetan areas, there were many people who practiced and obtained bodhicitta.

Tibet has not been ruled by King Langdama since King Langdama. There has been more than a thousand years from King Langdama to liberation. During such a long period of time, in the absence of political power, all parts of Tibetan There has been no war.

In the history of our Han region, there must be a war in about twenty years. During the Zhenguan period of the Tang Dynasty, it was considered a prosperous age. Although there was no civil strife, there was still a war against foreign invasions.

However, there has been no civil strife in Tibetan areas for more than a thousand years, and there has been no war due to external causes. This is all because there are Bodhisattvas in Tibetan areas, and the hearts of the Bodhisattvas will naturally calm down.

There is nothing that the Tibetans are superior to other ethnic groups, but there is one thing that is very special. After more than a thousand years of being influenced by Buddhism, Buddhism and Buddhism have truly penetrated into the hearts of every Tibetan.

149

Therefore, there are many people in Tibet who study Buddhism, practice Buddhism, and monks, and there are many Bodhisattvas who have attained Bodhicitta.

The bodhisattva's bodhicitta energy dispels all the troubles and resentments in the hearts of sentient beings, and the mind naturally becomes peaceful.

When Master Yeshe Gyatso was alive, there were many wolves in Tibet. If Master went to a certain village, and influenced by Master's Bodhi mind, the wolves would play with the sheep and would not eat the sheep.

One day, wolves began to eat sheep again, and some people said that maybe the master passed away, and that was the case later.

(8) After developing bodhicitta without being disturbed by obstacles, in addition to receiving the blessings and upholdings of the Buddhas and Tathagatas, you will also receive offerings and respect from the earth gods, dragons, and heavenly protectors.

From the day of attaining bodhicitta, one will receive the protection of the Dharma protector.

Not only will you be protected by Buddhas, Bodhisattvas and good deities, but ghosts and demons will also come to worship, and you will not be harmed by demons.

Not only have high-level Bodhicitta attained, but also those who have just awakened Bodhicitta.

In the past, after Master Langri Tangpa developed bodhicitta, many demons and ghosts came to protect and support them, and they harmed other people, but to Master Langri Tangpa, they said: "The ghosts and the living beings in the devil's way cannot harm them. Master Ritangba! Because of his bodhicitta, he is better than us, we must make offerings to him, and we must not harm him!"

In order to save sentient beings, the great siddhis will sometimes subdue demons or ghosts who are more powerful than evil.

When subduing them, it is usually a big one. The accomplished person recites a mantra and makes an oath and precept for ghosts or demons. For example, he says, "From now on, you can't harm sentient beings! If you harm sentient beings, they will split open."

Wait, after they promised, if they break this oath, their heads will really crack, so they won't make this oath, promise.

If you want to get out of the control of this mantra, you have to generate Bodhicitta, raise your mind, and the mantra will not work after you generate the Bodhicitta mind.

However, after developing Bodhicitta, it will not harm sentient beings.

(9) Rapid Achievement Everyone thinks that becoming a Buddha is difficult, but it is not.

If you get bodhicitta, it will be very easy to accumulate blessings and eliminate karmic obstacles, and you will become a Buddha very quickly, so it is not difficult to become a Buddha.

Where is the difficulty? The most difficult thing is to achieve impermanence in life, to observe, and then to obtain renunciation, and then to obtain bodhicitta.

If you get bodhicitta and practice the deity Dharma, you can see the deity with your own eyes in seven days at the fastest, or even a few months later.

If you recite mantras, or practice the method of increasing your breath, it will be accomplished very quickly, that's all.

151

Moreover, after attaining bodhicitta, even in rebirth, the merit and virtue of bodhicitta will not be regressed. In this way, the practice in later life will be easy, and the achievement will be faster.

Therefore, Master Tsongkhapa said: "Bodhicitta is the most special and successful cause of becoming a Buddha, it is the core of Mahayana Buddhism, it is what Buddhas and Bodhisattvas cultivate, and the heart is the most precious wishful treasure in the world and beyond the world. It is healing and greed. A panacea for madness."

To cultivate according to the ritual, there is one who has achieved Bodhi, and the ritual of the heart. We recite this ritual every day:

All the buddhas, the wonderful Dharma, the esteemed people, even Bodhi, I take refuge,

I perform all kinds of offerings, and I wish to become a Buddha in order to save sentient beings.

Recite this ritual three times.

The wonderful Dharma of all the Buddhas is in the middle of the assembly, and all the Buddhas are there. These Buddhas and Tathagatas, and the wonderful Dharma is the eighty-four thousand Dharma doors.

After taking refuge in the Three Jewels, I arouse Bodhicitta again: I practice all kinds of alms, and I wish to become a Buddha in order to save sentient beings.

"Giving and other resources" is the six qualities of the Bodhisattva, giving is giving, and the six qualities are giving, keeping precepts, patience, diligence, meditation, and wisdom.

It means that we have done so many good deeds for the purpose of becoming a Buddha, and becoming a Buddha is to save and transform sentient beings in the six realms. It is very clear.

We should always recite this, the rituals, when Master Zhu Kangwa sees everyone, he will recite "For the sake of saving all beings, I wish to become a Buddha", and always generate Bodhicitta.

When giving tantric empowerments, this ritual is usually used to pass the bodhisattva vows.

There is also a great ritual for developing bodhicitta. It is relatively long and requires a lot of offerings. Then, follow the master to learn to develop bodhi and mind. Frequently reciting this ritual can accumulate great blessings.

The above mentioned are the rituals of cultivating bodhicitta. There are two ways to truly generate bodhichitta: the seven-factor cause and effect to generate bodhichitta, the exchange from others, and the bodhichitta.

Among them, the bodhicitta generated by the seven branches of cause and effect does not include the bodhicitta generated by the self-exchange, and the bodhicitta generated by the self-exchange includes all the seven, and the bodhicitta generated by the cause and effect.

(1) Seven branches of cause and effect generate bodhicitta. Seven branches of cause and effect generate bodhichitta, which is based on seven steps to generate bodhicitta.

The sequence is: identify all beings as mothers, miss mother's kindness, repay mother's kindness, show kindness, show compassion, increase sense of responsibility, and show bodhicitta.

177

In these seven steps, the generation of the following thoughts requires the former to do, as the premise, it is a causal relationship, so it is called the seven branches of cause and effect to generate bodhicitta.

The cause of bodhicitta is to increase the sense of responsibility, the cause of the increased sense of responsibility is compassion, the cause of compassion is compassion, the cause of compassion is to repay the mother's kindness, the cause of the repayment of the mother's kindness is to miss the mother's kindness, to miss the mother's kindness. Mother, the cause of grace is to recognize that all living beings are mothers.

This is the fundamental principle of Mahayana Buddhism, which recognizes that all sentient beings in the six realms are their own mothers.

Acknowledging that all beings are mothers Before cultivating the practice of recognizing that all beings are mothers, one must first develop a mind of equality among all beings.
The equanimity mentioned here means that there is no distinction between enemies and friends, and all living beings are treated with an equanimity.

If you don't even have the heart to treat all sentient beings equally, it is impossible to identify all sentient beings as mothers.

When we treat all beings, our hearts are often unequal.

For example, there is anger towards enemies, greed and joy towards relatives and friends, ignoring and ignoring those who are neither friends nor enemies, etc.

When we think about the truth of suffering, we talk about relatives and hatreds changing and impermanent, etc., and we will understand that when we treat sentient beings in this way, it is actually wrong.

In rebirth, the enemy has been my friend many times;

Friends and relatives have been our enemies many times;

People who are neither enemies nor friends have been friends and relatives as well as enemies in the past.

All sentient beings are circulating in samsara, and they have all been our enemies, relatives and friends. Therefore, all sentient beings are equal.

Not only that, but now they are friends and enemies, and they can't always be in the future.

Therefore, it is unreasonable to be greedy or angry with sentient beings.

In addition, all living beings also suffer from the suffering of rebirth. From this point of view, all living beings are equal.

By thinking like this often, you can slowly cultivate your own equality and heart.

If you can treat your relatives, friends, enemies, and those who are not friends or enemies equally, you can try to cultivate equanimity toward other sentient beings.

If you can treat other sentient beings equally, you will stop the evil deeds caused by the separation of enemies and friends, such as attacking enemies, indulging in love for relatives and friends, etc. People who have the separation of enemies and friends will not be able to generate bodhicitta.

After being able to treat all sentient beings equally, it will be very, very easy to cultivate and recognize that all sentient beings are mothers.

How to identify it? If we think about it seriously, we will realize and realize that the soul of all living beings is beginningless, and so is rebirth.

Since the beginningless kalpa, we have been reborn countless times, more times than the sand in the universe.

Every time we are reborn, there are sentient beings who do it, our parents, so it is said that all sentient beings in the six realms have done ours, our parents.

And more than once or twice, sentient beings in the six realms have been our parents countless times. Even if they are not mothers in this life, they are also mothers in past lives.

179

Continue to think about this truth, but also think of: some annoying, annoying animals, such as mosquitoes or cockroaches.

Mosquito bites will itch, and they will spread diseases, so people want to shoot it to death when they see it, and the same is true for cockroaches.

So, have we ever thought that now, a mosquito or a cockroach is because in a certain life, when we were our mothers, when we were kissing, we did a lot of bad karma for our own children, and they turned into samsara. It looks like this now.

If you think about it again, you will realize that these mother sentient beings are all for us, that is, they went to hell, fell into the animal realm, and became sentient beings of other realms.

Now, they have changed, and an appearance has appeared. What reason do we have to hate them, kill them?

Therefore, we have to generate the mind that all sentient beings are mothers.

First, it will be more difficult at the beginning. You can ask for the blessing of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas: "Pray, the blessing of the Three Jewels of the Guru, let me have the heart to recognize that all sentient beings are mothers." Always pray.

When some karmic obstacles have disappeared, there will be a feeling: when you see an ant, you will feel that you are a mother, and when you see a mosquito, you will also feel that it must be a mother, and you will have such a mentality and feeling.

There is a great siddhis named Shangpa Rinpoche. His achievements are very, very high. When he preaches the Three Ways, because of his blessing power, a small or small house can accommodate 3,000 people, and the blessing power is very large.

Every spring and autumn, Shangpa Rinpoche would lecture on the Three Ways, and every time he lectured, he would say: "Those who sincerely practice Mahayana Buddhism must first recognize that all sentient beings are mothers, and they must make great efforts in this regard.

When you see a bug, or some other animal, you must immediately think of it, it is your mother, and when no one is there to cry, you can cry and say, 'Mother, you are so pitiful' and so on."

Once, when Venerable Atisha was teaching the scriptures, he suddenly said to a disciple, Tzu, "Go to the forest below immediately, your mother is going to be hanged."

The disciple had bad legs, and said anxiously, "Oh, mother, why are you going to hang yourself?" He immediately ran into the forest, running around, looking for his mother with great difficulty.

Later, I saw an old horse with its neck caught between two trees and was about to get stuck, so he rescued the horse.

When he came back, he said to Venerable Atisha, "Sir, my mother is not in the forest.

But there was an old dead horse that was about to get stuck, and I rescued it.

Venerable Atisha said: "Then, the old horse is the mother of your previous life. "

When Venerable Atisha was about to pass away, many people came to say goodbye to him.

Everyone cried very sadly, and everyone said, "His Holiness is going to pass away, and he will never be seen again!" It was very painful in their hearts.

The Venerable then said to Master Zhongdunpa, "If someone in the future says that he has no good fortune and has never seen Atisha, don't think so.

The Dharma taught by Atisha is bodhicitta, and when one develops bodhicitta, it is like seeing Atisha in person. "

We must develop bodhicitta well, the basis is here.

There is a great siddha in India named Zamba Yeshe Jepa. After his mother died, in order to find her, he cultivated supernatural powers.

With God, after observation, I found that my mother was reborn in a rich family in Tibet and became a bug under the stove.

He came to Tibet, and there, a rich man kept sheep for three years.

Three years later, he asked the owner for permission, permission, to dig up the stove, find the bug, and recite the scriptures to get over it.

Turning around, he saw that another bug had died where he was sitting. He observed it with the help of God, and saw that it was his mother from the previous seven lives, and he had saved it.

Therefore, all beings such as bugs, ants, and mosquitoes that we see may be the mothers of our previous lives.

The ones who often meet must be the ones with fate, the mosquitoes without fate can't enter the room, we can't see the bugs without fate, and there are no living beings who have no fate, they will meet.

It is very likely that our parents, grandparents and other relatives and friends who are destined to meet are reborn after death.

It is very, very important to recognize that all sentient beings are mothers.

Shakyamu, Ni Buddha once said when he taught the Mahayana Dharma: "There is no one place for sentient beings that has not been born. Since beginningless, there has not been a single sentient being who has not been us. Mother, all sentient beings are our parents."

When someone visited Venerable Atisha and saw flies in his house, they went to fight them.

His Holiness said: "Don't hit it, it is my mother."

A saint with infinite supernatural powers like Venerable Atisha, who can see all beings, has all been his own parents.

We ordinary people can't see it yet, and those with a little supernatural power can see the mothers of past lives, previous lives, or hundreds of lives, and will find that some mothers are in hell, some are beasts, some are in the world, and some are in the human world. .

Those with a higher level of cultivation will see it more and for a longer period of time.

After the death of Venerable Mujianlian's mother, he used his supernatural powers to see, why, he couldn't see the mother in this life, all he saw was the mother in the previous life, dear.

The Venerable went to ask Buddha Shakyamuni, and the Buddha said, "It's too far away. Your supernatural powers are limited and you can't see it."

Then, the Buddha took Mujian and even went to that world.

Also in the human world, his mother was reborn as a woman and was carrying water.

The Venerable taught the Dharma to his mother, and his mother practiced liberation.

Because Venerable Mugallian saw himself, his mother for many lifetimes, so Venerable often went around to save sentient beings, thinking that these were his mothers and should save them.

Why is Guanyin Bodhisattva so brave to save sentient beings? This is because Guanyin Bodhisattva used to be very diligent, and he gave Bodhi in front of Amitabha Buddha. When he was in his heart, Amitabha Buddha blessed him and let Guanyin Bodhisattva look at his mother in previous life, previous life, and past life. He is very brave and uses the greatest compassion to save sentient beings.

It is very important to have the belief that all sentient beings in the six realms belong to your mother.

After thinking about the kindness of the mother after thinking that all sentient beings in the six realms are their own mothers, think about the kindness of mothers: Before we are born, we stay in the mother's womb for more than nine months, and during the nine months, the mother's womb It takes days and nights to carry this seven-eight-pound mass of meat. In order not to hurt the child, I have to be careful everywhere.
During pregnancy, for the sake of the child, many things cannot be eaten or touched, and many things that you want to do cannot be done.

The newborn baby is very dirty, and the mother should not be afraid of being dirty, smelly, or tired.

A mother regards her children as her lifeblood, more important than her own life.

When a child is sick, it hurts more than when he is sick. When a child has an accident, it is even more sad than when he has an accident.

Master Bodova once said: "For a child before the age of five, it is said that the mother saves his life every day.

At this time, if there is no father or mother to take care of them, they will die of thirst, starvation, falling or dying of illness.

Therefore, from birth to the age of five, parents are saving their children's lives every day, and there is a life-saving grace! "

It is a mother's grace to survive, and it is a mother's grace to grow well.

In particular, it is a mother's favor for girls who have no scars on their faces, which means that when they were young, their mother took good care of them and did not hurt them, so there are no scars or disabilities on their faces and bodies.

Being able to speak is also a mother's grace.

From "Dad, Mom", every sentence is taught by my parents. If my parents didn't teach me, I would definitely not be able to speak. This is 100%.

There used to be a kind of human bear (brown bear) in Tibet. It likes to snatch human children back and raise them. When children who live with human bears grow up, they can't stand, walk, walk on their stomachs, and can't talk because human bears If the mother is not taught to speak, the child will not be able to speak.

Therefore, it is mother's grace that we can talk now, and it is mother's grace that we can walk.

Think about it in every aspect, it's all the grace of your parents.

Some people don't have a good relationship with their mother. They think that their mother is right and that they have nothing to do. It's wrong to think so.

In the process of growing up, I will gradually have my own opinions, and I may have some differences or disagreements with my mother, resulting in a less harmonious relationship, but it cannot be said that there is no mother's grace.

Then, continue to think, not only the grace of the mother in this life, but also the grace of the mother in life and life.

All sentient beings in the six realms were once our mothers, dear, we must think of the great kindness and virtue of all sentient beings to us.

185

For example, the mothers of beasts are very compassionate. When a cow is pregnant with a calf, if she is beaten on the stomach, she will immediately turn around and let her be beaten. The same is true for her ass and the ewe.

The mother of the hungry ghost is also very kind to her child.

Hungry ghosts are womb-born, they can give birth. A hungry ghost can give birth to hundreds of children. If you really can't find it, if you can't eat it, it will bite the flesh from your own body for the children to eat. Hungry ghost mothers have such a great kindness for their children. .

Just like this, think about the grace of this life, past life, people, Dharma and other Taoist parents in every aspect.

There are many people who have children themselves, understand their parents, and feel their parents when they are adults.

If the parents are still alive, well, if they are gone, they will leave a lifetime of regrets.

After Master Tsongkhapa went to Tibet, he never returned to the Amdo area.

The master's mother wrote him a letter saying, "My child, I want to see you."

He took out another piece of white hair and sent it to Tsongkhapa, Master.

Master Tsongkhapa has been preaching the Dharma in Tibet. At that time, he was at the peak of his teaching career. He taught a lot of sutras every day.

After seeing his mother's letter, Master Tsongkhapa said: "Mother's kindness is the greatest kindness. Since I can't go back, I will paint a Thangka to accompany me, mother."

The master painted a thangka in a few days and asked a businessman named Norsan to bring it back to Amdo.

When Norsang arrived in Amdo, he gave the thangka to the master's mother.

As soon as this Thangka was opened, the image of Tsongkhapa in the Thangka said, "Hello, mother!" The mother's heart was relieved all of a sudden, she missed her son, and the pain of her son disappeared, just like seeing her son with her own eyes. .

The mother of the master hangs the thangka in her room and faces it when she has time. When the master Tsongkhapa on the thangka speaks, the statue of the master on the thangka will respond.

Master Tsongkhapa himself painted two thangkas, one for his mother and the other for his sister.

The Tang, the card for my mother is now in the Kadikawa Temple in Qinghai, and the one for my sister is in the Dajinwa Temple in the Ta'er Temple.

When cultivating the kindness of missing your mother, you must first recognize that the sentient beings in the six realms are your own mothers. If you still can’t do this, you can start from thinking about the kindness of the present, the birth mother. become more and more extensive.

Repaying Mother's Grace After I miss my mother's kindness, I think about how to repay my mother's kindness.
As for the mother in this life, if she is still alive, we can repay the mother's kindness with practical actions, such as taking care of her and honoring her.

Honoring one's mother is the lowest degree of repayment for her kindness, and then introducing her to Buddhism and letting her practice the Dharma.

If the mother is no longer alive, we should treat all sentient beings in the six realms as mothers, as the mothers of our previous lives and previous lives.

In the Treatise on Entering Bodhisattva Actions, it says:

Great compassion for all the Buddhas, seeing all as oneself,

Since the living Buddha is of the same body, why not respect all living beings?

That is to say, the Buddha sees all living beings as he sees himself. Since all living beings are of the same nature as the Buddha, why not respect all living beings the same way as respecting the Buddha? Respecting the Buddha will bring blessings, and treating all living beings with respect will also give birth and bring blessings. .

Therefore, we should treat the six realms and sentient beings as we treat our mothers, and do our best to honor them.

How to be filial? Do your best to help people.

Moreover, we must realize that the material help in this world can only temporarily eliminate the suffering of sentient beings, and the only thing that can truly enable sentient beings to have happiness and be free from pain and suffering is to become a Buddha.

Therefore, we should think: "I want to make one, all sentient beings become Buddhas as soon as possible!" To achieve this, we must first become Buddhas, and to become Buddhas, we must first obtain Bodhicitta.

If there is really no way to help sentient beings, when we see poor sentient beings, we will recite a few six-character mantras, and then return the blessings to them.

Doing this regularly will also help develop compassion.

Loving kindness, also known as merciful kindness, is a state of mind that cherishes and cherishes each other.
Master Bodova once said to an old grandmother: "Yue, yi ci is the kind of loving-kindness you have for your son."

Treating all sentient beings as the children of our own will is the kindness and kindness that only Buddhas, Bodhisattvas, and Sagittarius have, and the kindness and kindness we want to get.

(1) How to develop loving-kindness To practice loving-kindness, first of all, you must show loving-kindness to your own mother.

To develop loving-kindness towards a mother is not to crave the mother, but to have, true love.

First visualize my biological mother in front of me, and then think: This person in front of me is not only my mother in this life, but also has been my mother many times in my life and life, and she is so kind to me As vast as the void.

If you think about the grace of your mother in this way, you will naturally give birth to a heart that loves your mother. This is the heart of true love.

189

Compassion is to give happiness, to give happiness to all beings.

So, again, think about it, did your mother get Anle and Anleine? , Well-being is a peaceful and happy life.

If the mother cannot live comfortably because she has no house or child, have we ever thought of giving her a house? , If your mother is sick, have you ever thought of giving your mother a good medical treatment, medicine, and a speedy recovery? If you have the idea of ​​wanting your mother to be happy, peaceful and happy, you will develop loving-kindness towards your mother.

After being able to develop loving-kindness towards one's own mother, be compassionate towards the people around, relatives and friends;

And then show mercy to those who have an opinion about yourself, the enemy.

If you can send it out, then, show mercy to everyone on the four continents.

After being able to generate loving-kindness in human beings, then send loving-kindness to all beings in the heavenly realm, asuras.

If you can develop loving-kindness, then, in turn, show loving-kindness to all beings in the animal realm, the hungry ghost realm, and the hell realm.

In this way, one should develop loving-kindness towards all beings in the six realms.

To test whether there is loving kindness, the main thing is to see whether there is jealousy.

Jealousy means not enough loving-kindness;

When you truly send out loving-kindness, there will be no jealousy at all.

If you are often jealous of others, you can try to blame yourself: I don’t have loving-kindness, I don’t, I should be jealous.

In this way, the mentality will gradually change.

(2) If the eight virtues of radiating loving-kindness can truly generate loving-kindness, the virtues will be enormous.

It is stated in the "Bao Ga Lun":

Three o'clock every day, three hundred cans of food,

However, it is not as long as a moment, and I can cultivate a point of kindness.

All heavenly beings are loving, they are always guarding,

Joy is much more comfortable, and poisonous knives cannot penetrate.

To accomplish nothing without labor, to be born in the world of Brahma,

If you are unable to liberate, you will obtain the eight virtues of loving-kindness.

This means that if someone gives three hundred jars of food and drink to sentient beings three times a day, the merit is of course very, very great, but no, the merit of cultivating loving-kindness in an instant.

Cultivating kindness and love can also gain people's blessings, such as God's protection, comfort and joy, avoiding the poison of swords and soldiers, doing things without hard work, you can achieve success through hard work, and reincarnating Brahma in future generations.

Even if you don't have this life, you can get liberated, and you will get the benefits of the eight great virtues of loving kindness.

1) All beings will be happy. People who often show loving kindness always have a loving smile on their faces, and everyone will like them when they see it.

Because of the warmth in him that everyone can feel.

191

When Dharma King Yongzeng was alive, everyone was very happy to see him, even Muslims, because of his loving kindness.

Yeshe, no matter where Dharma King Gyatso goes, no matter what religion, religion, or nationality he encounters, everyone likes him very much and welcomes him.

2) The heart will be very peaceful and happy. When Dharma King Yeshe Gyatso lectured on the sutras, he often said: "I have nothing, I have no special merit, I put my head on the pillow and fell asleep, this is my merit.

"This shows that he has a loving heart.

It is not easy for those without loving-kindness to fall asleep, and even if they do not sleep well, they are always uneasy and worried.

3) The swordsmen and poisonous demons cannot harm him. When Buddha Shakyamuni was about to become a Buddha, many emperors and demons came to hinder him. "

The Son of Heaven Demon tempted the Buddha and said, "Stop practicing, Devadatta, if you want to be a king, he will harm all beings.

Buddha Shakyamuni ignored them, and they gave many reasons, such as "Your parents are sick" and so on.

But the Buddha is motionless, always resting in loving-kindness concentration.

The Son of Heaven Demon turned into a lot of beautiful women, but he still couldn't, disturbing the Buddha.

In the end, the Emperor Demon had no choice, so he turned out a lot of knives and spears to slash the Buddha.

At this time, the Buddha sent out loving-kindness, and the sword and spear became a lotus. This is the energy of a benevolent heart.

In the past, someone threw a poison to Master Jiamu-like Xieba of Labrang Monastery. After being poisoned, the master felt a little uncomfortable.

At this time, Amdo, a master in the area, said to Master Jiamutang Xieba: "If you are truly cultivated to the level of loving-kindness, you will be able to expel the poison.

If you can't detoxify, I will blow up the Potala Palace.

"Master Jiamu-like Xieba said: "No, it must be like this. "

After speaking, the poison was expelled down his fingers.

Great love turns poison into nectar;

Moderate loving-kindness can expel toxins.

The merits of loving-kindness are so great that swords, spears, and weapons cannot harm those who have loving-kindness.

Shangpa Rinpoche from India has a very high achievement and a great love and kindness. When the birds in the sky see him, they will come down and fly around him three times before walking around. They are very happy.

Tigers, lions and other beasts saw him, and the same was true.

Once, there was a war, and the two sides in the war were in chaos, hacking and killing. Shanpa Rinpoche happened to pass by this place. When everyone saw him, they put down their swords and guns, and no longer wanted to kill.

4) All things go well without hard work. People with loving-kindness will get the help of human beings and all beings. When doing things, they don’t have to work very hard, and they will naturally have their wishes.

193

5) Anyone who is free to be reborn in a pure land in another place can be reborn in another place, in a pure land at will, after the death of a person who has obtained loving-kindness.

If they want to be reborn in the Western Pure Land, if ordinary people recite Ami, the Buddha may not be guaranteed to be reborn, but after receiving loving kindness, they can definitely be reborn in the Western Paradise.

(3) How to cultivate loving-kindness So, how do we cultivate loving-kindness? It can be cultivated by the method of visualization.

First of all, we must make our mind: May all sentient beings be blessed with happiness and the cause of happiness.

Then, visualize your body becoming a wish-fulfilling jewel, and innumerable wish-fulfilling jewels appear in the wish-fulfilling jewel, and then visualize giving the wish-fulfilling jewel to every sentient being. Whatever sentient beings want, the wish-fulfilling jewel will manifest at will. .

Through this kind of visualization, all sentient beings in the six realms can obtain peace, happiness and the cause of happiness.

Compassion is to relieve suffering. Compassion is the heart that wishes all sentient beings to be free from suffering and the causes of suffering.
Suffering is suffering, affliction is affliction;

The cause of suffering is creation, doing the ten evil deeds, breaking precepts, and doing bad deeds.

May all sentient beings not only stay away from pain and affliction, but also stay away from the cause of suffering and affliction, that is, compassion.

Compassion is great compassion.

The seven branches of the Mahayana cause Bodhi, and the most precious thing in the heart is compassion. With compassion, the ability to save people and life will become very, very great.

(1) The importance of great compassion It is very, very important to have compassion.

First of all, having compassion and heart is one of the important differences between Buddhism and heresy.

Secondly, compassion and heart are also the foundation of Mahayana Buddhist practice.

Master Tsongkhapa specifically pointed out in the section of the judgment on the stages of cultivating bodhicitta in "The Extensive Treatise on the Stages of the Path of Bodhisattva", stating: "The root of the Mahayana path is great compassion", and "All, the remaining cause and effect is the truth of this cause and effect".

It means that all the fruits of Mahayana Buddhism all come from compassion.

The "Zheng She Dharma Sutra" also says: "World Honored One, like the wheel-turning saint, wherever the King's Wheel Treasure arrives, all the armies arrive there.

World Honored One, such a Bodhisattva, where great compassion comes, all Buddhadharma comes to him. "

The wheel treasure of the wheel-turning king is used to transport the army. The meaning of this verse is to say, just as the place where the wheel-turning king's wheel treasure is, all the armies will go there;

Buddhas and Bodhisattvas teach sutras and dharmas are also initiated by compassion. Wherever the bodhisattva's great compassion can be, all the Buddha's teachings will also be propagated in that place.

In the "Treatise on Entering the Middle" written by Yuecheng Bodhisattva, the first chapter of the stanza says:

In the voice-hearer, the Buddha can be reborn as a king, and all the Buddhas are reborn from the Bodhisattva.

Great compassion and incomparable wisdom, Bodhicitta is the cause of the son of Buddha.

It means that the Shravaka and the Arhats were born because of the teachings of the Buddha, and the Buddha was born from the cultivation of the Bodhisattva.

However, the bodhisattva was first born by cultivating great compassion, and then cultivating emptiness wisdom and Bodhisattva, which shows the importance of great compassion.

Therefore, in order to become a Buddha, the first and foremost thing is to cultivate great compassion.

The second verse that follows immediately says:

Compassion is the great fruit of the Buddha, like a seed growing like water at first.

If you can use it all the time, if it is mature, I will first praise the great compassion.

That is to say, in order to obtain such a vast blessing as a Buddha, when a bodhisattva first develops his mind, he needs to have a great compassion in order to induce bodhi, the seed of the heart, because bodhicitta is the cause of a bodhisattva, and great compassion is a bodhisattva.

cause for concern;

When practicing Bodhisattva in the middle stage, there must be the water of great compassion, so that the seeds of bodhicitta will not wither, and will grow day by day;

When the Bodhisattva becomes a Buddha in the later period, he will show his retribution body or incarnation with great compassion, teach and transform all beings, and let all beings obtain real benefits.

If there is no great compassion, the heart will be unwilling to help sentient beings to liberate, and will be like an Arhat who has entered Nirvana by himself, and sentient beings will not be helped.

Therefore, for becoming a Buddha, every moment of the first, middle, and last three periods of practice, compassion and heart are always the most important.

It is also stated in the "Jing Zhuang Lun":

Without the root of compassion, one cannot endure the suffering of practice,

If you can't endure suffering, nothing will happen to benefit you.

If you don't have the thought of benefiting your life, you won't make a wish to turn your body around.

If you don't turn around and have a good body, you can't lead sentient beings.

What does that mean? That is to say: if a practitioner does not have compassion, and his heart is the root, he will not be able to endure the suffering of cultivation;

If you cannot endure suffering, you will not be able to achieve the cause of benefiting sentient beings;

However, if you don’t even have the thought of benefiting and living beings, you won’t be able to take advantage of your vows to return and save all beings.

Therefore, only with compassion and compassion can one endure all kinds of cultivation and suffering, and finally be able to become a Buddha and save sentient beings in the six realms.

The size of bodhicitta depends on the size of compassion.

The speed at which Bodhisattvas cultivate and become Buddhas is also determined by the size of their compassion.

Some Bodhisattvas practice the tantric method and become Buddhas quickly. The same reason is because of the power of compassion.

Why don't Theravada Arhats save sentient beings? It is because of compassion and lack of heart, as long as you are happy, you can enter into concentration, into the blissful meditation.

Compassion is the most important method of Mahayana Buddhism. When you have compassion and compassion, you will have great power to save sentient beings, and you will surely come to save and transform sentient beings.

If there is a couple whose only child is seriously ill, they must have a strong sense of compassion for the child.

In this way, the greater the compassion, the greater the hope to save the child, and the more ways you can come up with, the greater the hope for the child to be saved.

The same is true for saving and removing sentient beings in the six realms. With great compassion, one will definitely save and rescue sentient beings in the six realms.

(2) How to express compassion and whether it can save sentient beings depends on how much compassion and heart one can express.

Whether you can express compassion or not depends on your understanding of the suffering of sentient beings. If you have a deep, broad, and strong understanding of the suffering of sentient beings in the six realms, you can easily express compassion.

Therefore, the root of cultivating compassion is to constantly think about the suffering of sentient beings.

Before contemplating the suffering of sentient beings, you must have a single, fixed feeling for the suffering. First, you must often contemplate your own suffering.

For example, you should always think: "My pain is so much, if I can get rid of it a lot, great! I can't bear so much pain, how can other beings be able to bear it?" Just think like this, from your own pain, When it is extended to other sentient beings, the experience of compassion will gradually arise.

Contemplate the pain of the three evil realms again.

Visualize the various sufferings beings in the lower realms are suffering: beings in the hell realm are burned with a red-hot iron plate and boiled in boiling hot iron;

Hungry ghosts, living beings are so hungry that their eyes are dimmed;

In the animal way, sentient beings are fearful and fearful, and suffer from the hardship of the weak and the strong, etc.

Then it can be extended to other sentient beings.

After generating compassion for the sentient beings in the three evil realms, then combine the content of the truth of suffering, and think about the sentient beings in the human and heavenly realms.

If you think about it, it will be clear, white: the sentient beings in the human and heavenly ways seem to be living well, because it is a matter of good fortune and retribution.

In fact, it is no different from a lamb to be slaughtered. It is about to be slaughtered without knowing it. It is just that the time of death is sequential, and sooner or later, it will fall into the evil realm. In fact, it is no different from having fallen into the evil realm. .

After contemplating the suffering of the six realms, then cultivate compassion and compassion for the mother in this life.

My mother did a lot of bad karma because she didn't understand the Dharma, and she's still doing it;

199

Although we try our best to be nice to her, she still suffers from the three sufferings.

Think again, all living beings in the six realms are ours, mother, and they are all suffering and creating the causes of suffering.

Therefore, we should, when we have compassion, contemplate the suffering of all beings, and at the same time make a vow: "It would be great if these mother beings could be freed from suffering and the causes of suffering! I must rescue these mother beings!"

Compassion can be divided into two types, the mother's compassion and the father's compassion.

The compassion that only wishes to stay away from pain is the compassion of the Shravaka, the Arhats, and it can also be called the compassion of the mother;

And the kind of compassion that sees the suffering of sentient beings, generates courage, and saves sentient beings is the compassion of the Mahayana, also known as the compassion of the father, and it is also the compassion that we need to generate.

Increase the sense of responsibility The responsibility here refers to the responsibility and responsibility of guiding sentient beings in the six realms to get rid of suffering and achieve happiness.
After developing compassion and compassion, the next step is to increase the responsibility, mind: All beings in the six realms are their own parents, and who is responsible for guiding the living beings in the six realms, to get rid of suffering and achieve happiness? It's mine, it's our responsibility.

We have to take on the responsibility of guiding sentient beings in the six realms to get rid of suffering and achieve happiness. The courage to take on this responsibility is to increase the sense of responsibility.

Arouse Bodhicitta (1) When arousing bodhicitta and great compassion, he has not yet initiated the sense of responsibility to guide the people, to be free from suffering and achieve happiness.
Now, we have decided, this, the responsibility is ours.

However, although I have the heart to take it, do I have the ability to take it? Think about it carefully, currently, there is no such ability.

Not to mention guiding sentient beings in the six realms, right now, he doesn't even have the ability to free his mother from suffering and achieve happiness.

Think again, just think, who has this ability? There are no Arhats, no ordinary Bodhisattva, no Sagittarius, and no Bodhisattva who has reached the ground. Only Buddhas have this ability.

Because the Buddha's ability is the greatest, the wisdom is the greatest, the blessings and retribution are the greatest, and the great compassion is also the greatest.

With these conditions and conditions, it is possible to save sentient beings in the six realms.

Therefore, in order for sentient beings in the six realms to be free from suffering and achieve happiness, we must first become Buddhas, and we must become Buddhas!

In order to save all sentient beings from suffering and achieve happiness, the mind that oneself wants to become a Buddha is called Bodhicitta.

Let’s emphasize the order of the seven causal factors to generate bodhicitta:

First, recognize that all sentient beings are mothers.

Second, I miss my mother.

Third, repay the mother's kindness.

Fourth, show mercy.

Fifth, show compassion.

Sixth, increase the sense of responsibility.

Seventh, develop Bodhicitta.

We will contemplate, contemplate, cultivate, and develop bodhicitta in this order.

In the process of developing bodhicitta, sometimes there will be that kind of occasional desire to become a Buddha, but most of the time in a state of distraction. This is not bodhicitta, it is greed.

To generate bodhicitta, you must think about the pain and suffering of all sentient beings in the six realms, not just yourself and one or two sentient beings around you. You must also realize that sentient beings in the six realms have only pain and no happiness.

There is no other way for sentient beings to be free from suffering and attain happiness in the Sixth Way. Only by becoming a Buddha, can we guide and save sentient beings in the Sixth Way. Therefore, we ourselves must become Buddhas!

So, what are the benefits of becoming a Buddha? This also needs to be clearly stated. If you don’t know what a Buddha is like, you will be obstructed and you will develop bodhicitta.

(2) The merits of the four bodies of the Buddha The merits of the body, speech, and mind of the Buddha have been discussed before, so let's talk about the merits of the four bodies of the Buddha.

The Buddha has four bodies, namely, the body of retribution, the body of incarnation, the body of law, and the body of self-nature.

1) The Buddha's Sambhogakaya The Buddha's Sambhogakaya is an eternal life, an immortal being with 32, 80, and 80 appearances.

Freed from birth, old age, sickness, and death, life is eternal, forever, and will not pass away.

There are five characteristics of sambhogakaya:

First, life is eternal.

Second, the appearance is solemn, with thirty-two appearances, eighty appearances, and solemn appearances.

Third, the family members are all Bodhisattvas in the ten places, and at least they are also Bodhisattvas who have landed on the ground.

Ordinary people's eyes cannot see the Sambhogakaya, the Mahayana sustenance, and the bodhisattvas who practice the path can't see it. Only bodhisattvas who see the path above can see it.

Fourth, only the Mahayana Dharma is taught, not the Hinayana.

Fifth, abide in the supreme tantric realm.

2) Incarnation of Buddha 203

The incarnation is the incarnation of the sambhogakaya, and the sambhogakaya can be incarnated in many, many kinds of incarnations.

These incarnations can be roughly divided into two categories: ordinary incarnations, and extraordinary incarnations.

Shakyamuni Buddha is the supreme incarnation of the Sambhogakaya. Why is it called the supreme incarnation? This is because some aspects of this incarnation are the same as the Sambhogakaya, for example, the appearance is very solemn, it possesses sixty-four, various kinds of merits, etc.

The karmic conditions for saving sentient beings and special incarnations are different.

There is harmony, the supreme incarnation has the karma of personal salvation, there is the teaching of the supreme avatar, the law has the karma, and there are holy objects such as the relic of the supreme incarnation, and the holy place of practice has the karmic karma.

When the supreme incarnation has finished saving and transmuting the sentient beings who have personally saved the karmic karma, the Sambhogakaya will take this extraordinary incarnation back, and the Buddha will appear in the world to pass away.

Some people do not understand the passing away of the Buddha, they think that the Buddha is dead, and that even the Buddha has no way to get rid of death, and it is useless to study the Buddha.

In fact, it is the supreme incarnation of the Buddha who passed away, and the Buddha's Sambhogakaya is eternal and immortal.

After the Buddha passed away, the Buddha's teachings can only survive for 5,500 years, that is to say, they can benefit sentient beings for 5,500 years.

During this period, those who study and practice the Buddhadharma are all sentient beings who have a karmic relationship with the Buddha's teachings. For example, for us now, after 5,500 years, the Buddhadharma will be extinct.

But also, there are sentient beings who have saved the karma with the Buddha's relic, they will save, make offerings, nourish the Buddha's relic, and receive the blessing of the relic. If these sentient beings and the Buddha

The karma of the relic is also exhausted, and the relic becomes a wish-fulfilling treasure.

When the supreme incarnation teaches sutras, both Mahayana and Hinayana scriptures will be taught.

Because Shakyamuni Buddha is a supreme incarnation, his retinue includes both Mahayana and Hinayana.

The Buddha's Sambhogakaya does not speak the Theravada scriptures.

Ordinary people don't even have the predestined fate and blessings to see the extraordinary incarnation, let alone the retribution body of a Buddha, so the Buddha turned into an ordinary person, and incarnates to teach and transform sentient beings.

What is an ordinary incarnation? That is to say, some sentient beings cannot see the Buddha's extraordinary incarnation. The Buddha just looks at these sentient beings and accepts whatever appearance they can accept, and transforms that appearance to save them.

For example, there is an allusion that a person was digging for medicinal herbs on the mountain, and accidentally fell into a deep cave and could not get out.

At this time, Manjushri Bodhisattva came to rescue him, but even if Manjusri Bodhisattva appeared and emerged from his true body, that person would definitely not be able to see it. If Manjusri Bodhisattva turned into a monk, or turned into an ordinary person, although he could see it, he could see it. But it's not normal.

As a result, Manjushri turned into a monkey, which is reasonable.

However, it is not enough to transform into a big, strong monkey. His blessings are not enough, but he can't accept it, so he can only transform into a weaker monkey, so that he will not be afraid when he sees it.

Then, he saw this every day, monkeys crawling around in the hole.

After a period of time, after he accepted this, the monkey signaled to carry him to the hole, he agreed, and the monkey carried him to the entrance of the hole.

205

At this time, he thought that he had not been home for a long time after digging for medicinal materials. If he went back empty-handed to his wife, he would scold him. It would be better to kill the monkey and bring its meat back.

Thinking of this, he picked up the hoe and hit the monkey. At this time, the monkey opened his mouth and said, "You, people are really hateful."

He was frightened away.

Sometimes, in order to save a sentient being, the Buddha may appear multiple times, but even so, sentient beings may not be able to see it.

There is a master Caiqin who is a practitioner of Dakini Buddha. From the moment he received it to the moment when Dakini was empowered, Dakini was like a shadow, following him all the time, but he could not see the void. Walk Buddha.

Although he practiced diligently, he still didn't feel anything, so he began to complain: "The blessing of the Dakini Buddha should be very powerful, but why did it not appear to me.

"One time, Cai Qin Da, the teacher went around the pagoda in a temple, and saw a devil with a very tall body and long fangs in his mouth.

When Master Caiqin saw the rear horse, he recited the Matou Mingwang Mantra to get rid of the devil. As he recited the mantra, the devil was getting farther and farther away from him.

At this time, a female voice came from the air: "I don't show you to blame me, show you, and exclude me."

This devil turned out to be a dakini, not a real devil or ghost.

The karma is inconceivable. When the Dakini Buddha appeared, she was applauded, but what the teacher saw was the devil.

From that day on, Master Caiqin's faith in Dakini became stronger and stronger. Not to mention his own master, he could even see ordinary living beings as Dakinis. This kind of strong His beliefs enabled him to eliminate a lot of karma.

Not long after, Master Caiqin rode to a certain place to practice the Dakini Buddha, mother.

On the way, a fire dragon came down from the sky, facing him, the horse's back rushed down.

He was very frightened, thinking about what this is, east, west, and when he turned around, it turned out to be Dakini, who was behind him, grabbed him tightly and said, "You can't exclude me today."

Talent, Master Qin has achieved this in his life.

Master Caiqin eventually became a great siddha, but in the process of his practice, he could not see or recognize the appearance of the Dakini Buddha.

Therefore, Buddhas and Bodhisattvas are everywhere. If our karma is light and our blessings are enough, we will see Buddhas and Bodhisattvas everywhere around us.

Now, our karma is very heavy. When the Buddha and Bodhisattva appear, it may be a mosquito or a cockroach. With our blessings, we can only see these.

When Buddhas and Bodhisattvas save sentient beings, they can have countless manifestations, thoughts, and manifestations, and they can manifest in an instant.

There is an island in India called Zanza Island. Why is it called Zanza Island? There was a master named Tsangzagomi, a lay disciple. He was very handsome, and he cultivated Tara.

When a king's daughter saw Zanzagomi, she said to her father, "I will marry this Zanzagomi as my husband. If I can't marry him, I will kill myself."

So the king ordered Zanzagomi to say: "You will be the son-in-law of the king! If you don't agree, I will destroy the Buddha and Dharma in your place." Zanzagomi had no choice but to temporarily agree.

When he arrived at the king's palace and saw the princess, he asked the princess, "What's your name?" The princess said, "My name is Darui." Darui means Tara.

He said: "Tara is my deity, how dare I marry this deity as an old woman? No!" The princess was very angry after hearing this: "You want to leave, me? Yes, I will let you leave."

He put him in a cowhide bag and threw it into the Ganges River. When the bag slowly sank, he stayed in the bag and recited Tara's salutation. At this time, the Green Tara appeared. After leaving an island, he rescued Zanzagomi and said to him: "You, you can practice here in the future."

The island was later called Zanza Island, and it still exists today.

3) The Buddha's Dharma Body is the Buddha's great wisdom and all knowledge.

Wisdom can be transformed into the body of a Buddha, so it is said that the wisdom of the Buddha is everywhere, and the Buddha is also everywhere.

4) The Buddha's Self-Nature Body Self-Nature Body is the Buddha's true body, the original appearance of the mind.

Because the self-nature body is the ultimate nirvana in which the self-nature is pure and the guest dust is pure, so after being fully enlightened, after realizing the ultimate nirvana, you will truly obtain the self-nature body.

At the same time, the Buddha has the merits of the four bodies.

After understanding the merits and virtues of the Buddha's four bodies, let's think about it again: Only when you become a Buddha can you have such merits and virtues, so as to motivate yourself to develop Bodhi, your mind will be more diligent, and you will get bodhicitta faster.

(2) Bodhicitta is generated by exchanging with others. Above are the seven causal factors that generate bodhicitta. Now, we will talk about exchanging with others and generating bodhicitta.

Shantideva Bodhisattva said in the Treatise on Entering the Way of the Bodhisattva:

If a person wants to get sick quickly, the rescue will be with him, and the secret formula should be cultivated, and the name will be replaced by him.

Compared with the seven-branch causal generation of bodhicitta, by cultivating self-exchange and generating bodhicitta, the awakening of bodhicitta is quicker and more courageous, and there are many, extraordinary merits and virtues.

209

Definition of Self-exchanged Bodhichitta What does it mean to "exchange" of self-exchanged Bodhichitta? , I don't mean to exchange with others, that's not what I mean.
It is to exchange our self-interests that love me and respect me to those who love him and respect him, and altruistic hearts.

Then change to increase the sense of responsibility, and then change to Bodhi, the mind, it is called the exchange of bodhicitta with others.

To benefit others, to respect others, to love others, is to have others and all living beings in your heart.

Use this kind of altruism to replace your self-interest.

Then I increased my sense of responsibility, and at the same time, I thought to myself: How can we save sentient beings? Only Buddhahood is possible.

The bodhicitta that arises at this time is the bodhicitta that arises from the exchange of others.

To develop this kind of heart, we must first know the dangers of self-interest.

In the Treatise on Entering Bodhisattva Actions, it says:

All suffering in the world comes from self-interest.

And said:

All disasters in the world, all fear and suffering,

Knowing that you are born from ego, what is the benefit of keeping this demon?

All the troubles and sufferings in our life are caused by ego.

The poisoning of swords and soldiers, the obstacles and infringements of heavenly dragons and evil spirits, and even being born in hell, hungry ghosts, animal realms, etc., all originate from the evil deeds such as killing for our own interests.

This is from the point of view of rebirth.

Then, in our daily life, all kinds of illnesses and pains in our body, all kinds of conflicts and troubles that occur, being persecuted and excluded at work, and even taking a lawsuit, violating the laws of the state, etc., are also due to egoism It is caused by the idea of ​​loving me, respecting me.

It can be said that everything from wars and strife between countries to conflicts between individuals, everything comes from self-interest and self-interest.

The main reason why bodhicitta is difficult to arise from exchanging with others is ego, attachment and selfishness.

Once, Master Gazang Qusong talked about the exchange of bodhicitta, and he talked for seven days.

He said: "Self-interest, love, I respect my thoughts, which are ghosts and demons. When you have such thoughts, you must think about how many times you have been harmed by this kind of thoughts, and you must be afraid of these thoughts and thoughts. , and to beat it.

When the heart of loving him and respecting him arises, praise yourself: 'Oh, that's right to think so'. "

Think again, why do Buddhas and Bodhisattvas have so many extraordinary merits and virtues? It is because Buddhas and Bodhisattvas respect all beings, love all beings, have interests, and have the hearts of all beings.

The Buddhist scriptures say, "What kind of karma is created, what kind of fruit is produced." Respecting others will also be loved and respected by others. This is a causal relationship.

Why does everyone naturally respect Buddhas and Bodhisattvas? It is also because Buddhas and Bodhisattvas love and respect all beings.

If we change our self-love to love others, and finally, we really have the heart to love all beings in the six realms, the result will be that all beings will love us, and we will fully understand, "What kind of karma is created, what kind of karma is born. fruit".

Similarly, "what kind of karma is created, what kind of fruit is produced", it can also be used to explain: as many sentient beings can be loved and respected, the number of sentient beings will be obtained, love and respect.

If we can love people all over the world, then people in the world will love us;

Able to love all living beings in the six realms, all living beings in the six realms will also love us;

If you can love those ghosts, demons, and grievances and creditors, they will not harm us, and they will love us, such as Master Langri Tangpa as mentioned earlier.

Why do these ghosts, demons, who live by harming people, when they encounter a bodhisattva, not only do they not harm the bodhisattva, but they also make offerings? The reason is very simple. They are also one of the sentient beings. Therefore, the Bodhisattva has compassion for them, loves them, and will not harm them. They can also feel it.

When Venerable Atisha first came to Tibet, many monks were there, and their families went to greet him.

Everyone saw Venerable Atisha, who kept clasping their palms together and bowing their heads humbly.

Everyone said, "Ah! The masters will respect us."

Because Venerable Atisha respects all people, so after Venerable went to Tibet, everyone liked him.

And you should love him and respect him.

When we look at everything around us, all beings are serving us and helping us.

That is to say, sentient beings are not only gracious to us when they are our mothers;

When we are not our mothers, we still have to rely on them to survive.

For example, for food, we need someone to plant it, water it, and make it before we can eat it;

The house that I live in is also, yes, although I bought it with my own money, someone needs to build it. After I live in it, someone needs to serve me. Otherwise, the garbage will be piled up in the sky.

This is especially true in practice. We can obtain a life full of life, value, meet a teacher, have the opportunity to practice, and become a Buddha. Everything depends on the kindness of sentient beings.

Because sentient beings are the objects of our aspirations, and they are the objects of cultivating the six perfections and ten thousand deeds, especially those who practice generosity, precepts, and patience.

Therefore, in the Treatise on Entering Bodhisattva Actions, it says:

Sentient beings and all Buddhas can produce the Buddhadharma together,

If you respect the Buddha, why not respect the sentient beings?

We can cultivate and become Buddhas, half of which is the kindness of the guru and the Three Jewels, and the other half is the kindness of sentient beings.

Master Langri Tangpa also said:

I regard all sentient beings as more than wish-fulfilling treasures

To be able to achieve special victories, may you always love and persevere!

When we understand this, we will be more firm in our hearts of loving, respecting and living.

If a person does everything for himself, the people around him will think that this person is greedy and won’t get everyone’s support.

However, when a person's heart is all about how to benefit others, he will naturally get everyone's support.

After understanding this truth, it is easier for him to exchange with self-cultivation.

When cultivating love and respect for him, you should be the same as when cultivating your heart before. Start with your own parents or loved ones, then gradually, you will love and respect the people around you, and finally you will love and respect all sentient beings.

The practice of self-exchanged bodhicitta When cultivating self-exchanged bodhicitta, one must first cultivate the seven branches of karma, the first five parts of bodhichitta.
Then practice self-exchange in the way of visualization, and visualize using various kinds of altruism to replace the self-interest of loving me and respecting me, and then change it to increase the sense of responsibility, and then change it to bodhicitta.

When visualizing, there are many aspects to exchange:

Exchange your own happiness with the pain of others

Your health is exchanged for the sickness of others,

Exchange your abilities for the incompetence of others,

Exchange your wisdom with the ignorance of others,

Exchange your good fortune with the karma of others,

exchange one's own merits for another's faults,

Exchange your own happiness with the troubles of others.

When meditating, visualize the above-mentioned happiness, wisdom, blessings, etc., which will become immeasurable white light, emanating from your right nostril, entering the left nostril of beings in the six realms, and then visualizing that all beings in the six realms have obtained, very Great happiness and good fortune.

Then visualize the karma and afflictions of the above-mentioned beings in the six realms, etc., all of which turn into black air, flow out from the right nostril of the six realms, inhale it through your left nostril, and visualize hitting your ego and destroy it. ego.

This is the meditation method of exchanging bodhicitta with others.

If you often meditate in this way, you will feel that you have accepted the karma and illness of others.

After accepting this, the body will get sick, but because of the power of bodhicitta, this sickness will eventually be eliminated.

In the past, very, very few people in Tibet had serious illnesses such as cancer. It was because there were many masters with relatively great achievements who often practiced and exchanged bodhicitta with others, and exchanged the suffering of sentient beings, which prevented many people from getting cancer.

There used to be a tumor disease in Tibetan areas, that is, a tumor growing on the neck, especially in Guide County, Qinghai. This disease is common and widespread.

Later, Guide produced a great siddhi master Taxiu. He often exchanged bodhicitta from him and sucked the tumors of all living beings. Finally, a large tumor grew on his neck. Since then, there will be no more tumors there. This disease has never occurred.

Master Taxiu practiced for a few more years, and after a few years, his illness gradually recovered. This is the power of self-exchange of bodhicitta.

Once, when Shangpa Rinpoche was teaching the scriptures, there was a dog walking around constantly, his waiter hit the dog with a stick, but the dog didn't respond. a sound.

After speaking, Shangpa Rinpoche said to the attendant, "You beat me so hard today!" The attendant saw that Shangpa Rinpoche's neck was swollen. Only at a certain level, there are magical abilities.

Master Langri Tangba's face was dark every day, all day long, with a sad look.

Someone asked: "Why does the master do this every day?" He said: "I have to exchange the troubles of sentient beings every day, how can I not frown? In fact, I am very happy."

, Geshe Chekwa, a disciple of the master of Kadampa Xayavar, in the west, Tibet is known as the Dharma King of Leprosy.

In the past, there was no cure for leprosy. Later, Geshe Che Kawa taught these lepers to practice the Three Ways and Self, and he exchanged bodhicitta.

For the newly arrived leper, Geshe Che Kawa, exchanged with him, and he would have acne on his body, and the patient would just, well, everyone thinks this master's method is to cure leprosy.

In fact, what Geshe Che Kawa taught them was the Three Ways, especially the Bodhicitta of Self-exchange in the Three Ways.

After the lepers recovered, they continued to practice self-exchange bodhicitta. In the end, most of them were accomplished.

When cultivating self-exchange, always think about the faults of loving me, respecting me, self, and selfishness.

In the past, when the great siddhas in Tibet thought of this, they would repent and say, "My sins are so great!"

Once, one of the great siddhas of the Kagyu School, Tse, Tanjiechen Pa was seriously ill.

Zhiba Genle was also a great siddhis. When he learned that Zhe and Tanjie Chinpa were ill, he thought there was a demonic obstacle, so he made one, and the Great Toma came to exorcise the demons.

When exorcising demons, in general, after reciting the exorcism, rituals, and sending Doma outside, it ends.

However, this time, it was different. Zhiba Genle took the Doma and went outside for a while, and then brought the Doma back and said to Zhe, Tanjie Chinpa, "I can't find any demons outside. , the devil should be in your heart, it is the inner devil."

Then throw this big torma on the stomach of Tse-Tanje Chinpa.

The next day, Teh-Tangye Chinpa got better.

Therefore, if you really have a demon, it is the demonic hindrance generated by your own mind, that is, the ego-clinging generated by loving and respecting me.

There is another allusion.

Once upon a time, there was a man named Zahu Nu, and he took this name because after his brother died, a master said, taking a woman's name is easy to survive, so his mother gave him this name.

Nv Zahu is a businessman. This time he wants to go to sea to do business, but his mother is worried about him and does not want him to go.

His mother begged him, but he didn't listen. Finally, he made up his mind, stepped over his mother's body, and left.

The boat overturned after going to sea, he grabbed a board and floated to the sea.

After going ashore, I saw a big house, and there was a "humming" sound from inside. After opening the door, I saw a tall, big man with an iron wheel stuck in his head, and he kept going. During the turn, blood and brains flowed out, but this person did not die, and was still eating these things.

He was almost scared to death when he saw it. At this time, a voice came from the air: "Whoever comes here will suffer."

Then, the iron wheel jumped up and inserted it into the head of the woman with the beard.

At this time, he suddenly remembered: he did not listen to his mother's words, but also crossed her mother's body.

Knowing that this must be retribution, he thought again: "Because of my selfishness, I don't care about my mother, so I have received such retribution. There are many people like me in the world, and I am willing to bear their pain.

I vow that from now on, no one will come here to suffer. "

After making this vow, the iron wheel turned on his head for seven days, and after seven days he died, but because, in order to exchange the merits of bodhicitta from him, the woman Qahu was reborn after her death for thirty-three days.

This is an allusion from the time when Buddha Shakyamuni was an ordinary man before he became a Buddha.

The Qahu girl only knew self-interest and abandoned her mother. Until later, she realized the danger of selfishness and made a vow to replace him. People suffer this kind of suffering.

If you change your mentality, you will be reborn after only seven days of suffering, thirty-three days, otherwise, you may suffer for more than seven years.

The 29th day of the twelfth lunar month is the most special day for exorcising demons. Son, if the exorcism on this day is complete, the next year will be peaceful and safe.

Therefore, the monasteries in the Tibetan area make platoons every year on the 29th of the twelfth lunar month.

Master Longdu said: "Everyone exorcises demons, and all they do are expel demons from outside, but they can't expel demons in themselves.

Do you have the ability to force Toma to help me get rid of the devil in my heart? "

What is the devil within us? It is love, respect, selfishness, self-interest.

The above is about generating bodhicitta.

219

Section 2 After the ten paramitas have aroused bodhicitta, they are bodhisattvas.

What a bodhisattva wants to cultivate is the six degrees and four absorptions, and the six degrees are also called the six paramitas, including: cloth, paramita of application, paramita of keeping precepts, paramita of tolerance, paramita, essence, paramita of meditation, paramita of meditation, and paramita of wisdom.

For example, if you add the Paramita of Wish, Paramita of Convenience, Paramita of Strength, and Paramita of Wisdom.

It's ten degrees.

Paramito is a transliteration, meaning "to the other shore", and also meaning, translated as "degree", and degree means crossing.

The so-called "other shore" means the "nirvana shore" that sentient beings reach after liberation.

1. Giving Paramita The essence of giving is equanimity. Giving without the spirit of equanimity is not considered as real giving, so pay attention to cultivating this kind of heart.

There are three kinds of giving packages: Dharma giving, wealth giving, and fearless giving.

(1) Wealth cloth uses wealth to help sentient beings, thereby accumulating his own blessings, food, and wealth giving.

When sentient beings need wealth, we have to give, no matter what the object is, giving will have merit.

Some people say that some of the people who ask for money on the street are liars, and there is no merit in giving money to liars.

It is not right to say that, yes, even if the other party is a liar, as long as we use the heart of equanimity, or the heart of bodhicitta to give, there is still merit.

Wealth giving includes making offerings to the Three Jewels, giving to the poor, charitable donations, etc.

Doing wealth and giving is the real meaning of wealth, and it can also accumulate great blessings.

For example, if you donate to build a Buddha statue, as long as the Buddha statue exists, it can produce good fortune day, night, and night for as long as possible. Even if the person who donated it dies, but because the Buddha statue is still there, it will accumulate good fortune in the next life. .

The same goes for monks.

When the three masters including Bodova of Kadampa practiced generosity, one often offered incense and burned incense;

One builds temples, builds, Buddha statues;

The other one often makes offerings to the monks. These are the best three ways to make money and give.

Then Master Bodova said: "Some people's money was burned (offering incense);

Some people's money has become a house (built a temple);

My money was put in the mouth of the sambo with teeth (for monks). "

This, the Tibetan text of the paragraph sounds very interesting.

What the master meant was that the blessings of offering to monks surpassed other blessings, because offering monks had two kinds of merit, virtue, merit of offering and merit of receiving.

Although everyone's life in this life is determined by the karma of the previous life, it can be changed in this life.

221

If you have done a lot of bad karma in the past life, and caused the bad karma in this life, you can change it by doing more generosity in this life and accumulating more blessings.

Therefore, we should do more good deeds, deeds, and charity.

Seeing where there is a disaster, even a small donation is a good donation.

(2) Dharma Dharma printed scriptures, Dharma books, CD-ROMs printed and taught, and Dharma requests are all Dharma Dharma offerings.

When you have the ability to preach the scriptures, you can teach the scriptures and spread the Dharma. This is also Dharma giving.

When you don't have this ability for the time being, you can also use other methods to practice almsgiving.

For example, in front of you, visualize Sakyamuni, and Buddha Muni's heart emits a white light, welcoming sentient beings in the six realms, and then reciting the Heart Sutra to give them Dharma alms.

This is done with the practice of visualization, Dharma giving.

(3) Fearless giving to sentient beings has all kinds of horrors. To save sentient beings from fear is nothingness, fearless giving, and the result of fearless giving is health and longevity.

For example, releasing life is fearless giving, and it is the best fearless giving.

In particular, the release also has three kinds of generosity at the same time.

When releasing life, you need to chant scriptures and recite the rituals of releasing life, which is Dharma giving.

When reciting the liberating ritual, it is best to recite the holy names of the Eight Tathagatas, the Thirty-Five Buddhas, and the Eight Great Bodhisattvas, and then recite the mantra of transcendence seven times, especially the names of the Buddhas that cannot be recited.

As long as sentient beings hear the Buddha’s name seven times, they will surely plant the seeds of liberation, they will also be liberated, leave the three evil paths, and obtain the fruit of human and heaven.

Then recite the Heart Sutra again, listen to the Heart Sutra, and plant the seeds of 84,000 Dharma-doors, which is very, very extraordinary.

Reciting scriptures is the greatest significance of releasing life, and at the same time, it is also the practice of dharma giving, so it is necessary to recite scriptures when releasing life.

If the released animals were bought with money, this is the offering of wealth, giving.

To release life and save the lives of sentient beings is to give without fear.

Dedication after the release is also very important, especially if you can return to your own guru or a great accomplished person, you can live in the world forever and turn constantly, the Wheel will have great merit and great blessings.

Performing the three kinds of generosity will get different results.

If you practice wealth, you will get wealth, if you practice Dharma, you will gain wisdom. If you practice fearlessly, you will live a long and healthy life.

(4) The Six Right and Six Degrees of Giving When giving paramitas, it is very important to have the six right and six qualities.

223

The Six Righteousness is righteousness, righteousness of things, righteousness of conduct, righteousness of the main law, righteousness of devotion, and righteousness of purification.

The righteousness of reliance is the righteousness of reliance.

The thing is to give without reservation.

When doing righteous giving, it is not for one sentient being, but for all, all sentient beings, that is right conduct.

No matter what kind of almsgiving you perform, it must penetrate the wisdom of being selfless, no, you must not let go of greed.

Don't be attached to the wealth you donate, and don't be attached to the Dharma, or the object of the donation.

Dedication is dedicating the merit of giving to liberation and becoming a Buddha, which is devotion to right.
After performing almsgiving, one should not only dedicate "self and family members to health and longevity", but also to "six sentient beings liberated and attained Buddhahood, free from suffering and attained happiness".

If the devotion is not right, the merit will be reduced.

For example, if you dedicate merit to your family, if there are five or six people in your family, you will get as much merit.

However, if you dedicate your devotion to sentient beings in the six realms, there are innumerable sentient beings in the six realms, and the resulting merits are immeasurable, and after devoting the devotion to sentient beings, the merits and virtues obtained by your family members will not decrease.

To purify the righteousness of giving is to break the obstacles of affliction and knowledge, that is, to purify the righteousness.
The above are the six principles of generosity.

The Six Righteousness and Six Degrees of Giving means that when one performs almsgiving, one must possess the Six Righteousness and at the same time possess the Six Degrees of Righteousness.

Six degrees is what we usually call six degrees, that is, six paramitas, many.

When performing almsgiving, the precepts must be pure, and words and deeds must not be disordered;

It is also necessary to endure humiliation. For example, when releasing a life, if someone does not understand and says three or four, then one must endure the humiliation and not quarrel;

It is necessary to be diligent, to do and let go, to be unstoppable in life, and to be diligent in order to progress;

You also need to have meditation, at the very least, you must have concentration, so that you can do things completely and successfully;

There is also need, wisdom, and wisdom to distinguish between dos and don'ts, and to have the ability to solve problems.

225

Therefore, in order to be able to give consummately, it is necessary to have the six right and six degrees at the same time.

The almsgiving with the six perfections and six perfections is Paramita. Without it, the six perfections and six perfections can only be called ordinary dana, not really Paramita.

The six righteousness and six degrees of generosity are very important. When I was cultivating the three monks and Taoism, I forgot to cultivate this part, so I continued to cultivate the next part.

In the evening, I had a dream. In the dream, Master Bodova said to me, "You, there is a part of you that you haven't cultivated."

I said, "No, right?" The master said again, "Bu, you forgot about the six perfections and six degrees of Shi."

I just remembered.

The same is true when cultivating other paramitas. When keeping the precepts, you should pay attention to the six perfections and six perfections. When practicing forbearance, you also need six perfections and six perfections.

(5) The dharma door of Xian Zong of loving kindness and generosity teaches three kinds of generosity, while the method of Tantric Buddhism teaches four kinds of generosity, and there is one kind of generosity.

Loving charity is giving, giving loving kindness, and often giving loving kindness to sentient beings in the six realms.

First of all, visualize your body as a wish-fulfilling treasure, that is, the wish-fulfilling jewel among the seven treasures of the Wheel King, a kind of treasure that can be obtained by asking for anything, and what can be wished for;

Then, visualize the transformation in the body, and there will be wish-fulfilling treasures in the same amount as sentient beings in the six realms;

Then visualize each sentient being and get a wish-fulfilling jewel, and the wish-fulfilling jewel manifests the things that all sentient beings need.

Finally, visualize every sentient being as wishful and full of joy. This is charitable giving.

2. The essence of keeping the Paramita precepts is the heart to renounce evil.

If you don't have the will and consciousness to cut off evil, even if you don't do evil, it's not considered to be keeping the precepts.

There are three kinds of precepts: forbidden precepts, precepts of benefiting sentient beings, and precepts of taking good deeds.

(1) Abstinence Abstinence refers to what you want to forbid in body, speech, and mind, which will lead to creation.

Wicked words, deeds and thoughts.

There are three prohibitions on the body: killing, stealing, and sexual misconduct.

There are four taboos in speaking: lying, double tongue, foul speech, and flattering speech.

The mind is the mind, and there are three precepts: greed, hatred, and wrong views.

The precepts of not liberating are all taboos.

What does the precept of not liberation mean? Most of the precepts stipulated are for liberation. Yes, the root of liberation is called the precept of liberation.

Don't liberate the novice in the precepts, the precepts, the monk precepts, the monks' precepts, the five precepts of the lay family, the eight Theravada precepts, and the fasting precepts are all taboos.

227

The five precepts are often observed by family members of the eight-pass fasting, and some people may also be subject to the eight-pass fasting.
The eight-pass fast is a precept that is very suitable for family members to uphold.

It is divided into two types: the eight-pass fast of Hinayana and the eight-pass fast of Mahayana.

The eight-point fasting of Theravada has a specific date of keeping the precepts, on the first, fifteenth, thirty, or some other time of the month.

The master decided that at which time the disciples should keep the precepts, and there is no mistake.

Generally, it must be held on the eighth and fifteenth day of every month.

Mahayana's eight-pass fasting is different from that of Theravada. When taking the precepts for the first time, a teacher needs to pass the precepts. After the precepts are passed, from the second time, you can take precepts by yourself in front of the Buddha statue.

There are eight precepts in the Eight Passes Fasting: Do not kill, do not steal, do not commit sexual misconduct, do not lie, do not drink alcohol, do not eat, do not sleep on high beds, do not sing, dance, and make up.

These eight precepts, when you want to start taking them, you can choose that day to take the precepts.

You can decide how long you want to keep the precepts. If you want to take it for a month, you can take it for a month, you can take it for a year, you can take it for a few hours, and you can decide how long you want to take it.

Not eating after noon means not being able to eat after noon.

Specifically, the exact time is noon, depending on how long the local day is.

If the day lasts for twelve hours, then after twelve noon it is noon.

Summer days in Tibetan areas are very long. The sun sets at night, at nine o'clock. People usually eat lunch at around two in the afternoon, so noon is considered to be over after two o'clock.

On the day of keeping the precepts, it is not past noon, but it is not allowed to eat. The Mahayana fasting of the eight stages also requires fasting, and the Hinayana is not necessarily.

If you don't sleep on a high or wide bed, you cannot sit or sleep on a bed that is too high, too wide, or made of precious material during the period of keeping the precepts.

The height of the bed should not exceed the forearm, and the material should not be too expensive.

During the eight stages of fasting, they usually lay something on the ground and fall asleep.

Can't sing and dance, wear makeup, but can wash.

The eight stages of fasting are very suitable for family members to practice.

There are two kinds of eight-point fasts. Among the precepts, the Mahayana's eight-point fasting is a common precept for monks and laypeople. Both monks and laypeople can practice it. Some masters even take it in their entire life and keep the Mahayana's eight-point fasting.

The Eight Precepts of Theravada are the precepts of the home and family, which can be passed on from monks to laymen, but monks cannot do it by themselves.

If a monk cultivates the precepts of a layman, he will break the precepts of a monk and become a layman.

The eight-pass fasting is very easy to uphold. After taking the precepts, even if you keep the precepts for a day, you will have immeasurable merits, and even an hour will have great merits.

Especially on auspicious days, such as the Buddha's birthday, the day when the Buddha turns the Wheel, or the days when a guru or a great achiever is born or passed away, these days are more blessed, and it is more extraordinary to accept and uphold the eight precepts.

During the eclipse of the sun and the moon, if you practice the eight-point fasting, your merit will also increase very, very fast.

If the lunar eclipse lasts for an hour, in this hour, if you practice diligently and keep the precepts, your merit will increase one hundred thousand times;

When a solar eclipse is more severe and powerful, the merit will increase by a million times, because when a solar or lunar eclipse occurs, the body's central veins will open a little more than usual, so the increase in merit will be bigger.

In retreating practice, you will gain some special merits and wisdom, and thus produce some very special convenient methods.

Manjusri Bodhisattva has a special pea wisdom method, because during the solar eclipse, the merit and virtue increase very fast, so during the solar eclipse, hold a pea or pea in the mouth, and recite the Manjushri mantra all the time. If the faith is strong enough If it is big, if you read it to the end, the peas in your mouth will sprout, and if you eat it, you will grow in wisdom.

There are many similar methods. When practicing the methods of breathing, increasing, and cherishing, especially the method of cultivating love, when you practice during a solar eclipse, a lunar eclipse, or during auspicious days, the achievement will be faster.

(2) Benefiting sentient beings and precepts of benefiting sentient beings are the precepts of benefiting sentient beings. There are eleven rules:

Give help to those in need, and help those in need.
For example, yes, if we need financial help, if we have the financial ability, we must help each other financially;

When someone else is ill, they need to pay to help him.

Help anyone who needs help.

During the puja, there will be many people in need of help. At this time, it is very good to be able to do volunteer work, and the merit will be great. Even if you don't participate in the practice, you can still get the merit of the puja.

Applying skillful methods to ignorant beings, ignorant beings refer to those who do not understand cause and effect, and who do not distinguish between black and white.
For those who don't know how to be a human being, we should skillfully talk about some ways to be a human being.

For example, tell him, "Be upright, have a large heart, a large amount, and a peaceful mind.

Be filial to your parents, respect the elderly, and take care of the people and children around you. "

And so on like a man, the truth.

For those who do not understand Buddhism and Dharma, you can teach them the benefits of Dharma, for example, reciting the Four Refuges can accumulate blessings, make money, etc., so that they can be introduced into Buddhism.

Applying skillful methods to ignorant beings is also a precept.

To cultivate the bodhisattva way, these are the myriad actions of the bodhisattva, the actions of the bodhisattva, and they are all things we should do.

231

Those who have kindness to repay their kindness to themselves should repay their kindness doubled.
This is also the principle of being a human being in the world. If you are ungrateful, you are not even qualified to be an ordinary person, how can you cultivate the Bodhisattva Way and save sentient beings.

For those who encounter fear, help to eliminate fear. For example, if someone is afraid of ghosts, tell him not to be afraid, and then teach him to recite the mantras that can exorcise demons, such as King Matou Mingwang and Vajra King Kong, or recite the Heart Sutra.
To comfort and teach him these methods, in order to eliminate his fears.

When someone is attacked by snakes, wolves and other animals, they must also act decisively to save them.

Do whatever is beneficial to sentient beings. This is the behavior of a bodhisattva.

There was a Geshe named Santuo who saw that someone was stealing his own things, and his disciples were going to stop him. He said, "Leave him alone, let him take it if he needs it."

Then Geshe Santuo made a vow: "He took my things, which means that he has a fate with me. After I become a Buddha, the first one will save him."

All things that are beneficial to all beings must be done, and all beings must not be feared.

If someone stole something from us, we would immediately shout, "Ah, someone stole something!" Even though it was wrong for him to steal something, doing so would scare him.

A real Bodhisattva would be like Geshe Shen and Tuo, who would use skillful methods to stop and educate him.

No matter what kind of fear sentient beings have, those who practice the Bodhisattva path should help them, and all sentient beings will be eliminated.

For those who are in grief to help relieve their grief, we must help and relieve their grief.
For example, if one knows that a certain sentient being is uncomfortable and acts, the Bodhisattva Taoist will help him resolve this state of mind.

To those who are poor and to those who have a very difficult life, they must do their best to give, to them.

Food and lodging should be given to those who have nowhere to live.

Those who have the ability to build houses and tents should try their best to accommodate them. This is also the behavior of the Bodhisattva.

Now, there are many places in China that are building houses for the poor. This is the Bodhisattva action of the leaders of the country, and it is a very great good deed.

To be obedient means not to be too stubborn, to be obedient as much as possible without endangering others, not violating or breaking the precepts, and to make the people happy.

Those who should be encouraged should give encouragement and those who should be encouraged should encourage each other a lot.

In learning, we must encourage, and in work, study, and cultivation, we must also encourage. This is also what people who practice the Bodhisattva way should do.

Those who should be punished should be punished. Those who should be punished should be punished.
How to punish it? Curse those who should be scolded, and hit those who should be beaten, but no, it can be mixed with hatred, or else the precepts will be broken.

In the monastery, if the monk's precepts are not clean, the monastery will punish him or expel him.

In many monasteries in Tibetan areas, monks who break the precepts seriously will be expelled. Generally, they will be punished to do prostrations and worship.

In fact, any punishment is a way of accumulating blessings.

The essence of punishment is to save people. On the one hand, it is to prevent continued evil, and on the other hand, it is to accumulate blessings.

Those who need to use supernatural powers to subdue use supernatural powers. For some sentient beings who need to be subdued, if there is no other way, the only way is to use supernatural powers to subdue them, and they can show supernatural powers.
For example, it is not necessary to show supernatural powers at will.

There is a kind of demon called the Devil of the Son of Heaven, who likes to trick people with supernatural powers. For example, if practitioners often talk about supernatural powers and show supernatural powers, they will be tricked and calculated by the Devil of the Son of Heaven, and hinder their achievement.

When Tianzi Demon sees people who like to show off their gods, they will seduce them, sometimes making them rich, sometimes making them predict things accurately, and sometimes making them embarrassed. will become more and more obsessed with magic.

In the end, the people around these people are smoky, and they are getting worse and worse in all aspects, the discipline is getting worse, the compassion is getting worse, the behavior is getting worse, and eventually they will go to hell.

If a cultivator is below the Eighth Earth Bodhisattva, the Demon of the Son of Heaven will come to obstruct him, and when he reaches the Eighth Earth, the Demon of the Son of Heaven will not come.

Many people like to get supernatural powers, and also like to cultivate supernatural powers.

In fact, there is nothing special about supernatural powers. Once you have reached a certain level of cultivation, you will naturally have supernatural powers when you attain certain achievements.

If you don't reach that level, the pursuit of supernatural powers and the acquisition of supernatural powers will be a curse.

Very, it is easy to go crazy, become crooked, and become evil.

Therefore, Master Tsongkhapa said that showing supernatural powers at will is a breach of precepts. You cannot show supernatural powers easily, but only when you have to.

The Mahavira Hall of Drepung Monastery is also called auspicious multi-door. Why is it called this name, what is it? In the past, when Master Tsongkhapa talked about emptiness in Drepung Monastery, thousands of his disciples realized emptiness. , After realizing emptiness, it will remove some karmic obstacles and be able to pass through certain obstacles, for example, to pass through walls.

Therefore, in the morning class, many masters who went to the Mahavira Hall did not go through the main entrance, but got in from all sides, as if there were one door everywhere, so it was called auspicious multi-door.

Later, an old man came to worship the Buddha. At this time, a monk got out of the Buddha statue and scared the old man.

From then on, Master Tsongkhapa set the rules, not to be chaotic, to show supernatural powers, and to go through the main door, if you don't go to the main door, you are breaking the precepts.

These are the precepts for benefiting all living beings.

(3) What are the Dharma Precepts of Preserving Goodness? Doing all good deeds is regarded as a precept, a discipline, which is called the precept of good deeds.

The Dharma Precepts of Receiving Good include the good precepts and the Bodhisattva Precepts among the six paramitas.

For example, the precepts of monks, tantric precepts, and bodhisattva precepts, etc., all belong to the precepts of the good law.

As for the precepts of monks, the precepts of monks cannot be taught to them before they become monks;

As for the tantric vows, before receiving empowerment, some tantric vows can be preached, but most of them cannot be taught.

Regarding the Bodhisattva Precepts, there is a little difference between the Bodhisattva Precepts in Tibetan Buddhism and those in Chinese.

There are eighteen fundamental precepts in Tibetan Bodhisattva Precepts. The main thing is to cultivate the fundamental precepts. The fundamental precepts must be pure.

Before taking the bodhisattva precepts, you can speak and learn.

When you want to take the precepts, you must yourself, you must think clearly, if you can keep the precepts cleanly after taking the precepts, then you can take the Bodhisattva precepts again.

The following is a detailed explanation of the Bodhisattva Precepts in Tibetan Buddhism.

Tibetan Buddhism Bodhisattva Precepts, (1) Self-praise and destroy him in order to gain the offerings and respect of others. If a person often praises himself, he will easily lie, and also, it will damage other merits, and even go crazy.
Therefore, self-praise has become a commandment.

The reason to destroy him is to gain support and respect from him and others. However, if you fabricate someone else's fault and make him bear his sins, it is also called destroying him, such as wrongfully accusing others of breaking precepts.

This kind of self-praise done in order to gain the offerings and respect of others, and destroying others, is a serious breach of the bodhisattva precepts, and a general degree is not considered a breach of precepts.

(2) If you do not give gifts, you know that the other party is helpless and needs help, but because of stinginess or other reasons, you do not give dharma or wealth, even if you break this precept.

If it is because of lack of time and other reasons, it is not considered a fundamental precept for breaking this precept.

(3) Do not listen to repentance. For some reason, when the other party repents and apologizes, those who take the Bodhisattva precepts must understand.

If you do not forgive because you hold grudges, you are breaking this precept.

If you don't hold grudges, just for the sake of face, etc., you don't have to violate this precept.

(4) Abandoning the Mahayana teachings and abandoning the Mahayana expedient and wisdom of the perfect harmony method, even if you violate this precept.

A single method of abandoning Mahayana expedients or wisdom is not counted, and this precept is violated.

(5) To seize the wealth of the Three Jewels is to seize the wealth of the Three Jewels of Buddha, Dharma and Sangha.

Stealing the offerings in front of the Buddha is the wealth of stealing the Buddha's treasure;

Stealing the scriptures and offerings before the Dharma book is the wealth of stealing magic treasures;

Stealing the stupas or bodhisattvas, the former offerings, is to steal the treasures of the monks.

Stealing the belongings of the monks is also, stealing the treasures of the monks.

Taking possessions of the Three Jewels violates this precept.

Therefore, one cannot steal offerings for the Three Jewels.

However, if you want to eliminate karma and get blessings, you can eat and offer offerings.

As stated in the tantric Essays:

Tathagata's leftovers are used to eliminate karma.

(6) The slandering of the Dharma 

slandered the Theravada people's selfless wisdom and the thirty-seven dharmas of the convenient and harmonious method, the Mahayana wisdom of emptiness and compassion, and other convenient and perfect methods, the method of fusion, the tantric emptiness and the unique wisdom and harmony. The four great joys are convenient for the Dharma door of perfection and harmony, and slandering any kind of Dharma door of perfection and harmony is a violation of this, precept.

Slandering one of the wisdom and convenient methods is not a violation of this precept, but there is a crime of slandering the method.

Eighty-four thousand dharmas are all preached by Buddha Shakyamuni, and the Buddhist teachings of the Southern, Tibetan, and Chinese traditions are also taught by Buddha Shakyamuni, and none of them can be slandered.

If some people do things wrong, it's a human problem, not a law problem.

For example, some people in Theravada are not doing it right, it may be because some masters are not good at teaching, but it cannot be based on that, and it is said that Theravada is not good.

We need to follow the law rather than people, and we need to distinguish between people and the law.

If some masters did wrong, it doesn't mean that Buddhism is wrong.

For example, in Tibetan Buddhism, some monks have done something wrong, which does not mean Tibetan Buddhism is wrong;

Some of the monks who were passed down from the Han did not do it properly, and they were not Han, and they were not right to teach the Buddhadharma.

Many masters have afflictions. His wrong words and deeds are caused by afflictions, not created according to the law. Therefore, absolutely, they cannot slander the Buddhadharma.

In addition, the sin of slandering the Buddhadharma is very, very serious, and it will cause extremely severe pain. We must pay attention to it, be especially careful.

(7) Taking the cassock is the act of taking away the cassock of a family member.

This phenomenon is almost gone now. In the past, when the Buddha was alive, some outsiders saw Buddhist monks and went to grab the monks' robes.

In the past, some poor people in India saw the cassocks worn by monks, and they would rob them if they were good, so they had the commandment against stealing cassocks.

(8) Five unrelenting sins 

The five unrelenting sins are killing the father, mother, an Arhat, breaking the harmony, merging with the Sangha, and spitting out the blood of the Buddha's body with disgust.

If you commit the five uninterrupted sins, you will commit this precept.

(9) Wrong view 

Wrong view refers to not believing in cause and effect, rebirth, and the Three Jewels. Of these three, any one of the wrong views violates this precept.

Other wrong views are generally inverted concepts, for example, what is originally good is regarded as bad, and what is bad is regarded as good;

What originally exists thinks it does not exist, does not exist, and what exists thinks it exists, etc.

(10) Destruction of a village, etc. 

Destroying the living place of more than four households is a ruined village. Doing so will break this precept. As for other people's residences, if we are able, we must do our best to help them build and maintain them without destroying them.

If there is demolition, it is reasonable and lawful to help him relocate, comfort him with kind words, and resettle him well.

(11) Showing emptiness to immaturity 

If you know that someone is an immature root of emptiness, it is still true. He preaches emptiness, which makes him suspicious of the Three Jewels.

If you do this, you will break this precept.

For those who understand and accept emptiness before the time has come, if they talk about true emptiness, after hearing it, they may fall into stubborn emptiness, cling to severance, and stop seeing.

After clinging to this wrong view, you will not recognize cause and effect, rebirth, and believe that everything will be destroyed after death.

In this way, greed, hatred, and delusion will be driven to destroy all good virtues and increase all evil deeds, which is very scary.

After Venerable Atisha went to the Tibetan area, he saw that almost everyone in the Tibetan area would recite the Heart Sutra.

Later I gradually learned that Tibetans don’t understand emptiness at all.

No, the Indians at that time were like this. Their brains were very flexible. When reciting the Heart Sutra, when they saw the Heart Sutra saying, "No eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, mind, no color, sound, smell, touch, and Dharma," they would think: "No eye? That's not right. , the eyes clearly exist, but the Heart Sutra says that it does not exist, this must be an evil law.”

Immediately don't believe it.

Tibetans don’t have so many ideas. People say it’s the Buddhadharma, so they believe it.

Therefore, after Venerable Atisha learned about Tibet, he said, "Oh, ah, like Tibetans, they are very simple, their minds are very simple, and there is nothing wrong with talking about emptiness.

Indians can't do it. Talk to them about emptiness and sex. He will use his own 'intelligence' to analyze it. If he can't analyze it, he falls into stubborn emptiness. "

(12) After persuading someone from Bodhi to learn and practice Mahayana Buddhism, if they say to them: "Becoming a Buddha is very difficult, it takes a long time, and you need to practice many dharmas.

I think you do it, just practice the Theravada method and become an Arhat. "

Similar to this, this kind of talk belongs to persuading others to retreat from the heart of attaining Mahayana Bodhi, and thus breaking the Bodhisattva Precepts.

(13) Abandoning the precepts of renunciation and liberation. 

Some people who have studied Mahayana, look down on the lesser vehicles, abandon and abandon the precepts of renunciation and liberation, and they have violated this precept.

As a monk, one must cultivate the Bodhisattva vows on the basis of the monk's precepts.

243

(14) To slander the voice-hearers 

To slander the voice-hearers is to slander the Arhats and cannot get rid of the afflictions such as greed, and deny the realization of the Hinayana.

Yes, people say that an Arhat does not cut off his afflictions, that his ability and compassion are not perfect, etc., etc., saying that this Arhat is not good, that Arhat is not good, these are all slandering the voice-hearers.

(15) False talk 

The false talk here refers to the teaching of the Dharma of the Supreme Being, which refers to the self-proclaimed enlightened person in order to seek, gain fame and gain, as mentioned earlier.

(16) Taking the treasures of the Three Jewels

 refers to the powerful people who rely on power to extort the wealth and things of the Three Jewels.

Including the property of the Sangha, the monks from the four directions, the pagoda and the temple, and the personal property of the monks.

(17) The monks who have the power to control evil precepts formulate a system to distribute the property owned and deserved by monks who retreat, practice, and meditate to others, and monks break the precepts.

Lay people make use of their power to prescribe doing certain kinds of bad deeds as precepts, such as asking to do something to kill a living being, etc., which also belong to the precepts for restraining evil, but they are not precepts for restraining evil.

(18) When the bodhicitta of renunciation of vows encounters obstacles, and the bodhicitta of renunciation of vows is abandoned, it is a violation of the bodhisattva and precepts.

After attaining bodhicitta, one should always pay attention to cultivating bodhichitta, and no matter what hardships are encountered, never give up bodhicitta.

Among the eighteen fundamental precepts of the bodhisattva precepts, breaking the "persuade to quit Bodhi" or "giving up the bodhicitta vows" means breaking the bodhisattva precepts.

If you break other precepts, you only break that precept, not the Bodhisattva Precept.

To break the Bodhisattva, the eighteen fundamental precepts of the sacramental precepts, still need to satisfy the four entanglements, that is, the four conditions: voluntarily want to do that evil deed, do it without shame, do it with joy, and do not consider it as a fault.

In Buddhism, only Buddha Shakyamuni can formulate or change the precepts. Therefore, Buddha Shakyamuni is called Buddha, and no other bodhisattva or great virtue has this right.

In addition, the precepts cannot be reasoned with logic and logic, which is very important. Now many masters use logic and logic to explain the precepts, which has caused too many misunderstandings.

Those who have never received the Bodhisattva Precepts before, should consider carefully when taking and upholding these precepts. If you can keep the precepts pure, then you can take the Bodhisattva Precepts. Even if you can take and uphold one precept in a pure way, the rewards will be very great.

If you feel that you can't do it, don't take it for the time being, and you can wait until the opportunity is ripe before taking the ordination.

3. What is the nature of tolerating Paramita's humiliation? 

Forbearance includes internal causes and external conditions, and an unshakable attitude towards internal and external causes and conditions is tolerance for humiliation.

For example, when you are scolded, you can be calm, not angry, and not resentful. This kind of mentality is forbearance.

There are three types of humiliation: injury tolerance, suffering tolerance, and Dharma tolerance.

(1) Hurts and tolerance 

We must endure being hurt, beaten, scolded, and wronged by others.

Why endure it? Because these are all about eliminating karma.

At the same time, it is also retribution, which is the result of the karma created in the past or present life, and the result of the future.

There was a couple who were very affectionate when they were young, but their family did not approve of their marriage. The two said that they would commit suicide if they refused to get married. The family had no choice but to let them get married.

After two years of marriage, it was very good. After another two years, after giving birth to a child, they started to quarrel every day. My husband scolds my old mother every day.

In this way, from the age of twenty to more than fifty years old, the wife gave birth to eight children, but the husband still beat and scolded her and blamed her.

The wife wants to get a divorce, but she can't leave.

In the end, the wife had no choice, so she ran to Master Yongzeng, son, and wanted to become a monk, the Dharma King said, "Did you become a monk to avoid your family? If so, you can endure it for another two years, and your husband will, It's better for you." She came back after hearing this.

Two years later, one day, my wife was working, and suddenly my husband came to my wife and said, "Oh, my wife, I'm sorry, I've been beating and scolding you all my life, I'm sorry!" The husband wanted to change the method and play tricks on her, so she was even more afraid.

In fact, on that day, the karma between them for so many years was almost finished.

At this time, the husband realized that he should not treat his wife like this, and his love for his wife came out.

From that day on, her husband treated her very, very well.

Why is this? Queen Yong Zengfa said that in the past life of this couple, his wife was a man, and he bought a calf, and this calf was her current husband.

After two years of good raising, the calf grew up and could plow the fields, so I beat it and scold it every day and let it work.

Because two people had fate in the past life, the present life is compared, and it is easy to come together.

In his previous life, he raised cattle well for two years. In this life, when he is old, the husband has been good to his wife for two years. After that, the retribution for beating and scolding will come. In the past, more than 40 years later, the retribution debt was repaid, and the two of them could be reconciled.

Therefore, all suffering is the retribution of one's own evil deeds.

Also, when karma appears, be willing to endure it.

If the heart is not troubled, the pain will be very small.

Once you are upset, you will feel that it is a great pain.

It's like being beaten by someone, endure it for five minutes, and then it's over.

If you hold grudges in your heart, you will hold grudges for a lifetime, and you will suffer for a lifetime.

After practicing forbearance for a period of time, the heart will change quickly, and it will be easier to see the painful things.

You will find that: it was originally thought to be very serious, and the pain is actually insignificant.

For example, being scolded by someone, in essence, is just empty words, just an unpleasant tone, and there is nothing substantive.

But if you get upset and can't let it go, you always think: "Oh, he lived at that time, so he scolds me like that."

Thinking about it every day, I will really feel that there is something in my body that he has scolded, so that the more I think about it, the more painful it will be, and it will even be painful for the rest of my life.

After practicing forbearance, you will understand: Oh, this is because I scolded him in the previous life, I got the reward, it should be due, this is cause and effect;

And now that the retribution is very, well, this karma has been eliminated in this life, and I can still bear it. If I come and repay it again in this life, I may not be able to endure the suffering at that time.

Thinking this way, you will be very happy, and the pain will be very small.

(2) Suffering must be endured when encountering any difficulties, the heart must not be troubled, and it must be stable.

It is suffering.

When encountering stress, the mind should be calm, the feeling will be different, and it will be less easy to cause troubles in the future.

(3) Cultivation of Dharma-Forbearance 

In the process of cultivating the Dharma, one must endure all kinds of pain, that is, Dharma-forbearance.

For example, in lecturing the scriptures, Master's lectures are sometimes very long, large, and when the family sits and listens, the body will feel numbness and pain, and these must be endured.

If you get sick while listening to the scriptures, you must realize that you are eliminating karma.

Once when I was teaching the scriptures, I caught a cold on the day I started teaching the scriptures. I was about to speak, and when I was finished, the cold was gone. This is to eliminate karmic obstacles. No matter how painful it is, I have to endure it.

In the process of cultivating the Dharma, we must bear the pain happily and have a clear understanding of the pain.

Think this way in your heart: During the process of teaching the scriptures and teaching the Dharma, I had nightmares.

It is also very good to have a cold.

When listening to the menstruation, the pain in the lower back and the back also disappeared. There are many karmic obstacles. I just want to be happy. This is practicing Dharma forbearance.

In the Tibetan area, when the masters were studying when they were children, they were practicing Dharma forbearance at the same time.

In winter, one has to get up at four or five o'clock in the morning to recite the scriptures. The weather is so cold but even seven or eight-year-old children wear only a cassock.

After breakfast, I went to listen to the master again and lectured on the scriptures;

After listening, I have to read a book when I come back, and then rush to lunch, because I have to debate the scriptures after dinner, and I have to do evening classes after the debates.

At the very least, this kind of life will last for more than 20 years. For more than 20 years, I have to be so diligent, enterprising, and practice Dharma forbearance every day.

We studied at the Ta'er Monastery when we were young, and in order to save time, we made breakfast for several days at a time.

In the past, the conditions were very poor, there was no crispy, oil, and when making fried noodles, I just fished it in water.

In the morning, while eating and reading, I do not speak for almost the whole day, and it is even more impossible to ask the teacher if there is a problem, and then listen to the scriptures and debate the scriptures.

In this way, after living for three years, I hardly have time to communicate with other people, I just study hard.

Three years later, one of my masters said, "It's too hard for you to be like this. You can relax and talk to others, and you will understand a lot of things."

Only then did I slowly relax. During the process of cultivating and learning, I was cultivating Dharma forbearance at the same time.

Once you have cultivated the Dharma to a certain level of forbearance, you will naturally be very happy. It may seem like a lot of hard work to others, but in fact you are very happy.

4. Diligent Paramita

The desire for good karma, the yearning for good deeds, and the enterprising mind is diligence.

Jing, Jin is the heart that is aggressive towards good karma and good deeds, and the heart that yearns for things that are good or bad or evil. It is not called diligence.

For example, some people who are still in this world are very dedicated to their careers, which can only be called hard-work, not diligence.

There are three types of diligence: diligence in armor, diligence in acquiring goodness, diligence in benefiting others, and diligence in producing.

(1) When wearing armor and diligently doing good deeds, doing good deeds, or learning and cultivating the Dharma, just like a soldier wearing armor on the battlefield, he is not afraid of dangers and injuries, and he moves forward bravely to break all obstacles. Such diligence is called diligence in armor.

(2) Harmony Diligence 

Diligently practising on the six paramitas is called Harmony Diligence.

(3) Benefiting sentient beings 

making progress to benefit sentient beings is a precept, and diligence in the aspect of benefiting sentient beings means making progress for the benefit of sentient beings.

Diligence eliminates laziness and at the same time prevents evil.

When studying and diligently practicing paramita, one should start from the view of impermanence.

If you understand the principle of impermanence, and the concept of the impermanence of life  arises in your heart, you will naturally be diligent.

5. Meditation Paramita 

There are many ways to practice meditation Paramita.

The Middle Path talks about precepts, and Hui Shi has talked a lot about this, and I will add it here.

(1) Types of Meditation 

There are many kinds of meditation, which can be simply divided into three types according to the function of meditation: 

Meditation for the benefit of all living beings, Meditation for physical and mental well-being, and Meditation for cultivating merit.

(2) The sufficiency of Meditation

 to practice meditation requires a certain amount of resources. If you don’t have the resources to practice, you will not be able to get meditation for hundreds of years. It is very important to have the resources to practice meditation.

The scriptures say:

There are many ways to cultivate resources, the fundamental thing is to purify the precepts

Keep your mind and body quiet from chores, and stick to the Four Sunnahs in your life.

That is to say, the most important sustenance for meditating is: the precepts are pure, pure, away from chores, and satisfying the four holy practices.

Purity of Vows 

You may have noticed that many parts of the San Shi Dao mention that precepts must be pure, because precepts are the foundation of all merit, and it is no exception to meditation, and it is more important.
To practice meditation is to eliminate all kinds of distractions inside and outside the body and mind.

If you want to put an end to the subtle distractions of the mind, you must first get rid of the gross distractions of the body and mouth.

The precepts are pure, that is, to use the precepts to cover up the evil deeds of the body and mouth, so as to cut off the gross distractions created by the body and mouth.

Keep away from chores 

During the meditation practice, the body, speech, and mind must stay away from chores, and it is especially required that the body must stay away from chores.
Keeping the body away from chores means that the body cannot be involved in too many things, energy.

In addition, doing things like predicting fate, doing calendar calculations, and watching Feng Shui, these things are difficult to settle down, and it is even more necessary to stay away from them.

Keeping the mind away from chores means that the mind should not have distracting thoughts, but keep quiet.

Four Sunnahs 

(1) Food and drink must be adequately prepared when practicing meditation.
It is not required to have a good diet, as long as it can satisfy food and clothing, and there should be no excessive requirements for diet.

(2) Clothes should meet the needs of clothing and should be prepared adequately.

In the process of meditation, it is generally necessary to retreat for a period of time. If, due to changing seasons and other reasons, one finds that the clothes are not adequately prepared, and has to go out to prepare clothes, it will disrupt the meditation.

(3) Choose a quiet place to live in a place that satisfies you when you meditate.

In a house with no sound for four or four weeks, concentrate on meditating.

In the city, yes, but too noisy around is not suitable.

In addition, before the meditation practice is successful, try not to change it as much as possible. Changing the place of residence and moving from place to place will also become an obstacle to the practice of meditation.

(4) The body and mind like tranquility. 

The mind and body like tranquility means to get rid of greed and other evil thoughts, no greed for profit and nourishment.

Coveting the enjoyment of the five desires will not only affect the practice of meditation, but will also destroy other virtues.

Thinking of impermanence can counteract this. It is very important that the mind and body like tranquility.

Generally speaking, if you want to practice meditation, you need to find a house with a clean environment, quiet, and basic living conditions such as water, electricity, clothing and food.

In the past, Master Pabongka had many disciples. He said to his disciples, "Do you want to practice meditation? I can provide the conditions for meditation and concentration."

Then, a Mongolian lama said, "I think, practise meditation."

This lama was not even a Geshe in the three monasteries at that time, yes, just an ordinary monk.

Master Pabongka taught him the method of meditation, and provided the conditions, places, and places for meditation.

He practiced earnestly, and finally attained meditation.

After he achieved meditation, Master Pabongka taught meditation later, and he often took him by his side to demonstrate the breathing of meditation, etc. After that, everyone came to see and learn.

(3) How to practice meditation

The method of practising meditation 

The way, the method of practising meditation has already been discussed in the Taoist Taoism when he talked about precepts, concentration and wisdom, and I will simply repeat it here.

First choose a location.

We generally take the Buddha as the fixed place, which is to visualize the sitting Buddha Sakyamuni.

It is the size of a thumb or a pea or a bean, and the minimum size is not less than a grain of rice. Choose a good location, and then keep your mind fixed on it.

When breathing, the breath in the nostrils has different sizes. At the beginning, you can't distinguish it during the practice. As the mind becomes more and more calm, you can gradually feel the thickness and size of the breath.

When the mind is truly still, the qi becomes very even.

Then, as the mind stays in concentration, the breath gradually becomes smaller and smaller.

When one truly attains meditation, the breath will be gone. People are alive, but the breath will be gone.

When practicing meditation, you must focus on it, and don't do other things, not even in morning and evening classes.

After getting up in the morning, recite the Heart Sutra three times to eliminate the demons, and then make offerings to the seven branches, and then practice meditation.

With uninterrupted concentration and practice, meditation can be achieved in six months.

If you practice stagnation and stagnation, although your mind is still and relatively pure, you will not be able to achieve true meditation.

It's like rubbing wood to make a fire. Always grind it for a while and then put it down. It won't start a fire. That's the truth.

Once the meditation practice is successful, you can enter it at any time.

After entering the concentration, you can exit the concentration by making a wish.

For example, if you want to meditate for an hour, just make a wish: "I want to meditate for an hour."

You can get out of concentration after an hour, this is meditation.

Five Faults and Eight Elements in Meditation 

In the process of practising meditation, one has to experience five faults and eight lines.
The five faults refer to the five faults that will occur during the practice process, and the eight elements are the eight methods to counteract these five faults.

(1) Wu Guo said in the "Discrimination of the Middle and Borders":

257

Relying on the causes of the eight elements, eliminate the five faults.

Slackening and forgetting the professor, drowsy and lethargic,

Not doing what you do is for five faults.

1) Laziness and lethargy will not achieve meditation.

The first of the five mistakes is not to be lazy.

2) Forgetting teachers 

Forgetting the methods and objects of visualization, forgetting to meditate, methods and tips taught by masters, etc., all belong to forgetting teachers.

3) Sinking 

refers to the drowsy mind or the restless mind that occurs during meditation. These two types are obstacles to the mind.

When drowsiness arises, the mind becomes weary;

When it arises, it falls, and the mind becomes chaotic, and the mind cannot be settled in one place.

4) When the failure to do something sinks, because of understanding or other reasons, you do not take it and take the remedy. This is a fault.

5) It is also a fault to practice antidote when the behavior does not sink.

There are nine abiding minds in the practice of meditation, that is, to experience the nine levels of abiding, the experience of the mind, only then can meditation be achieved.

Before obtaining the eighth stamina, there will always be drowsiness and lethargy, and when the eighth steadfastness is obtained, the slump will cease to exist.

But at this time, if you are still observing yourself, whether you are sinking, and if you try to deal with it rashly, it will cause and hinder the mind, so it is also a kind of fault.

Of the five faults, the first two will prevent practitioners from entering meditation, concentration, and the attainment of abiding mind;

The third type will destroy the essence and quality of meditation, especially the subtle drowsiness, which many practitioners will not notice.

The latter two can affect achievement meditation.

Therefore, as practitioners we must recognize and try to remedy and remove these five faults.

(2) The Eight Elements 

 Eight Elements are the eight methods of dealing with the five faults.

1) Faith means to develop firm confidence in the practice of meditation by understanding the merits of meditation.

After getting the meditation, it will be very easy to cultivate the five supernatural powers (heavenly vision, heavenly ear, his mind, destiny, and divine feet), and it may be possible to obtain supernatural powers in five minutes.

The practice is very fast, and the wisdom is very sharp.

For example, after getting and meditating, if you visualize a flower, it is as clear and real as if you were holding it in your hand.

What is the greatest merit of meditation? After getting meditation, you can cultivate emptiness wisdom in it, and after you get emptiness wisdom, you can be liberated.

It is necessary to understand more about the merits and benefits of meditation. The more you understand, the better it will be for you to develop confidence in meditation. Once you have confidence, it will be easier to achieve meditation.

2) Desire is the interest in learning to meditate. You can also enhance your interest in learning and meditating by understanding the merits and virtues of meditating.

3) Diligence is perseverance and stamina. It is very important not to give up when encountering any obstacles, and to keep diligent.

4) After the achievement of tranquility meditation, the mind and body will be at ease.

If you achieve meditation, the body will feel very light, and the heart will also be very relaxed.

We have a lot of troubles in our hearts all the time, so we always feel that our hearts are heavy.

If the heart is heavy, no matter how light the body is, it will feel heavy.

When the mind is relaxed, the body fat will also feel very relaxed.

Master Ga Zang Qusong achieved meditation at the age of thirty-two, and when he was in his nineties, he still walked like a child, very, very light.

After sitting cross-legged and preaching for a few hours, it is enough to stand up without touching the ground with both hands, which many young lamas cannot do.

Peace of mind in body and mind is a virtue after attaining meditation.

If a person's mind is completely relaxed, it doesn't matter how heavy the body is. After a certain level of meditation, one can fly up, which is a manifestation of lightness and peace of mind and body.

Because the mind is completely relaxed, the body will be, very, very light.

Relying on the first four of the Eight Elements, Faith, Desire, Diligence, and Peace of Mind, can counteract and remove the first of the five faults, "laxity and laziness."

"Faith and Desire" change the mind from laziness caused by ignorance of meditation, to firm confidence in and love of meditation;

"Diligence" is the process of practice, and "light and tranquility" is the result of practicing meditation.

5) Mindfulness means not forgetting the power of mind of the object of visualization.

According to the teachings of Master Tsongkhapa, we take the Buddha as the object of visualization, and practice meditation with the Buddha as the object.

Visualizing the Buddha can also accumulate blessings and purify obstacles.

Mindfulness can counteract the "forgetting professor" among the five faults.

6) Right Knowing 

Right knowing is the immediate awareness of the sinking alertness, and it is the antidote to the "sinking" in the middle.

What does it mean? If you are drowsy or lost, you should be able to perceive it immediately. If you can do this, you have right knowledge.

If you fail to detect it in time, over time, you will become drowsy or lose your way, and the meditation will become chaotic.

Therefore, when practising meditation, one must have a mind of awareness, the main mind is fixed in the place of concentration, and there must also be a mind that follows the factors, which is intuitive, and observes the main mind.

Mina Rinpoche is a highly accomplished master of the Gelug School. He had a disciple of the Nyingma School. He said that if you want to go back to practice meditation, you need to close for a year.

In the summer, this disciple asked his son to go to the pagoda and visit Mina Rinpoche at the monastery. Mina Rinpoche said to his son, "Your father said he wanted to practice meditation, why would he run on the streets of Guide, come here? Going to buy something?" His son said, "No, my dad is in retreat."

Mina Rinpoche said, "Then why do I see your father running around in the street?" His son went back and asked, and he said, "Oh, Master knows everything! I've been thinking about going to the street to buy things."

This is the drop.

For this kind of heart, it is necessary to be aware of it in time to deal with it.

7) Contemplation 

Contemplation is the remedy for the fourth of the five faults, "doing nothing".

Zuosi means "thinking about doing things", thinking is thinking, thinking, and methods.

Contemplation means to perceive the occurrence through right awareness, and after sinking, you cannot let it go, but contemplate and find a way to control and counteract it.

When practising meditation, the mind should be relaxed but not too relaexed.

Too loose will make you drowsy, too tight and you will fall out of concentration, and your mind will wander.

Practice meditation with a mind that is neither loose nor tight.

The drowsy antidote:

When observing the concentration with the mind of attachment, if the concentration becomes blurred, or although it is very clear, it is not as bright as before, that is, drowsiness occurs.

At this time, the mind should be a little tighter, vigilant at all times, and the place should be very clear and bright, so that there will be no lethargic mind.

The countermeasures of the fault:

To lose is to lose the mind.

Observing with the mind of the subordinate support, is the mind of the main mind settled? Does it run away? If it runs away, bring it back, come back, and re-settle at the fixed place.

If you really can't bring it back, don't meditate, you can stand up, do prostrations, etc.

8) The meaning of equanimity is to say that when practicing meditation, for the first of the five faults, the five faults should be "controlled", and when there is no sinking, equanimity should be cultivated.

If you are reluctant to give up, but try to deal with it rashly, this is also a fault.

When you attain the eighth abiding mind through meditation, there will be no more sinking. If you continue to observe the sinking in vain, and think about dealing with it, you will be right.

Therefore, at this time, it is no longer necessary to observe the mind, but to use "exercise equanimity" to make the mind gentle and upright, and keep the mind running freely.

(4) Six Powers of Meditation 

When practising meditation, in addition to paying attention to the five faults, and using the eight elements to treat them, you must also experience the mind of abiding, that is, the mind of nine abiding. In fact, Liuli has already talked about it before, so I will introduce it here.

Hearing power is listening to the teacher's teaching.

If you don’t have the power to think and listen, you won’t know how to practice meditation. After hearing it, you need to be right. Only by diligently thinking about the method, faults, and merits of meditation can you transform it into your own understanding.

Therefore, listening and thinking are very important, and the power of thinking can also enable us to recognize coarse discriminative thoughts during meditation.

The power of mindfulness is the power of contemplation of meditation.
When contemplating Buddha Shakyamuni, you must not forget to eat or sleep, you must never forget to visualize, and you must not forget to do anything. Remember to visualize the fixed place.

When resting or sleeping, set your mind on the Buddha first, and then go to sleep.

If you can't fall asleep in this way, visualize Sakyamuni Buddha sitting on the pillow, with your head in the Buddha's arms, or on the lap, and then go back to sleep.

Right comprehension is the alert mind that immediately perceives drowsiness, the ability to perceive the drowsy, especially the subtle drowsiness.

After the energy sinks and does not reappear, in order to get away from the sinking as soon as possible, one should raise the energy and practice diligently, so that the sinking can be completely eradicated.

After the force of habit has been completely eliminated and removed, the mind that persists in the continuous practice of meditation should arise, until the meditation is achieved.

These are very important for meditation practice.

(5) Meditation practitioners who practice meditation, so that their minds are not scattered and stay in one state, will experience nine levels of abiding minds during the process, that is, nine abiding minds.

Jiuzhu heart map

![Map of the 7 minds](/images/map7minds.png)

Map of the 7 minds.

Resting the mind can rest the mind in the place of concentration, that is, resting the mind.
This stage mainly relies on the "hearing power" of the six powers, and the mind rests in the object, which is the concentration.

At this stage, the mind can only be settled in a fixed place for a short time, it cannot last for a long time, so it cannot last.

At this time, you will find that there are more thoughts in your mind than when you don’t practice meditation. In fact, it’s not that there are more thoughts, but because you haven’t practiced meditation, your mind hasn’t calmed down, and you don’t know that your mind will produce so many different thoughts.

Capturing the Mind 

When the mind reacts to an external object, it can bring the mind back, which is the Capturing the Mind.
This stage mainly relies on the "thinking power" of the six powers.

Cultivation, after meditating for a period of time, the mind will stay in the place of concentration for a little longer, and it will not be so scattered.

At this time, you can experience that there are not so many thoughts in your heart, and the discriminating thoughts seem to be there sometimes and sometimes not.

In the stage of calming the mind and holding the mind, the time for the mind to be scattered should be longer than the time for resting, the time for sinking is more, and the time for resting is less.

When the mind is understood (understood separately) when it acts on external objects, it can make the mind quickly return to the place of concentration, which is the liberation of the mind.
At this stage, the mind continues to rest in the samādhi.

Be careful, when the mind is occasionally scattered, and when it leaves the concentration, it can be immediately noticed, and then the thoughts of separation and understanding can be settled on the concentration again.

Compared with the previous two stages, the time of distraction is already very short, and part of mindfulness can arise.

To turn the mind is to stop the mind of knowing and to be happy to be at rest.
At this stage, since a relatively strong "mindfulness and power" has been generated, one can see that the thoughts of discrimination do not depart from the concentration, so from now on, the concentration will not be lost.

But there has already been a comparison, stronger drowsiness and sluggishness.

The third and fourth abiding minds mainly rely on the "mindfulness, power" of the six powers.

From then on, mindfulness matures.

The time of subduing the mind in meditation is too long. When the mind feels tired, it can subdue the tired mentality, which is to subdue the mind.
At this stage, there is no gross lethargy and lethargy.

But because the control of the mind is too tight, it is possible to be drowsy.

Therefore, we must generate the "right knowledge" in the six powers to observe, and at the same time, think about the merits of practicing meditation as mentioned in the "faith" in the eight elements, so that the mind will be more active and no longer drowsy.

When there is a moving thought in the mind, you can make the thought stop immediately, that is, rest, stop the mind.
In the fifth stage, in order to avoid subtle lethargy, the mind must be activated. However, if the mind is too active, there is a danger of life and subtleties falling off.

At this time, it is necessary to develop the "right knowledge" capable of knowing the subtle disturbances, and to perceive and eliminate the subtle disturbances in time.

At this stage, there is no need to worry about being drowsy.

The fifth and sixth abiding minds mainly rely on the "power of comprehension".

If the abiding mind at this stage is complete, the power of right comprehension will also be complete.

When the mind is extinguished, when it arises and sinks, it can be extinguished immediately, that is, the mind is extinguished.
In the seventh stage, since the first six sedative minds have already been fully completed, there is basically no drowsiness and sluggishness at this time, but one must still be alert to sinking and slumping, and generate the "energy force" of the six powers, and thoroughly , break off the sink.

When the delusions stop, you can realize that the nature of the mind is original and pure, and then keep the natural tranquility.
At this stage, as long as you pay a little attention at the beginning of meditation, you will be able to avoid sinking during the whole process.

At this time, lethargy and sluggishness are like defeated enemies. From the beginning, they are strong and powerful, then gradually weaken, and finally disappear completely.

Therefore, starting from No. 8, the mind of eight dwellings, it is no longer necessary to bring up the power of right comprehension.

The seventh and eighth abiding minds mainly rely on the "power of energy".

After holding the mind to achieve meditation, you must practice it regularly, and you will naturally be able to live in meditation, and you will naturally be able to do good and stop evil.
Due to the continuous practice of the eighth stage, this stage is already acceptable, so it can be achieved naturally without special effort.

Therefore, at this time, it is possible to enter samadhi without the slightest effort.

The ninth abiding mind mainly relies on the "training force" of the six forces.

In the time of the Middle Path, he talked about the practice method of meditation;

The Dharma Master talks about the conditions that need to be met to achieve meditation, as well as the understanding and handling of the changes in the mind during the practice process.

The combination of the two parts is the perfect method of meditation practice.

6. Wisdom Paramita

The essence of wisdom is the ability to discern the object of observation and the ability to distinguish between good and evil.

It is the ability to distinguish between black and white, good and evil, and so on.

It can be divided into: ultimate truth wisdom, mundane truth wisdom, wisdom, and benefiting sentient beings wisdom.

(1) Types of Wisdom

Ultimate Truth Wisdom 

Ultimate Truth Wisdom speaks of emptiness, that is, the emptiness of dependent origination, yes, the essence and nature of all things.

Nagarjuna
![Nagarjuna](/images/nagarjuna.png)




![Asanga](/images/unsungbodhi.png)

无著菩萨 Asanga

Regarding the emptiness of dependent origination, various schools have different views. The Gelug School, which holds the middle view, is based on the six theories of Nagarjuna Bodhisattva.

Shakyamuni Buddha turned the wheel of Dharma three times, and Nagarjuna's six discourses came from the second turning of the wheel of no form, the Dharma wheel.

Nagarjuna Bodhisattva is also known as Longmeng. In the history of Buddhism, he is recognized as a landed Bodhisattva. The Buddha once prophesied Nagarjuna Bodhisattva in the Langkavatara Sutra:

The stele in the south reaches the country, with auspicious bhikkhus,

His name is called the dragon, which can break through the boundless.

It means that at that time, in the southern country of Beida in India, there will be an auspicious monk named Longmeng in the future. After the Buddha's nirvana, when there is a dispute within Buddhism, he will stand up and promote the Mahayana, the right view, and the elimination of Boundless and boundless, interpreting the prajnaparamita method.

In many other classics, such as the "Drum Sutra", "The Great Cloud Sutra", "Manjushri Root Tantra" and other Mahayana classics and tantras, there are also clear prophecies for Longmeng Bodhisattva and Sagittarius. Some say that he is a bodhisattvas in one place, some say he is a bodhisattva in seven places, and some say he has become a Buddha.

In Tibetan Buddhism, Nagarjuna is known as one of the "two Victors and six solemnities";

In Chinese Buddhism and religion, Nagarjuna Bodhisattva is regarded as the founder of the mountain by the eight schools, that is, the common ancestor of the eight schools.

Such great bodhisattvas and sages, none of the Buddhists do not recognize, and it is even more correct to follow the teachings of Nagarjuna Bodhisattva to study and cultivate.

Nagarjuna Bodhisattva had five major disciples. Due to their different roots, different understandings, and different understandings, they have different views on Madhyamika, which gradually formed. Different schools of thought are more famous. And the Middle Way should be a faction.

The most complete, full, and ultimate understanding of the Buddha's Dependent Origination is the Middle Way of Yingcheng School, and the Gelug School is the holding and response, the middle view of the school.

At that time, there were four major schools in Indian Buddhism, and there were also four major schools in Tibetan Buddhism. These schools were all the same in terms of convenient methods. The difference was that they had higher and lower right views.

The difference in right view does not mean that there is a wrong view, but it refers to whether the understanding of the Buddha and of Dependent Origination of the Empty Right View is ultimate and complete.

For example, if you realize the right view of the Mind-Only School, you can get rid of many afflictions, but not all afflictions.

In the same way, the realization of Madhyamika, the right view of the continuum, can only remove most of the afflictions.

Therefore, the right views of the Mind-Only School and the Madhyamika Self-Continuing School are not ultimate, but no, they can be said to be wrong or right views.

However, if you realize the right view of the Middle Way, you can get rid of all afflictions.

Therefore, the right view of the middle school should be the most ultimate and perfect.

Among the four major schools of Tibetan Buddhism, the Gelug School is the Madhyamika School that should be formed, and uses the Madhyamika view to explain emptiness;

The Nyingma school talks about great circle, fullness, and emptiness;

The right view of the Kagyu School is Mahamudra, which is also about emptiness.

Although they all talk about emptiness, the way of talking about it and the perspectives are different. Emptiness from the perspective of people without self and from the perspective of law without self is different, the same.

In Master Tsongkhapa's writings, there are two thick explanations of Nagarjuna's Six Treatises and "Into the Middle". From any point of view, the explanation of emptiness is very complete and comprehensive.

There were many schools in the Tibetan area before. The big ones were Nyingma, Kagyu, Kadam, Sakya, etc., and the small ones were Jeluo, Shishen, etc. Eighteen small schools appeared.

Master Tsongkhapa founded the Gelug School. After the Gelug School was established, no new schools arose. Why? Because Master Tsongkhapa integrated the purest traditions, the most essential methods of other schools into the Gelug School.

----

For example, in the Gelug School, Mahamudra and Dhysika Vajra are from the Kagyu School, the Five Great Treatises, Debating Sutras, San Shi Dao and other methods come from the Kadampa School, and the Victory Vajra, the Thirteen Golden Methods, etc. come from the Sakya School. , Matou Mingwang and others are from Nyingma School, Mahavira is the inheritance of Jeluoyu Master, Dorada Vajra Vajra transmission is inherited from Master Luo Zhe, the body-giving method is from Maji Lazhun, and the breath-judgment method is from Papa Master Dangba.

----

The best methods of all schools are integrated into the Gelug School.

Therefore, in the wisdom of the ultimate truth, that is, the Right View of the emptiness of dependent origination, it can be said that the Right View of the Gelug school has been fully integrated with the right views of other schools, the wisdom of the ultimate truth of the Gelug school, Wisdom and Right View are the most sublime, the most ultimate and the most complete.

Worldly Truth Wisdom 

Worldly Truth Wisdom speaks about the Five Great Laws and Ten Great Laws, wisdom.

For example, medicine, technology, science, philosophy, etc., these are the wisdom of mundane truth.

If you want to become a Buddha, you must learn all the knowledge. The more you learn, the more beneficial it will be to save sentient beings.

Wisdom of benefiting sentient beings 

Wisdom of benefiting sentient beings is to teach sentient beings in this life and the next life, the methods of accumulating blessings, doing good and breaking evil, eliminating karmic obstacles, etc., as well as the wisdom of serving and doing things for all sentient beings.
Generally speaking, the wisdom paramita includes these three kinds of wisdom.

Wisdom is very, very important, you need wisdom to do anything, and you can succeed if you have wisdom.

Not having wisdom is not only difficult to succeed, but also difficult to make sentient beings happy in the way of doing things.

The Hundred Treatises on Wisdom says:

Visible and invisible merit, 

the source is wisdom

In order to cultivate the two merits, 

mastering wisdom is essential.

The root of success or failure is wisdom. What kind of merit and virtue you want to achieve, whether you can achieve it or not, depends on wisdom.

(2) Briefly analyze the Bodhgāra no-self. 

We will talk about the three ways, and learn and cultivate the steps of the Bodhi path. The purpose is to obtain liberation.

To be liberated, we must break the two attachments to self and the Dharma;

However, to get rid of the two attachments, one needs the wisdom of emptiness.

Clinging to the existence of "I" is egoism;

Persistence in all things, all laws exist, is law enforcement;

Because I am also the one, part of all things and all laws, so breaking the ego will also break part of the law, and after breaking the ego, it will be easier to break the law.

Therefore, to break the second and middle attachment, the main thing is to break the ego-clinging. Here, I will briefly talk about how to break the non-self of Pudgala, that is, the method of breaking the ego-clinging.

The way to recognize the wisdom of emptiness starts with understanding what "I" is.
What outsiders think of me is the "Chang Yi autonomous" me.

"Changing" means eternity, "one" means unchanging, and autonomy means being able to dominate and control oneself without relying on dependent origination.

It is the belief that there is a self-existing self that is ever-changing, able to be one, and to be maintained by itself.

We Buddhists believe that all things and all dharmas are caused by conditions, and there is no such thing as a cause.

There are various schools of Buddhism and the schools of scriptures deny it. They have determined that there is a constant and autonomous self, and believe that there is no eternal and unchanging self, because all things and all dharmas are dependent on origin. Since it is dependent on origin, it is impermanent, so "I" is also impermanent.

To break the ego, we must first understand what the ego is. To put it simply, the ego is the imagined self, the false self.

At the same time, I am the one who causes troubles. With this false appearance, I will have all troubles. If I get rid of this false appearance, I will be broken. The root of troubles will naturally cut off troubles.

What we think now, for me, is all ego-attached me.

The ego is divided into two types: the ego that arises from the discriminating ego, and the ego that arises from the innate ego.

The ego generated by the separation of ego is the ego imagined in this life, especially the ego that sectarians think.

The innate ego-clinging self is the imaginary self that has been brought over from generation to generation, and it is there from birth.

All sentient beings like ants and mosquitoes have an innate ego and clinging, but there is no distinguishing ego clinging.

First of all, it is very important to identify this ego-attached ego. To identify this ego-attached ego, we must first find it.

One, under normal circumstances, this imaginary me is difficult to find. In some special circumstances, such as when I am angry, or when I am very happy, if I am insulted by someone, I may find this imaginary me.

For example, when we are beaten, we will be very angry and question others: "Why did you beat me?" This is who we imagine me to be.

Another example, someone accuses us and says: "Hey, you stole my things". 
If we haven't stolen anything, we would immediately hit back: "Hey, why do you say that?,I didn't steal your stuff, I didn't steal anything." 

At this time, you will feel as if there is a qi in your body, rushing straight from the lower part of the body to the top of the head, this is the me we imagined, this me actually does not exist.

At this time, if a master happened to say, "Hey, where is this I who has been wronged?" We can understand it all at once.

The I rushing out like qi is what we imagined in our consciousness.

There was a master of the Kagyu School whose father was killed before he became a monk. After he became a monk, he worshipped the very high-achieving Pamu Drupa, the master.

After apprenticeship, although he has been cultivating, he still can't let go of his hatred for the enemy who killed his father.

He was also very distressed, so he went to ask the master, and the master said, I have a solution.

A few days later, the Master invited the man who killed the disciple's father to have tea together at home.

Then, the master sent someone to call his disciple. As soon as he came over and saw the enemy who killed his father, he immediately rushed over and wanted to beat him.

At this time, the master said: 

"Look, your I is so powerful! You have to see where your I is now!" After reminding him, he understood it all at once, and immediately caught it, holding on to what he imagined. The me, then enters emptiness.

So, once you catch the imaginary I, you will find that this I cannot be settled.

When we use the wisdom of emptiness to break the ego, we need to use nine logics.

The nine logics are: 

Negation of the Four Realms, 

Reasonable Reason, 

Reason, 

Reason, 

Negation of the Four Reasons, 

One Different Reasoning, 

Diamond Scrap Cause, 

Five Reasons, 

Reasoning, 

Seven Reasonable Reasoning, 

Four Essential Reasoning, 

and Negative Reasoning.

These nine logics are described in Madhyamika theory. If you can thoroughly understand these nine logics, it will be easier to understand emptiness. This time, I will use the four-element reasoning method to talk about emptiness.

The four main points of reasoning are: 
identify the object to be denied, 
identify, determine the coverage of the concept,
identify non-oneness, 

and identify non-differential.

(1) To identify the object of negation, we must first understand that the object of negation we want to identify is the ego.

To break the ego, we must know the I who wants to break.

If you don't know it, you can't break it, just like catching a thief, you must first recognize and identify the thief, otherwise you won't be able to catch him even if you meet him face-to-face.

First come to know the egoistic self.

Ask yourself: Who am I?

When we ask ourselves this question, we usually say our own name, but the answer is not valid.

Because the name can be changed, if your name is Cicheng, and someone asks: "Who are you?", you will say: "I am Cicheng."

However, Cicheng is just a name, a character. If the name is changed to Dorje, the next achievement becomes Dorje.

But, yes, although the name has changed, the person has not changed, so the real I cannot be identified with the name.

Try asking yourself again: Where am I?

Think about it carefully, look for where I am in our own body or in our residence.

In the past, the Bodhisattva of the World Family was studying in a certain school. At that time, the master of a certain school said "I have", that is, people have me, Dharma, and I.

Because the masters often talk about the existence of I and the Dharma that has me, the Bodhisattva in the world asked, "You said 'I have', but I can't find my I, ah, where am I? Master, give me some pointers."

When the master heard it, he was a little unhappy, and said, "Go find it yourself. I can't tell you, and I can't tell you where you are."

In the evening, the Bodhisattva, the relative of the world, got an oil lamp and looked for I everywhere. When the master saw it, he said angrily:

283

"You're making fun of me, I didn't tell you to look for your I like this, your I is in the house."

Shiqin Bodhisattva said: "I can't find it in the house, where am I.

The master said, "Look again from head to toe.

Shiqin Bodhisattva said: "From the top of the head to the soles of the feet, it is the whole body, and this body is not me.

If I die, I should not be there, but my body is still there;

And it was my body that was cremated after my death, not me.

Because if it is I who is cremated, I should really be extinguished;

If I destroy me, I should not be reborn.

None of these aspects make sense, so this, head-to-toe body is not me.

After listening to the master, he said: "You are not a disciple with a foundation of the School, you should go to the School of the classics."

The Bodhisattva from the world came to the school of scriptures and asked the master of the school of scriptures, "Who am I?" The master of the school of scriptures said, "The five aggregates are I." The five aggregates are form, feeling, thought, action, and consciousness.

The Bodhisattva of Shiqin said: "If the five aggregates are I, and there are five aggregates, then I have become five, not one? If it is said that I am one, and I and the five aggregates are indistinguishable, then, either I have become five, or I have become one, and the five aggregates have also become one, both of which cannot be established."

The master heard it and said, "I can't tame you, I'll introduce you to a master, go and learn from him."

So, the bodhisattva of the worldly relatives went to another master of the School of scriptures.

He asked again, "Who am I? Where am I?" The master said, "Consciousness is I."

Shiqin Bodhisattva thought, "Oh, that's right, it is this consciousness that is reborn from generation to generation.

So, the awareness is that I should be right. "

In this way, the Bodhisattva of the World Family recognized that consciousness is I, and what I have established is consciousness.

He wrote a book based on this insight.

After seeing it, the Madhyamika school critics rejected his book, and also rejected the views of worldly relatives of Bodhisattvas.

The Madhyamika commentator said: "If the consciousness is I, then which one is the consciousness of the past life, the present life, and the future life? If the three consciousnesses are all, I have become three?" In this regard, the Bodhisattva World did not respond.

In the Madhyamika Self-Continuation, although the masters of the School have denied the Bodhisattva of the world, they are still at ease and cannot stand up to this self.

Consciousness-only schools also deny that consciousness is I. They say, "Alaya, consciousness is I."

The Mind-only school believes that consciousness includes many kinds, among them, there is the consciousness of defilement, and there is alaya consciousness.

The defiled consciousness is not I, it is the afflictions that defile I, and the alaya consciousness is I.

After seeing it, the masters of the Madhyamika school said: "The nature of good and evil karma is not bad, and it does not need to be hidden in the alaya consciousness."

They are not bad in nature and have talked a lot.

The masters of the Yingcheng School of Madhyamika said: "O Layye Shi is not me who is established by the Mind-only school, nor is the consciousness established by the Sutra School and the Madhyamika Self-Continuing School, nor is it me who is established by some schools. .

I, should be, Pudgala, established in the five aggregates, and existing in the famous words;

I leave, the five aggregates cannot be opened, and the five aggregates cannot be separated from me;

But I am not the five aggregates either, I only exist in famous sayings. "

The I we imagine now is not the real I.

There are many kinds of I imagining. The imaginary I of some schools is the whole body from head to toe. Many unethical masters imagine I like this;

Some masters imagine that I am the whole of the five aggregates;

Others think consciousness is I;

Some people think that Alai, Yeshi is me.

These are all the me imagined by masters of different schools and people of different levels, but they are not the real I.

These denied I's can be divided into two categories: one is the fake I, the fake I imagined;

The other type is the self that exists and is imagined in the consciousness of life after life.

What we have just said is that the first type of imaginary I is not the second type.

The second type of birth, the self imagined from life to life, is the belief that body and mind are indistinguishable. This self cannot be without a body or a mind.

Just like milk tea, there is a difference between milk and water, but water with milk in it, can’t be distinguished once it’s mixed up. The me in this state of indistinguishable body and mind is the I born from the innate ego.

Except for Pudgala, which is established in the five aggregates, exists in the name, and exists in words, as mentioned by the Madhyamika Yingcheng School, all other egos are whether we want to be or not, especially the ego generated by the innate ego. We have to, no.

(2) It is believed that the coverage of the concept cannot be broken by the real self, and the false self is the same as the body and mind, and there is no other self, which is what we want to break.

After I have determined that this is going to be broken, what method should I use to break it? We use conceptual coverage to break down the false self.

The coverage of the concept is as follows: if the false self exists, then this self must be either "one" or "different".

That is to say, either is "one" with the five aggregates, and is a subject;

Or, the five aggregates are "different", and the five aggregates exist in a form that is not a subject.

If it is neither "one" nor "different", then the false self should not exist.

This is certain, and it is acceptable to everyone.

After this is determined, if the false self exists, then we will find out whether the false self is "one" or "different".

287

(3) Determining non-oneness 

If I and the five aggregates are "one", the five aggregates and I should be the same.

If this is the case, the five aggregates are divided into five types: form, feeling, perception, formation, and consciousness. I should also become five, but this is impossible.

If you think that I have only one, one, then the five aggregates will also become one, but the five aggregates are five, not one, and it is equally invalid.

The two aspects cannot be explained, so the self and the five aggregates, who think that the false appearance is "one", cannot be settled.

(4) Determining non-differentiation 

If the false self and the five aggregates are "different", that is, if the self and the five aggregates are aliens, this is divided into two cases.

If the false self exists depending on the five aggregates.

Then, five, there are five aggregates. If the false self and the five aggregates are different, there should also be five I's. That is to say, there should be one self on each of the five aggregates.

We all know this doesn't make sense.

If the false self exists apart from the five aggregates.

Then, after losing the five aggregates, if I try to find another self, I can't find it. The Bodhisattva of the world lit an oil lamp and looked everywhere, but he couldn't find it.

Therefore, the I and the five aggregates, who have identified false appearances, are "different" and cannot be settled.

To observe the nature of things, we briefly summarize the above four types:
First of all, we must really understand what the false self is, and then think about whether the false self exists.

Then, from the perspective of existence, it is reasonable to say that if there is a false self, the false self and the five aggregates should be either "one" or "different". Observe from these two aspects according to the right principles, if neither can be found. , then, it can be concluded that the false self does not exist.

Once it is determined that the false self does not exist, the false self we imagined in the past will be empty, and the mind will naturally enter the emptiness. The meaning of emptiness does not exist.

Because all things and ten thousand things are the realization of the mind, ten thousand things are all things of false appearance, all things of false appearance are empty, everything in the mind will be empty, and it will enter into emptiness.

Stay in the air for as long as you can, and when you come out, you will understand: Oh, this is the real me! All things, the real face turned out to be like this!

This situation is more difficult to understand. For example, for example, someone we always thought was our closest friend, turns out to be our most sinister opponent.

At this time, everything about him in our hearts collapsed suddenly, the image of our close friend was in our hearts, and our hearts were empty, and we saw his true face.

That person has always existed in the image of a friend, but we have not seen his true colors before.

In the same way, all things and all dharmas have always existed, but we do not understand their true colors.

All things that we have come to know are all false things.

When one realizes emptiness, the original understanding of all dharmas and all things in the mind becomes empty, and then one sees the true face of all things, all things and all dharmas.

The importance of accumulating merits 

We are still ordinary people, and we have not yet realized the true face of all things and myriad dharmas.
Now, it is time to accumulate more blessings and reduce ego attachment;

Listen to the scriptures, variety, seeds, and pay attention to the seeds of emptiness.

If you have the seeds of emptiness, when you have sufficient karma, good fortune, and sufficient resources, and listen to Master teach the Dharma, it may only take a sentence or two to realize emptiness and break the false self.

When the state and function of emptiness destroy the false self, there are two situations:

Those who have learned the wisdom of emptiness in previous lives will be very happy if the false self is broken;

Those who have not learned the wisdom of emptiness, and those who have broken through the false appearance, will temporarily have a little bit of fear when they realize that there is no self in human beings.

This kind of fear lasts for about half a day at the longest. If it is half a day, if it takes time, in this half day, much of the karma in this person's life will disappear at once.

Some people say that this kind of fear drives people crazy but wait, wait, no, the fear is only for a little while, and, soon enough, emptiness is understood and happily accepted.

This is the emptiness of the Madhyamika school, the Madhyamika school's understanding of everything, as it really is.

If you find the emptiness of the Madhyamika school difficult to understand, we can understand the emptiness of the Mind-only school. For the Mind-only school, what is emptiness? Mind-only schools believe that all things and all laws are consciousness, the realization of which is the change of the mind, and nothing exists in the external environment.

For example, we often say that a glass of water is just water when we look at it, and nectar
 when we really see it, while beings in the realm of hungry ghosts see a glass of pus and blood.

Different sentient beings see things differently.

The Mind-Only School believes that this is because of the changes in the minds of all living beings. All things exist in the mind, but do not exist in the external environment.

Therefore, we should not be attached to the quality of the external environment, such as seeing a person. His relatives and friends see him as a good person, and enemies see him as a bad person. These views are realized by the greed of relatives and friends and the hatred of enemies.

291

In fact, this person is not as good as relatives and friends see him, nor is he as bad as seen by enemies. Good and bad are caused by the troubles in people's hearts. Yes, good and evil all come from the changes in people's minds. They do not exist externally.

This realization can be seen as a basis for emptiness.

We Madhya Pradesh deny these.

The Madhyamika school believes that the external world exists, and due to the action of karma or mental force, the external world will change, but the change does not mean that the external world does not exist.

The emptiness that Mind-Only schools talk about is not true emptiness.

However, by accepting this understanding of emptiness, one can dilute one's own attachments, and dilute ego and law-enforcement.

For people with blunt roots, this is also a way to recognize emptiness - sexuality.

But for the people of Ruigen, if they say that everything is in the outer world and does not exist, the people of Ruigen will say, it is impossible, this house is clearly here, and they say that it does not exist in the outer world, how can it be? Can it? How can it make sense to say that humans do not exist outside the world? , the same glass of water, the gods see it as nectar, it is because of the blessings of the gods, and the hungry ghost sees it as pus and blood, because of the karma of the hungry ghost.

However, it does not mean that nothing exists in the external world, and the Madhyamika school rejects it, and the mind-only school talks about emptiness.

However, since we can't understand it yet, to understand the emptiness of Madhyamika school, we should temporarily understand it according to the knowledge-only understanding. Yes, it is also helpful to understand the essence of all things and all dharmas.

After realizing that there is no self in human beings, all afflictions can be eliminated.

The source of our troubles is all because of "I": I am angry, - he is not good to me, he is not good to me;

Greedy I – I need money, I need many things;

Proud I – I have culture, I have wealth, etc.;

Jealous I – he looks better than me, I can't take it! , . . . 

These are all false appearances of I, which cause us to arouse greed, hatred, delusion, laziness, doubt, and wrong views are the root causes of all afflictions.

When the falsehood is broken, the self of the form will naturally break the ego-clinging, and also break all the troubles caused by the ego-clinging. This is the uniqueness of the wisdom of emptiness.

The sixth paramita in the six paramitas is the wave of wisdom, Ramita, and when cultivating the stages of the Bodhi path, these are all things that need to be cultivated.

We, we must be diligent and work hard, not only to cultivate six paramitas, but preferably to be able to cultivate ten paramitas.

7. Convenient Paramita

When saving sentient beings, teach them the appropriate Dharma door, that is, Fang, Paramita.

The Dharma door that is suitable for all sentient beings is the order of the Three Paths and the Path of Bodhi. When cultivating, you should practice step by step.

If some people have already obtained renunciation in a previous life or in this life, there is no need to teach them about the Lower Path. They can start from the Middle Shido, or start from the Upper Path. For them, this is the convenient method.

If some people have attained Bodhicitta, then there is no need to teach the Three Path, and they can study the second stage of Tantra.

The convenient method is to choose to open different methods for enlightenment according to the different foundations of sentient beings.

For ordinary people like us, San Shi Dao is the most suitable method, which is the convenient method.

There is also a convenient method. Some people have practiced Guanyin Bodhisattva's method in the past life. If they can be taught to continue to practice this method in this life, they will easily obtain the blessing of Guanyin Bodhisattva, and the achievement will be faster.

There are also some people who have practiced the teachings of Amitabha Buddha, Manjushri Bodhisattva, etc. in their previous lives. 

Masters with supernatural powers can see which deity, boddhisatva, and Buddha a disciple has cultivated in the past life, and teach them to continue to practice this deity in this life. It will be easier to learn and cultivate. It is also a convenient method.

8. May Paramita Buddha say that the power of the vow is inconceivable.

We have to make a lot of vows, and we have to keep a lot of vows.

For example, if you don’t understand a certain scripture, you can put the scripture on your head and make a vow: “May I understand the Dharma and meaning of this scripture, so that I can fully understand the Dharma taught in it.” And so on.

You can also sutra in peacetime, often making vows, such as vowing that the merits of your body, speech, and mind can benefit all beings, and that all beings in the six realms will be free from suffering and be happy: 

"May whatever I do be able to benefit all beings;

Words can benefit all beings;

What you think in your heart can benefit all beings.

"May everything I do be beneficial to all beings. "

If you often make a vow to benefit sentient beings, or make your vows with great intentions, it will be very easy to save sentient beings in future generations.

The Master Bodova Sutra often tells the parables of birds and animals. When he speaks, he directly points to the hearts of the people. After listening to it, everyone immediately understands a lot of truth.

Why? Yes, because of Master Bodova's will.

Without great motivation, even if everything is correct, it will be difficult for sentient beings to get into their hearts after hearing them, so it cannot make people change their xinxing.

Therefore, we should always make good vows and great vows. This is the vow Paramita.

9. Paramita of Power

The Paramita of Power is the ability to cultivate and save sentient beings.

We can often make a wish:

"May I be as wise as Manjushri Bodhisattva in this life and in the next life;

Compassionate and perfect like Guanyin Bodhisattva;

Like Vajrapani Bodhisattva, full of power;

Like Medicine Buddha, the ability to cure diseases is perfect. "

Make such a wish often, and this kind of willing power can make our ability increase and expand.

In addition, when making offerings, there are many different types of offerings that need to be offered.

For example, if you want to obtain the ten powers of Vajrapani Bodhisattva, you must make offerings to the seven treasures, eight offerings, auspicious eight treasures, five offerings, etc., and making offerings with these kinds of thoughts and offerings is also the achievement of power paramita.

10. The Paramita of Great Wisdom is cultivated by Bodhisattvas above the ground.

There are two kinds of wisdom: the wisdom of receiving Dharma and music, and the wisdom of mature feeling.

Among them, the wisdom of receiving Dharma and music refers to the wisdom that fully understands the characteristics and commonalities of all things;

Mature sentient wisdom refers to the wisdom that can observe the qualities of all sentient beings and can prescribe the right medicine.

We now have a brief understanding of these contents, and with the improvement of our studies, the improvement of our realm, we will experience more.

**So far, the ten paramitas are simply finished.**

In the third section, after you have done ten paramitas, you will need to practice four sets.

The four sets are: 


generosity, 

good words, 

good deeds, 

good colleagues.

The purpose of the four sets is to guide sentient beings into Buddhism. First, all sentient beings agree to the Buddha's principles, accept the Buddha's teachings, and then jointly learn the four methods of Buddha's liberation.

After reaching the level of being able to teach the scriptures and save sentient beings, when you truly become a guru, you need to master the principles and methods of receiving, guiding, and saving people. It can also be said to be the criteria for dealing with people and things in Buddhism.

1. Giving 

Since ordinary people are easily seduced by wealth, they should first give wealth to make all living beings happy, and accept them as they would family members.

Gradually introduce it, the right way to enter the Buddhist Dharma is to give and take, and it is also suitable for disciples who are willing to learn.

As a master, when the conditions for the disciples to study the Dharma are not enough, so that they hinder their study, the master should give the disciples the conditions for studying the Dharma.

For example, if the disciple does not have a place to live, if the master has the conditions, he will provide the disciple with a place to live;

If the disciple lacks food, the master will provide the disciple with food.

The purpose is to enable disciples to study the Dharma with peace of mind.

297

The meaning of giving of the four elements and the giving of the six paramitas are completely different.

The giving of the six paramitas can be said to be for the sake of saving oneself, such as giving money to oneself, whether it is to eliminate one's own greed, mindfulness, or to accumulate blessings, all of which are accumulated for oneself to become a Buddha.

The purpose of giving in four sets is to gain the trust of others, so as to guide others to learn Buddhism and enter Buddhism.

2. Good Words 

Good Words, also known as Kind Words, on the one hand, is to follow the foundation of sentient beings, to teach some worldly truths that sentient beings are willing to accept, so that they are happy, content, willing to enter Buddhism, and then accept them as disciples, gradually begin to study the way of Buddha.

On the other hand, the most important thing is to save all sentient beings by teaching the scriptures according to the foundation and love of all sentient beings.

Beautiful words are not praised and praised every day, this is not a beautiful word photo.

3. Good Conduct 

Beneficial conduct refers to those who practice the Bodhisattva Way, with their behavior of benefiting others, to influence all beings to practice the Buddha Way together, so as to achieve the goal of saving all sentient beings.

There are two types of benefits:

(1) The immature can make the immature mature, which refers to those who have not entered the Way.

The corresponding Dharma door should be taught to immature people, so that their foundation matures and grows.

For example, in order to live in this world, you can teach the methods of health, longevity, and wealth;

For the liberation of future generations, for those who have the opportunity, you can persuade them to become monks, so as to benefit more sentient beings and practice diligently.

(2) The mature person can liberate 

the mature person refers to the person who has entered the path.

From the moment when the concept of impermanence in life is understood, one is considered to have entered the Dao.

Yes, those who have matured can teach the Three Ways, the Four Tantras of Tantric Buddhism, etc., to guide and lead them to liberation and become Buddhas. These are all beneficial actions.

4. Colleagues who practice Mahayana Buddhism should go deep into society, contact and interact with people from all walks of life, make friends and colleagues with sentient beings, and save them when opportunities and predestined relationships are ripe;

At the same time, I have to be like others, practice, follow the teachings, and practice diligently. These are the actions of a colleague.

At the same time, you must also pay attention to keeping your words and deeds consistent. What you teach others, and yourself, must also be learned and cultivated well.

For example, the master asks the disciple to learn and practice the three ways, but if the master himself does not practice, the disciple will look at the master and think in his heart: If the master does not practice, why should I practice.

There will be various doubts, so it is very important to be consistent with your words and deeds.

After you have achieved the three ways, you can truly enter the tantric vehicle, the door, and enter the stage of tantric practice.

To practice the tantric vehicle, the first and foremost foundation is the bodhicitta aspiration for enlightnment. After attaining the bodhicitta, and then cultivating the tantra, becoming a Buddha or liberation will be faster.

—— "The Foundation of All Good Qualities"

Chapter 1 - Requirements for Practicing Tantric Buddhism 

Section 1 - Empowerment to learn Tantric Buddhism 

You must first receive the empowerment, and only after receiving the empowerment can one be qualified to practice Tantra.

When receiving empowerment, there needs to be a vajra master with the characteristics of great virtue. After finding such a master, one should seek empowerment from the master. After the master gives empowerment, one can practice the corresponding yidam dharma / Deity Yoga.

Don't rush to ask for empowerment before you learn the sutra part well, because, no matter what kind of empowerment, as long as you receive the empowerment, you must take the vows, at the very least, you must also take the bodhisattva vows, and you must strictly observe the vows after you receive them.

The four tantras have different vows.

Especially in Supreme Yoga, there are many vows, there are fourteen fundamental vows, eight falling vows, twenty-five five-way Buddha vows and so on.

After receiving the empowerment of the Supreme Yoga, one cannot break the vows;

If you break the vows, don't say you can't do it, the Buddha will be liberated and you will go to hell.

Therefore, after receiving the tantra empowerment, one should keep the vows just like protecting the eyes.

Now, many people who impart empowerment do not know if they are really qualified to impart empowerment, so they give empowerment to others willy-nilly.

Some disciples have no foundation at all, or don't even take refuge, so they just participate in the empowerment.

There is a prerequisite for receiving empowerment, one must first cultivate the lower path, then the middle path, and obtain renunciation in the middle path;

Then enter the Buddhist way to practice Bodhisattva, raise the mind, and only after attaining the Bodhichitta can one learn Tantra and receive empowerment. Bodhicitta is the foundation of entering Tantra.

For those who have not yet received empowerment, they can ask for it by making a vow and receive the empowerment.

For example, making a vow: 

May I receive the empowerment of the four deities in this life, be able to practice the Dharma door of the four deities, be able to be one, become a Buddha, and so on.

This is how we make a vow. We often say: 

The Buddhadharma is immeasurable, and we vow to learn it. Now that we have vowed, after practicing the Three Paths, if the vow is fulfilled and mature, there will be a chance to receive empowerment.

After receiving the empowerment, if you practice Tantra for the second time, you can obtain the achievement of the Consummation Stage.

The second section of the purification of the precepts is to cultivate the tantric vehicle. The tantric vehicle has the vows of the tantric vehicle. After receiving the empowerment, the vows must be purified.

If the vows of the tantra are not pure, they cannot be accomplished.

For example, if you have received the empowerment of the Supreme Yoga, you must practice every day, six yogas, and the contents of the six yogas are all precepts.

When receiving the six yogas and empowering, the blessing of the master's body, speech and mind is the blessing of the Buddha Tathagata's body, speech and mind, and the blessing of one's own body, speech and mind. This blessing will always remain on one's body.

At the same time as practicing the six yogas, one must also practice the four parts of Tantra, with signs, and without signs.

It is necessary to understand what yoga is with signs and without signs, and to practice it seriously.

You also need to learn the second step of the supreme yoga class. If not, if there is a broken vow, if you practice so diligently, you will be 100% successful in your lifetime.

If you receive empowerment, but do not practice the six yogas, then the empowerment will not work. It will be useless, it will still cause damage, and you will go to hell and evil realms in the future.

If the tantric vows can be kept, even if you don't practice any dharmas or disciplines, just practice the vows, you will definitely become a Buddha after being reborn sixteen times.

From this, it can be seen how extraordinary the tantric method is.

Therefore, after receiving the tantric empowerment, it is very important to keep the vows and purify yourself!

—— "Foundation of All Good Qualities"

**Chapter 2 - Tantric practice stage**

Tantra has four divisions: the division of affairs, the division of practice, the division of yoga, the supreme, and the division of yoga.

The first three are the lower secrets, and the latter are the supreme secrets.

The lower tantra is divided into yoga with signs and yoga without signs.

When you cultivate the lower tantra, you can also practice the longevity method at the same time. In this way, you can have enough time to practice the method and achieve the goal of becoming a Buddha.

The supreme yoga group includes the second stage, which is the generation stage and the perfection stage. If you practice it, it is the tantric method of the supreme yoga section. You don’t need to practice the longevity method, you can also become a Buddha.

The first stanza is the generation stage, which is the resource path in the five paths of tantra.

307

When practising the generation stage, the whole generation stage is to visualize oneself becoming a deity, and to visualize both birth and death.

When a person dies, there is a process, and the process of rebirth should be done according to this process, the process: when you die, you become the Buddha's Dharma body;

When the bardo body becomes a Buddha, the Sambhogakaya;

At birth, he became an incarnation of Buddha.

Use the three kayas to cultivate arising, step by step.

I will talk about it in detail in the future when I formally talk about the stages of arising.

**Section 2  - Perfection Stage**

After practicing the birth stage, then practice the perfection stage.

The consummation stage of tantra is the way of adding practice, seeing the way, cultivating the way, and not practicing the way.

The achievement of the complete stage of cultivation will be very fast, yes, it will be achieved in a lifetime.

When cultivating the stage of completion, it is to truly cultivate the clear point of the qi channel: the whole body, all the qi of the body enters the central channel.

This is the non-duality of emptiness and happiness. By practicing the Dharma, through the non-duality of emptiness and happiness, you can cut off the obstacles of affliction and knowledge and obstacles, and achieve success.

We haven't reached that level yet, so we won't talk about it in detail, and we're not allowed to talk about it in detail.

**Chapter 3  - Encountering the Difficulty of Secret Dharma** 

The second Buddha, Tsongkhapa's "Song of Enlightenment" says:

Here leads to the land of the Enlightened Buddha, 

the deep Vajrayana and Prajna,

The secret road of the two roads is more special and wonderful than the obvious road.

Known as the sun and the moon shining in the world, 

since I believe this is not a compliment,

What is the great tantric teaching, 

without discussing stealing the position of good knowledge,

If such a person has a discerning eye, 

who is more foolish than this?

It is especially rare to find the supreme way,

it is a pity to despise and give up!

Therefore, for the tantric vehicle, the supreme path of the Buddha, which is more difficult to meet than the Buddha,

Two kinds of siddhi's source secret treasure, in-depth long-term study and cultivation.

There are two schools of Mahayana Buddhism: 

Sutra and Tantra. 

The two methods, the door is like the sun and the moon, the tantric method is like the sun, and the sutra method is like the moon. There are some contents in the tantra that cannot be explained in the sutra; many things that the sutra does not explain are very clearly explained in the tantra. For example, the process of death is not explained in detail in the Sutras. As for the real liberation, the sutras only say that if you cut off afflictions, you will be liberated, and you will be liberated if you are freed from suffering. The real liberation and nirvana are not mentioned, but these are clearly explained in the tantras.

 Xianzong also only talked a little bit about the pure land of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas, but about the true and complete pure land of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas, the tantric schools explained very clearly.

As far as becoming a Buddha is concerned, according to the teachings of Xianzong, after you have developed bodhicitta, you must accumulate the blessings of the three great asamkhya kalpas, and you will have to reincarnate many times before you can become a Buddha. In the process of rebirth, in addition to bodhicitta Yes, in addition to merit, some merit will also be withdrawn. If we study Tantra, we can become Buddhas in one lifetime, without having to go through the three major asamkhya kalpas.

If he is the most outstanding Vajra disciple in Tantric Buddhism, he can become a Buddha in three years and three and a half months as quickly as possible; even an average disciple, after developing Bodhicitta, can become a Buddha in seven years by practicing Tantra. Or become a Buddha in ten or ten years; in this life, those who have not been able to become a Buddha can become a Buddha in the bardo stage. From this, we can see how special the secret method is, so the secret method is very precious, yes, it is very difficult to encounter.

Seeing the Buddha is a million times more difficult than encountering tantric law. During the whole period of sage kalpas, there will be a thousand Buddhas born together, preaching scriptures and teaching the Dharma, and Buddha Shakyamuni is the fourth Buddha. Among these thousand Buddhas, there is a double cultivation of tantric and tantric teachings, and the only known one is Shakyamuni Buddha.

It is predicted in the scriptures that the eleventh Buddha is the incarnation of Master Tsongkhapa. Whether this Buddha can teach tantric Dharma is not good at the moment. It is said that if you reason according to the power of the master's vows before becoming a Buddha, he will be able to speak. Secret, legal.

The fiftieth Buddha is Manjushri Bodhisattva coming again, so it is possible that he will teach the secret method.

The last thousandth Buddha made a vow: "Previously, how the nine hundred and ninety-nine Buddhas teach the Dharma, so do I."

Because of this, with this kind of willingness, it is possible to speak tantric methods.

In this case, only Buddha Shakyamuni taught the tantric Dharma, and there are three other Buddhas who could possibly speak the tantric Dharma, but none of them could be certain.

That is to say, in the best case, among the thousand Buddhas of the virtuous eons, only the teachings of the four Buddhas will have tantric teachings.

For the other nine hundred and ninety-six statues, the Buddha's teachings do not have tantric teachings.

Therefore, compared to seeing the Buddha and encountering the tantric law, encountering the tantric law is even more difficult.

Now, we have obtained a precious human body full of leisure, and it is not ordinary. We have not only encountered the Buddhadharma, but also met the teachings of the great master Tsongkhapa who cultivated perfection. This opportunity is very special and rare. It must be cherished and practiced seriously.

311

Master Tsongkhapa's praise:

The seven buddhas are wonderful and auspicious, deep and grand, and may my loving heart be long,

Spreading the Holy Teachings, Exotic and tantric Movements

Jumi Pang, a famous scholar of the Nyingma School, praised:

The ultimate truth of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas is emptiness and profound meaning,

Make the right credible theory who else but you

The Eighth Karmapa, leader of the Karma Kagyu School, praised:

When the evil winds of the Northern Buddha's Sacred Religion invaded and declined, 

exorcising evil and righting Tsongkhapa said the invincible Tsongkhapa

**Chapter 4 - The Greatness of Master Tsongkhapa's Teaching** 

We have already learned in the previous section that the right views held by the major schools in Tibet are different.

Many schools adhere to the dual practice of Mind-Only View and Tantra, or the dual practice of Madhyamika Self-Continued View and Tantra.

Our Gelug School, holding the Middle Way, should have a right view and practicing the tantric method, is very, very rare, rare.

Before he became a Buddha, Master Tsongkhapa made a vow that after becoming a Buddha, when turning the wheel of Dharma, he would only preach the dual cultivation of the Madhyamika Right View and the Tantra.

Before the Master Tsongkhapa was born, Nagarjuna Bodhisattva said to his disciples: 

"In the future, there will be a master who promotes both the right view of the Middle Way and the tantric practice, called Tsongkhapa, and you must vow to be his disciples. ."

Yue called the Bodhisattva, and also said to the disciples: "You must make a vow to be Tsongkhapa's disciples."

Maji Lazhun, who practiced the body method, also said to the disciples: "Tsongkhapa, Master will be born soon. He is the incarnation of Manjushri. You must vow to be the disciples of Master Tsongkhapa."

Many great siddhis have such prophecies, hoping that they or their disciples will be able to meet the teachings of Master Tsongkhapa.

In the past, there was a master named Buston Rinpoche in Tibet. He saw that the Buddha had prophecies about Master Tsongkhapa in many scriptures. Buston Rinpoche thought: Master Tsongkhapa and his teachings are like this. Special, victorious, difficult to meet, my lifespan is still more than ten years, if Master Tsongkhapa are born in a few years, we can wait until the birth of Master and then pass away.

Master Buston used the calendar to calculate the date of Master Tsongkhapa's birth based on the scriptures' prophecies. Originally, the calculation was six years later, but the Son of Heaven Demon added a zero and one. 

It will become sixty years, he thought disappointedly: My body can't wait, after sixty years, I vowed to be a disciple of Master Tsongkhapa.

He passed away, and in the sixth year after his death, Master Tsongkhapa was born.

Many great siddhas of the previous generation have taught Master Tsongkhapa, remember, Padmasambhava has also predicted Master Tsongkhapa several times, and advised his disciples to make a vow to be a disciple of Master Tsongkhapa, This is all because the Dharma door of Master Tsongkhapa is extremely rare.

The Fourth Panchen Lama is the incarnation of the second coming of Tsongkhapa, who is recognized in Tibet.

When a Geshe from Mongolia went to visit the Fourth Panchen Lama, he asked the Panchen Lama if he could obtain the precious human body of leisure in future generations. The fourth Panchen Lama said, "Yes, you can obtain the precious human body of leisure."

"Then can I become a preacher in my next life?", 

"Yes, yes."

"Then can I meet Master Tsongkhapa's Dharma?" After hearing this, the Fourth Panchen Lama pondered for a while.

Said: "This is more difficult, and it is possible to accumulate great blessings."

Therefore, the fact that we can meet Master Tsongkhapa's rectification shows that we are not ordinary blessings. We have great blessings, which are accumulated, and the blessings we have accumulated for countless kalpas are worth encountering. To cherish this dharma condition that only appeared in countless kalpas, diligently pracice, and be liberated in this life.

——"A Hymn of Experience (Lam rim nyam gur)"

Part 5 - practice, practice, second, first, "Treasures of the Dharma Sea" 

four pictures

This time, we talked about the Three Ways, that is, the Bodhi Way, No. 1, because the whole process of the Way is the Three Ways.

When practicing, it is best to have a Buddhist hall in your own home. In the Buddhist hall, there is an image of Sakyamuni Buddha or Master Tsongkhapa in the center, and images of other Buddhas and Bodhisattvas are placed around them.

Above the Buddha statue, there are scriptures, dharma books, the Diamond Sutra, and the Prajna Paramita Sutra, all of which should be offered on the Buddha altar.

When Buddha Shakyamuni taught the Theravada scriptures, Venerable Ananda came to offer the throne.

When teaching the Prajna Sutra, the Buddha himself offered his throne to him, because the Buddha also respected the Prajna Sutra.

Therefore, classics such as the Prajna Sutra, the Golden Sutra, and the Heart Sutra should be placed above the Buddha statues, and they should be highly respected.

After placing the Buddha statues and scriptures, make offerings.

If you have the conditions, you can make offerings of the eight offerings, the eight auspicious treasures, and the seven treasures of the Wheel King.

The eight offerings are water, oil, flowers, incense, lamps, tormas, incense sticks, and bells.

Without these conditions or due to inconvenience, simply use water, that is, several water cups are used for the offering.

After making offerings, earnestly pray and make vows.

For example, making a vow: "Today, God, I want to practice the order of the Dharma, and ask the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas to bless me, so that I can understand, reach the Dharma and meaning of the steps, and be able to achieve the Three Paths."

In this way, pray to get the inspiration of the Buddhas, Bodhisattvas and Guru Three Jewels.

After praying, sit in a cross-legged position and start to meditate.

If you can't sit cross-legged, you can sit wherever you want, even on the sofa.

First practice the Four Refuges, followed by the Seven Branches of Offerings, and then offer the Mandala.

Then start to practice getting close to the guru, visualize the root guru in front of yourself, first look at the guru carefully, and then think about it, how far your belief in the guru has reached, can you regard it as the guru? It is the Buddha, do you have the mind to think that the guru and the Buddha are indistinguishable?

If you don't have such a mind, you should pay attention to cultivating this mind. You can think more about the kindness of the guru, and then think about the merits of being close to the guru, and the sins of disobeying the guru.

Then pray: "With the inspiration of the Master, may I achieve the Three Paths."

Next, keep thinking that the guru is in front of you and continues to bless you.

After completing a practice, if you have cultivated well during visualization, you will feel that you have practiced well just now. At this time, you can visualize the teacher's face with a smile, his body glowing, and offer blessings for him.

If you feel that your cultivation is not good, you can visualize the master criticizing you, saying, "This is not good, you have to work harder."

And this encourages us to be diligent.

After getting close to the master, you should cultivate the rare view of the precious human body with time for leasure. Then, later, you should cultivate the view of the impermanence in life.

When cultivating the impermanence of life, think in your heart: "I may not live tomorrow. The only useful thing for future generations is the Dharma, so I must practice hard today."

Fear of impermanence arises, and having this fear helps to generate effort.

After cultivating the concept of impermanence in life, we can then contemplate the suffering of the three evil realms.

You should think like this in your heart: "If I die today, where can I go in the next life? One hundred percent will fall into the three evil realms, and what kind of pain will I experience in hell?"

Then visualize the scene and the pain of hell.

"What kind of pain does the hungry ghost experience? What kind of pain and suffering does the animal realm have?" Then visualize the scenes, pain and suffering of the hungry ghost realm and the animal realm separately.

When fear arises from the suffering of the Three Evil Realms, continue to think: "If I fall into the Evil Realms, no one can save me except the Three Jewels. I want to believe in the Three Jewels and take refuge in the Three Jewels."

Here we need to recite the Four Refuges a lot.

After reciting the Four Refuges, you continue to think: "Because I sincerely took refuge and took refuge in the Three Jewels, I will not fall into the evil realms in the next life.

However, if I don't respect cause and effect, the Three Jewels can't save me, the karma is unavoidable, and no one can do anything about it.

When Buddha Shakyamuni's family had karmic retribution, there was nothing the Buddha could do. "

Then think about cause and effect: "I have killed before, and today I will repent, and I will swear not to kill from now on."

So in my heart, I swear.

Think again about whether you have stolen anything, and then repent again.

In this way, one by one, think about the places where you have violated the ten good precepts, repent one by one, and make a vow that you will never violate them again.

After cultivating respect for cause and effect, think again: "Although I have obtained the precious human body of leisure and taken refuge in the Three Jewels, if in the next life, my son will only obtain the fruit of human and heaven, I still do not know where to reincarnate in the next life.

Therefore, in order to be liberated, we must cultivate the path of liberation. "

To cultivate the path of liberation, one must first cultivate renunciation, and the premise of cultivating renunciation is to contemplate the suffering of sentient beings in the six realms first.

Here we must first think about the suffering of the six realms, and then think about the suffering of the whole of samsara.

Think again about where the source of suffering lies. The source is vexation.

Then think about the **Twelve Links of Dependent Arising (Paṭicca-samuppāda)**:

the first is Ignorance;

The second is Volitional Formations, karma is the karma created by ignorance and afflictions;

The third is Consciousness, that is, the defiled soul;

The fourth is Materiality and Mentality;

The fifth is Six sense media;

The sixth is Contact;

The seventh is Feeling;

The eighth is Craving;

The ninth is Clinging;

tenth is Becoming / Existence;

Eleventh is Rebirth;

The twelfth is Aging and death.

The whole of the Twelve Links of Dependent Arising is a process of our rebirth.

If you think about this process, you will know that the root of samsara is suffering, and then you must think about ways to deal with big and small afflictions.

After contemplating and dealing with suffering, one will yearn for liberation and cultivate the path of liberation, which is morality, concentration, and wisdom.

To cultivate morality, concentration and wisdom, first of all, the vows must be pure. On the basis of the purity of the vows, then practice meditation. On the basis of meditation, cultivate the wisdom and wisdom of emptiness. This is the Middle Path.

After contemplating and cultivating the Middle Path, he continued to think: "Even though I have liberated myself by cultivating the Middle Path, I cannot help the living beings in the six realms to be liberated and freed.

"Because all sentient beings in the six realms are our own parents from beginningless kalpas, dear, we must help all sentient beings to liberate themselves.

At this time, you should think like this: "For the sake of sentient beings in the six realms, I want to cultivate the way of becoming a Buddha, and cultivate the way of the superior."

At the very beginning of Shangshi Dao was to cultivate equality among all beings.

Be more of yourself and think more:

"Don't be greedy for relatives and friends;

Do not be angry or hate the enemy;

Have equality for all beings. "

Think of it this way.

Then, on this basis, cultivate the seven branches of causality to generate bodhicitta, exchange from others, bodhichitta, and practice it repeatedly.

When you feel as if you have really gained a little bit of bodhicitta, you will begin to practice the six paramitas. At this time, you should contemplate the six paramitas or the ten paramitas.

Next, we will practice the four steps. In the four steps, we can cultivate what we can cultivate at the moment, and if we can’t cultivate, make a vow first, such as teaching the Dharma. Now that we are not yet capable of teaching the scriptures and teaching the Dharma, we make a vow: “May I have a teaching experience in the future. The ability to spread the Dharma through the scriptures, can teach the scriptures and impart the Dharma, and save sentient beings.”

After the Six Paramitas and the Four Steps are completed, you will need to practice the Vajrayana. If you have received the tantric empowerment, the first and foremost thing is to purify the precepts, that is, to persist in cultivating the precepts.

To practice the six yogas six times a day, we must recognize and truly contemplate the content of the six yogas.

Those who have not yet received the tantric empowerment can make a vow when they reach this point: 

"May I enter the tantric practice in the future, and be able to meet a vajra master with virtue and receive the tantric empowerment.

After receiving the empowerment, may my tantric vows be pure, do six yogas every day, and finally achieve the tantric method. "

In this way, from the worship of the Buddha statue, all the way to the Vajrayana, all the meditations are done.

The entire Bodhi path should be practiced at least once a day, which is equivalent to practicing all 84,000 Dharma doors once each.

In the process of meditation, a good habit will also be formed, and if you plant a very special seed, if you are very diligent in this life, you can achieve liberation.

If this is not achieved in this life, this extraordinary seed will soon germinate and grow in the next life, and it will be faster when you practice again, and it will finally be achieved.

The masters in the monastery also practice like this every day: in the morning class, they practice the "Outline of the Steps of the Path to Bodhi" once, then they practice the six-seat yoga three times, and then they practice one hundred mandala offerings.

After the hundred offerings are completed, some other methods will be practiced, such as the eulogy of the sixteen arhats, as well as some rituals.

In the evening class, the same is true. First, practice the Outline of the Steps of the Path to Bodhi. Then, practice the six-seat yoga three times, and then recite the Dharma Protector Ritual and make offerings to the Dharma Protector.

These are the real practices.

If family members do not have time to meditate on the San Shi Dao from beginning to end, they can meditate on some of the more important methods in the San Shi Dao, which will also increase great blessings and gain a lot of merit.

323

This time, I have condensed the steps of the Bodhi path from beginning to end. I hope that everyone will cut off their afflictions as soon as possible, get rid of suffering and attain happiness, and become Buddhas as soon as possible.

Let's contemplate together:

May this merit spread to all, 

and we and all sentient beings can achieve Buddhahood together

Tashi Delek! Tashi delek!

#### Introduction to Tuole Monastery 

The Tuole Monastery above the "lotus platform"

Tuole Monastery is a famous monastery belonging to the Gelug Sect of Tibetan Buddhism, located in the basin between the three grasslands of Muguitan, Balegetan and Dutan in Guinan County, Hainan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Qinghai Province.

The monastery is surrounded by mountains, facing Baiguan Pilgrimage Mountain, backed by Bailong Mountain, flanked by Long Mountain on the left and Phoenix Mountain on the right.

There are Turtle Mountain, Peacock Mountain, Elephant Mountain, Ba Jixiang Mountain, Foshou Mountain and other hills around like lotus petals. The monastery is located on the hill in the middle that rises like a lotus platform. between green water.

To the south of the temple, the Mangla River flows from south to north; to the north, the Yellow River flows from west to east.

There are three holy lakes to the northeast of the monastery, like three stars falling into the world.

The river is like a jade belt, and the holy lakes are like beads, protecting this Buddhist holy place.

In 1916, the incarnation of Vajrapani Bodhisattva, Master Tanchen Nuori, founded the Tuole Monastery.

The master recited the six-character mantra 600 million times for the construction of the temple, and recited the "Auspicious Sutra" to bless the consecration of the temple.

In 1927, the master passed away and was reborn as the 21st Dharma Master of the Pure Land of Shambhala.

To this day, the monks and believers in the monastery are still blessed by the Dharma Master.

In 2004, Guru Ngawang Gyatso began to rebuild the Tuole Monastery.

The pure precepts and perfect teachings of Tuole Monastery attract more and more monks to join.

Although this is a Gelugpa monastery, monks from various sects such as Nyingma, Kagyu, Sakya, and Joning have also gathered here to study and learn from each other.

Regarding the origin of the monastery, there have been many prophecies by the sages of the past dynasties.

On April 15, 1935, after drinking yogurt in the Potala Palace, the former Tibetan Regent Rezhen Rinpoche turned the porcelain bowl inside out and foretelled that the Tuole Monastery would become the same as the Tibetan Ganden Monastery, Drepung Monastery and Sera Monastery. The sacred place of Tibetan Buddhism is equally famous, and it is supported by believers from all over the world. In its heyday, the number of monks will reach 5,500.

The living Buddha left the monk's hat and the shoulders of the Dharma Master Yama as evidence.

**Tibetan-Chinese fusion of Tuole Temple**

The place where Tuole Monastery is today is called Jiarigang (meaning the place where the Han people are concentrated in Chinese), which means the integration of Tibetan and Chinese.

In 1916, when Tuole Temple was built, the donations for the construction of the temple were donated by believers from both Tibetan and Han areas.

At that time, there were more than 200 Tibetans and more than 400 Han people in the five villages where the Tuole Monastery was built.

During the "Cultural Revolution", Tuole Monastery was destroyed.

In 1981, Living Buddha Yigen rebuilt Tuole Monastery by the Yellow River with donations from Tibetan and Chinese believers.

In 1984, Yigen Living Buddha moved the Monastery to its current location.

In 2004, the new Mahavira Hall and Dharma Protector Hall started to be built by Master Ngawang Gyatso, which were also jointly built by Tibetan and Chinese believers.

Therefore, no matter the past or the present, Tuole Monastery is a testimony to the harmony between Tibetan and Chinese people.

The architecture of Tuole Monastery fully embodies the characteristics of the integration of Tibetans and Chinese.
