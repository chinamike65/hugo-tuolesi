[Auspicious Ode to Eliminate Miserliness] Three times

If any life is stingy to eradicate this defilement and make the heart be quiet without any harassment

The incomparable teacher leads all sentient beings into the wonderful path of liberation, declares all the wonderful Dharma Venerables, declares all the wonderful Dharma Venerates

The Buddha is the thing that all the people rely on for the benefit of all sentient beings, who should be satisfied and happy, and perform auspicious deeds for you.

Savior, you are kind-hearted towards all sentient beings, like an only son, always guarding you and doing auspicious deeds for you

Who is going to become a sentient being in reincarnation, become Nagisa and savior, and perform auspicious deeds for you

If all the dharmas are now pure and without deception

Wherever the great warriors are born, they will become perfect, and they will also be able to accomplish dharma deeds.

The places where the teacher was born and the forests are extremely shaken, so that all sentient beings are extremely happy and respectful to perform auspicious deeds for you

When approaching the Bodhi Vajra Throne, there are six kinds of motions that make the devil's heart uneasy.

When the Great Wheel of Dharma is turned, Hou Xuan expounds the subtle truths of all noble truths, can be benevolent and wonderful voices, transmits to the ears, and performs auspicious deeds for you

Dedicated to the World-Honored One, preaching the righteous Dharma, defeating all outsiders, subduing the multitude, and doing auspicious deeds for you

The Buddha prays for the auspiciousness of the Buddha, the auspicious emperor, the Brahma, the gods, and all the tribes, for your eternal blessings

The Buddha's blessings, mighty virtues, what all the gods think and force, what you want, what things are you willing to accomplish today

The two feet are full of auspiciousness

Auspicious day, auspicious night, auspicious sunshine

[Prajna Paramita Heart Sutra] Once

Noble Avalokiteśvara, the bodhisattva and great being, beheld the practice of the profound perfection of wisdom, and saw that the five aggregates are empty of nature. 

“O Śāriputra, a son of noble family or daughter of noble family who wishes to practise the profound perfection of wisdom should regard things in this way: they should see the five aggregates to be empty of nature."

Form is empty; emptiness is form. Emptiness is not other than form; form is not other than emptiness. 

In the same way, sensation, recognition, conditioning factors, and consciousness are emptiness.

[The reason for hearing the Dharma and the merits of hearing it]

The first part of the Dharma is based on good knowledge

Chapter 1 - The Principles of How to Practice in the Seat

How to move forward

To set up the holy image of the pure equanimity of the heart, in a word, what is said, heard, thought, and practiced in any way, you must be in the right mind. This is very important. Pure equanimity should be observed in the mind. Mother sentient beings, I must first attain Buddhahood and send out a special kindness to purify. At the same time, I recite the sweeping dust, remove dirt, and recite all the foundations. I hope that everything, such as rubble and gravel, will be pure and soft, such as the body of the palm that turns into bark glass. I wish to be pure. Sweeping the good virtues will remove all the two obstacles and habits that are known from the continual afflictions of other minds, and become the Buddha's fruit.

1. Pure Mind

2. He is pure

3. Protect the Dharma

All kinds of unwholesome things, such as comfort, honor, protection of relatives, and enemies should be eliminated. 

Thinking that I can only rely on the compassionate power of the Guru, the Three Jewels, to be able to enjoy my time. I have encountered the Buddhadharma, and I am fortunate to be accepted by virtuous and good teachers. 

The rare teaching of Tsongkhapa, the master of Manjushri, is really rare, so why is it difficult and even heaven collapses for the benefit of all mothers and sentient beings must take the Buddha's seat and should diligently practice the path and teach [Prajna Paramita Heart Sutra] seven times

Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva's deeds are deep in prajna (bō rě) when he sees the five aggregates are all empty and all sufferings are eliminated. The form is not different from the emptiness, and the form is not other than emptiness. Extinguishing, impurity, impurity, increase, and decrease; therefore, the sky has no color, no feeling, thoughts, actions, consciousness, no eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, mind, sound, scent, touch, dharma, no vision, or even the unconscious realm. No suffering, no path, no wisdom, no gain, no gain, so the bodhisattva relied on Prajna Paramita, so there was no hindrance in the heart, no hindrance, so there was no fear, far from upside-down dreams, and finally Nirvana III, all Buddhas depended on Prajna Paramita, so they attained Anuttara Samyaksambodhi therefore knows that Prajna Paramita is a great divine mantra, a great bright mantra, an unsurpassed mantra, an unparalleled mantra, and it can remove all suffering. It is true and true, so saying the Prajna Paramita mantra means saying the mantra,

In front of the Refuge Realm, there is a relatively vast space in the sky. There are eight steed lions on the high and vast thrones. On the lotus, moon, and sun wheel cushions, there is a body. With one side and two arms, the right hand is pressed to the ground, the left hand is fixed, and the bowl is flat and the bowl is filled with nectar. The masters are seated around the sects. The lineage masters of each school gradually sit around the four deities, the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas, the brave mother, the dakini, the dakini, and the dharma protectors. Naturally chanting the deep and broad Dharma sound, the Lord and all his relatives all face themselves with compassion, joy, joy, mother on the left, father on the right On the joy and joy of myself and the fierce reverence arising from the remembrance of his merits and great compassion, I think that I and all sentient beings like mothers are bound by delusion and karma. There is nothing else to do to save and rescue all the sentient beings like mothers, who are free from the suffering of samsara and set on the path of liberation. I sincerely pray that all the saints in the refuge state recite the Refuge Master in unison from all sentient beings around him [One hundred and eight times] Visualization The guru can benevolent and directly connected to the dharma.

Especially, it is called by the good knowledge of body, speech, and mind. Blessings are integrated into their own body and mind, so that they can be mercifully absorbed without losing their previous thoughts, recite the merits and virtues of the guru, and recite the Buddha’s Refuge, the Dharma, and the Sangha. All the sins and obstacles that have been committed in the past, especially the destruction of the body and mind, are mortgaged and sold Buddha statues and Buddhas.

From what he said, all the sins and obstacles created by the law will be purified, and the body will become clear and bright.In particular, it is said that all sentient beings, body and mind, are protected by the Dharma from the blessing of the Dharma, and those who have been karmic obstacles created by the monks are called the pilgrims of the monks, the stealing of the monks, the theft of the monks’ food, the brokenness of the monks, the purification of all the sins committed by the monks, and the repentance. The Buddhas and Bodhisattvas have great compassion and blessings, accept and take refuge with the guru, the deity, the Three Jewels, and visualize the three jewels.

【Twenty-one times】

Refuge and Refuge From the periphery of the Refuge Realm to the inward, all the deities are merged one by one in the Nengren and Nengren, and the boundless rays of light shine on all sentient beings. The karma of all sentient beings is eliminated. When Shakyamuni Buddha recited Shakyamuni's heart mantra "Om muni muni mahamuni Shakyamuni svaha.", the mantra wheel in his heart emits immeasurable rays of light to eliminate all sentient beings' karma and suffering, and visualize the victory clearly. The "win" of the grain field is better than the victory in the grain field. Each statue in the grain field is the totality of the Guru's Three Jewels, so it is called the victory of the grain field. The refuge is different from the victory field. One is to visualize the Buddha. There is a little difference in the way of the bodhisattva. The second is to visualize the Buddha and Bodhisattva in the refuge state. You don’t need to invite them over. You don’t need to integrate into the field of victory. Buddhas and Bodhisattvas are all living visualizations. In front of them, there are eight steed lions holding up a high and vast throne in the sky. On the back are eight lions holding a small lotus flower, moon, sun, and wheel cushion. Sakyamuni sits on the cushion. The root master has a golden head, a top bun, one side, two arms, the right hand, and the Dharma seal. The left hand holds a bowl with a knot, and the bowl is filled with nectar. The master who sits in the seat can shine light in the heart of benevolence equal to the number of teachers and leaders. The light end is on the lion seat of the lotus and the moon is seated in the middle. Victory King King Kong is sitting around. The lineage guru radiates light to the left in the lotus seat, sits around Manjushri, and sits around the very deep view. All the masters shine forward and shine on the lion. The Buddhas and Bodhisattvas, brave fathers and mothers, were born in the world, protectors of the Dharma The top door of the main deity's retinue has a white "Om" character, a red "Ah" character between the throat, a blue "Hung" character at the umbilicus, a green "Ha" character at the dense part, and the green "Ha" character is clear and bright. Shine light in the place of self-nature to welcome you, please cultivate the wisdom as you see it, and recite it. May all sentient beings and great supporters destroy the army of demons and their retinues. Each oath is indistinguishable and indistinguishable. If you take a bath, you should look at it like this. In front of the green grass, the wonderful flowers are decorated with all kinds of precious trees. There is a bathing palace surrounded by many treasures. Square bathSands is the bottom, full of fragrant and fragrant water. There are three steps on each side of the bath. There are food fields in the palace. The lions recite this wonderful bathroom. I want to feed the food field, the saints' clothes and ornaments are hung on the branches of various treasures, and they enter the room in order and sit on the constellation Leo. It is filled with nectar water, and the nectar water is slowly poured on the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas to bathe and recite the deities in the grain field. It is like the gods and gods bathing in the Buddha's birth. Now I also fill the grain field

This verse says that the body bows down, visualizes oneself, and transforms into a body equivalent to the number of dust particles in a Buddha field. The Buddhas and Bodhisattvas of the ten directions and three times represented by the grain field are brave fathers, brave mothers, dakinis, and dakinis. According to the recitation of as many Buddhas in a single dust, there are as many Buddhas as dust in a single dust. In the endless Dharma realm in the assembly of the Bodhisattva, I am convinced that all the Buddhas are filled with this verse. It means that the mind bows and contemplates that there are as many dusts on the dust. All the Buddhas are surrounded by the Bodhisattva. Live in peace and remember that the saints started from the beginning to seek the realization of the supreme Bodhi, starting from the principle of learning the Tao and accumulating resources, and even now, the reason why the body, speech, mind, and career have inconceivable merits, so from there, I have pure faith and adhere to them. I think that rescue will never be deceived, correct and correct, I will win and solve my faith, relying on my goodness and strength, I will not wait for a long time, and I will now prove how good his merits are The wonderful sound of the words will be exhausted in all future kalpas to praise the Buddha's deep sea of ​​merits and virtues. This verse says to bow down to the Buddha's merits and praises inexhaustible. Visualize your own body and transform into a mote of dust. There are countless tongues, each with infinite subtle rhythms, singing and chanting the merits of the three secrets of the Buddhas, and at the same time, they can understand the sentient beings around them.

[three] repentance

Thinking about the sins I have committed without beginning, like the treasury of a great king, it is limitless and boundless. Only in terms of killing a single life, I can't count on this life. Although the three laws are widely accepted, I think to myself that I have never remembered that if I keep a single precept, I can purify this time if I die and die. There is nowhere to go to decide that there is only hell. Because of this, I will now commit all the sins that have been created by the three poisons since the beginning and even now. Bless and pray so that all sins are degraded and purified, and I swear that I will never recite from now on until the end of my life. repent

Visualize and pray that the Dharma protectors, especially the six-armed lord, the Dharma King Yama, incarnate so many wrathful beings, who will happily sing, "Good man, you, etc., for transgression, I will banish everything." According to the reason, I undertake the words, and use the sharp weapons and flames to remove all the obstacles, the outer and the inner, the inner and the secret, and all the wrathful beings are melted into themselves and have overcome all the wrongs. Because of this, I have a bold and fearless heart and recite all the merits and virtues.

All the sins and obstacles accumulated by the body of the beginningless come to be purified. Because of this, the blessings of all the honored bodies are obtained. After receiving the empowerment from this aquarium, the good karmic power of the Buddha's incarnation, visualize the red word "ah" in the throats of all the people, let the red light pour red nectar into the throat, and purify all the sins created by the words. Respect the blessings of the many languages ​​and receive this secret empowermentTo obtain the good karmic power of the Buddha’s Sambhogakaya, visualize the formation of a blue hum in the hearts of all the people, release the blue light, and pour blue nectar into the hearts. And because of this wisdom empowerment, I obtained the good karmic power of the Buddha Dharma body, and visualized that the hearts of all the top doors emit white, red and blue light at the same time, and the three-color nectar is poured into the three doors. Therefore, the blessings of the three gates of the saints and the good karmic power of the double body due to the empowerment of this sentence. Incorporating the two kinds of achievements when reciting the original is to obtain the samaya of the pure law All the lineage masters transform into one body form one by one and merge into their own body. Obstacles to enlightenment, etc. are all cleaned up, so the mind continues to arise in the second and second generation. Virtues are recited as teachers teach, practice vows, blessings, visualizations, visualizations, and lineages of the Guangxing School. One by one Incorporating the recitation of vows, such as the wonderful Taoist master and the right practitioner In the hearts of all Dharma protectors, a white goddess emerges, holding a white treasure vase full of nectar and bathing themselves from head to toe. All the faults, diseases, and demonic obstacles are purified by this. In the mind of the Dharma protector, a yellow celestial girl, holding a yellow treasure vase, takes a bath, etc. As mentioned above, because of this, one's own life expectancy, merits, etc., are enlarged, visualized, practiced, and held in the mind of the Dharma protector. The red goddess held a red iron hook and threw it at the sentient beings who wanted to teach and enlighten them. They were called to kneel under their feet, respectful, obedient, visualized, held the "kill" Dharma and poured nectar to wash off sins. All the demonic hindrances in my heart have been burnt away, and the remaining smoke is curling up. If there is a fierce and difficult person to control, all the Dharma protectors shall use the staff, axe, bone stick, etc., to destroy them. One transforms into one body and integrates into one's own body, and integrates into chanting, praying, and praying for life without leaving the teacher.Visualize all the lineage masters of the Guangxing School, one by one, transform into one body and merge into their own body. At this time, I should know that all the saints in the field of resources are actually transformed by the teacher's kindness and kindness. 

I pray that I will not be separated from the teacher's kindness and kindness. The hum character emits light and shines all around the peaceful and wrathful saints, making it into a clear and bright body, and gradually transforming into light from the outside to the inside. I deeply see that all teachers are integrated in Manjushri practice, blessings are integrated into King Kong Zongzhi, and all teachers are integrated into the root. At this time, the teacher should stay for a moment and visualize the five statues. The teacher melts into the heart of the vajra holding the self-energy benevolence top door, and descends to the heart with wisdom and Satan. The king of benevolence reintegrated into the top gate root guru The root guru transformed into the Nengren vajra general holder as the body of the triple saṅsa, the nature of the lion, the lotus, the sun, the moon, the wheel cushion, the nature of self-kindness, the root guru, the king of Sakyamuni, the king of benevolence while sitting

Exhausting all the seas of the ten directions - one Maoduan three seas

The sea of ​​Buddha and the sea of ​​land

All the words of the Tathagata are pure and one word has a sea of ​​voices

Follow all the business music, a first-class Buddha's eloquence

All things in the three worlds come from the endless sea of ​​language

Dharma of constant transformation, interesting and wonderful

I can go deep into the future and do everything for a single thought

All the eons in the three worlds are one thought and I will enter

In a single thought, I saw all the people in the three worlds, teachers and children

Also often enter the realm of the Buddha, such as the illusion of liberation and power

In a very small amount of hair, the three-generation solemn brake appeared

All the hairs in the dust brakes of the ten directions are deep and pure.

All the future enlightenment of the world, enlightenment, enlightenment and enlightenment

After all, the Buddha's work shows Nirvana, I will all go to and get close

Quickly, all around, the power of supernatural power

Wisdom, practice, common practice, merit, power, power

All-Pure, Adorable, Victory, Blessed, Unattached, Unreliable, Wisdom

Concentration, Wisdom, Convenience, Power, Divine Power, Universal Ability to Accumulate Bodhi Power

Purify all good karma and destroy all afflictions

Surrender to all the magic powers

Universally purifying the seas of all realms and liberating the seas of all sentient beings

Goodness can distinguish the sea of ​​dharmas can go deep into the sea of ​​wisdom

Universally able to purify the sea of ​​actions and complete the sea of ​​all wishes

Get close to the sea of ​​offerings to all Buddhas, practice the sea of ​​untiring sutras

All the Tathagatas of the Three Worlds are the Most Victorious Bodhisattvas and Vows

I make offerings to perfect cultivation, practice the Samantabhadra and realize Bodhi

All the Tathagatas have the eldest son whose name is Puxianzun

I now dedicate my devotion to the roots of goodness, wishing all wisdom and deeds to be with him

May body, speech and mind be ever-purifying and the realms of all deeds be restored.

If the wisdom is called Puxian, may I be equal to them

I practice Manjushri's great vows for the sake of the universal and pure Samantabhadra

Full of his career is endless, the future is endless, the calamity is endless

I have practiced immeasurably and gained immeasurable merits

Abiding in immeasurable actions, attaining all supernatural powers

Manjushri is brave, wise, wise and virtuous

I am now devoting myself to the roots of goodness to follow them all to practice and study

The Buddhas of the three worlds exclaimed such a great vow

I dedicate my devotion to the roots of goodness in order to obtain the supreme deed

May I remove all obstacles when I want to die

When you meet the Buddha Amitabha, you will be reborn in a place of peace and happiness

I have been born in that country and have now fulfilled this great wish

Everything is perfect, there is no excess, benefit and pleasure, all sentient beings

When the assembly of the Buddhas purifies me, I am victorious in the lotus life

Before witnessing the immeasurable light of the Tathagata, teach me the Bodhisattva

Mengbi Tathagata's prophecy has been incarnated without hundreds of corpses

Wisdom is vast and pervades all sentient beings in the ten directions and Puli

Even the empty world is exhausted of all sentient beings and karmic afflictions

If everything is endless, I wish it would be endless

All the boundless temples in the ten directions adorn the many treasures for the Tathagata

The best of all

If one wins the wish here, the king will be able to believe in his ears.

Victory Bodhicitta desires the merits of victory more than others

That is, always stay away from evil knowledge, stay away from all evil realms

Quickly see the immeasurable light of the Tathagata, this Samantabhadra's greatest wish

This person is good at surpassing lifespan

This person will soon achieve the deeds of Samantabhadra Bodhisattva

In the past, the worst evils were created by the power of lack of wisdom.

Reciting this Samantabhadra's great wish, the king will be wiped out as soon as he reads it

Kind of family name and appearance, good wisdom and perfection

All demons and outsiders cannot be destroyed but can be supplied by the Three Realms

Hastened to the Bodhi Tree King Sitting and has already subdued all the demons

Achieving full enlightenment, turning the Dharma wheel, and all the comprehensions

If one is here, Samantabhadra is willing to recite, uphold and speak

As a result, only the Buddha can realize the Bodhi path that determines victory.

If people recite this Samantabhadra, may I speak of the good roots of a small fraction

With a single thought, everything can be fulfilled and the pure wish of sentient beings can be fulfilled

My virtuous deeds, boundless and blessed, are all dedicated

I wish that all sentient beings who are addicted to go to the Buddha realm of immeasurable light quickly

[Prayer for good after junior high school] once

Persistently practising altruism and persevering in the pursuit of good teachers

Just like the constant cry and obedience to the Dharma, not being shaken by the use of life

Skillfully pleasing the supreme good teacher does not make him unhappy even for a moment

May I resolve the deep solitude, the drama of prajna, and the righteousness not to be polluted by water

Just like teaching the Bodhisattva, I pray that he will teach me forever

Those who disobey the secret intention of being able to be benevolent and proclaim the creator of constant renunciation of evil views

Those wicked friends and wicked teachers may not follow in all times

May you raise the purity and increase your mind, and let your sails ride on the wind of perseverance and perseverance.

The boat that has sailed cleverly, heard, thought, and repaired has rescued sentient beings from the sea of ​​reincarnation

May I purify the precepts and the wisdom of wisdom with the generosity that is enriched by the great learning

All make my heart grow and grow away from all irrationality and humility

May I choose the truths of the classics with a pure and clear intelligence

Always stay by the side of the wise and listen to the boundless sutras

Wherever you think, what you think will become wisdom, completely eliminate doubts and leave no trace

May I attain the wisdom and steadfast solution of the profound and wonderful Dharma and all the right principles

Abandon the entanglements of this world, make diligent efforts, and practice according to Alan Ruo.

I pray that when I hear the secrets of the victor's secret thoughts,

Do not love the three have greed for this world and can not afford any desire to be happy

May I be free from greed and stingy with all my possessions

First, use wealth to benefit all sentient beings as dependents and satisfy them with laws

May I attain the realization of Bodhisattva by renunciation and contemplation in all the subtle learnings I have received

Even for the sake of life, never give up lightly, always uphold the jewel of liberation

May all the beatings expose my faults and let everyone see or read my name

Let go of anger, I would like to widely publicize their merits and cultivate peace and forbearance

Pray that those who have not obtained the good things that have not been obtained will grow widely

Completely cut off the three slack in practice, get up immediately, work diligently and diligently

May I be far away from the added insight of the edge of existence, away from the added sorrow of the edge of silence

Cut off all energy and lead to the stillness of the three existences

May it be the best to break the fear, the deep truth, and break the mind and emptiness

All upside-down wrong views are abandoned

May you keep the pure precepts, stay away from a worthy conscience, and do not create fear of the holy ones

Break the precepts and still keep the ascetic practices, I would like to make them without fault

May those who stray from the right path and go astray turn with evil knowledge and evil friends

No matter what, I would like to place them smoothly in the Buddha's praise

May the lion's roar of my lectures and essays take over the eloquence of the evil foxes

It is convenient to tame and ingest it. It has propped up the invincible treasure tower of the teaching method.

May I be able to taste and drink the wonderful nectar of the teachings of Nengren, where I was born

With caste, appearance, wealth, power, intelligence, longevity, health and well-being

Anyone who has always had intentions of hurting my life and resources

And all those who slander me badly, I would like to treat them as lovingly as a mother

I would like to practice loving others over oneself bodhicitta soon among them

Raised the pure and enhanced joy

May those who see or hear or remember these prayers

Cultivation of the Buddha, the great vows of the great and the courageous, not retreating, everything will be accomplished

May this power be cultivated well with the power of pure and high will

Fulfilling your wishes, landing on the other shore, and fulfilling all the wishes of all sentient beings

Everyone repents of all sins, all merits and virtues are rejoicing

I now urge all Buddhas and vows to attain the supreme wisdom

The past, the future, the present, the Buddha is the most supreme among all beings

Admiring the boundless sea of ​​merit, I now put my palms together and take refuge

There are three kinds of physical karma, and four kinds of oral karma

And the three karma and ten unwholesome repentance

From the beginning to the present, the ten evils are endless

The heart follows the root of troubles and all sins are repented

All the evil deeds I have done in the past are caused by endless greed, hatred and ignorance

I now repent of everything that was born from my body, speech, and mind

All compliments and offerings, please turn the wheel of Dharma with joy

I dedicate the good deeds I have accumulated to the Great Bodhi of Perfection
