#### 菩提道次第广论

Homage to the guru Mañjughosa.

南无姑如曼殊廓喀耶 （梵语）

敬礼尊重妙音 (汉译)

I bow my head to the chief of the Sakyas, whose body was formed by ten million perfect virtues, whose speech fulfills the hopes of limitless beings, whose mind sees precisely all objects of knowledge.

俱胝圆满妙善所生身，成满无边众生希愿语，

如实观见无余所知意，于是释迦尊主稽首礼

I bow down to Ajita [Maitreya] and to Mañjughosa, the supreme heirs of the unequaled teacher [the Buddha]. Having assumed the burden of all the Conqueror's deeds, they emanate in innumerable buddha-realms.

是无等师最胜子，荷佛一切事业担，

现化游戏无量土，礼阿逸多及妙音

I bow to the feet of Nāgārjuna and Asanga, Thoroughly renowned throughout the three levels, Ornaments of Jambudvipa' who wrote exact commentaries on the intent Of the Mother of Conquerors, so difficult to fathom.

如极难量胜者教，造释密意赡部严，

名称遍扬于三地，我礼龙猛无着足

I bow to Dipamkara [Atisha], bearer of the treasury of instructions that comprise the key points, unmistaken and complete, of the paths of the profound view and vast deeds, transmitted well from those two great trailblazers. 

摄二大车善传流，深见广行无错谬，

圆满道心教授藏，敬礼持彼然灯智

I bow with respect to the teachers who, with deeds of skill in means moved by loving concern, illuminate for the fortunate the gateway leading to liberation, the eye for viewing all the limitless scriptures. 

遍视无央佛语目，贤种趣脱最胜阶，

悲动方便善开显，敬礼此诸善知识

Nowadays those making effort at yoga have studied few [of the classic texts], 

while those who have studied much are not skilled in the key points of practice, 

they tend to view the scriptures through the eyes of partisanship, 

unable to use reason to discriminate the meaning of scriptures. 

今勤瑜伽多寡闻，广闻不善于修要，

观视佛语多片眼，复乏理辩教义力

Therefore, having seen that they lack the path pleasing to the wise, 

the supreme complete instructions, the key points of the teaching, 

I was inspired to explain
this path of the great trailblazers. 

故离智者欢喜道 圆满教要胜教授 

见已释此大车道 故我心意遍勇喜。

All those fortunate ones who are unobscured by the darkness of partisanship, 

who have the mental capacity to differentiate good and bad, 

and who wish to make meaningful this good life and leisure

should listen with one-pointed attention. 

诸有偏执暗未覆，具辨善恶妙慧力，

欲令暇身不唐捐，诸具善者专励听。

1. contain the key points of all of the Conqueror's scriptures, 

2. are the pathways forged by two great trailblazers, Nagarjuna and Asanga, 

◎ 此中总摄一切佛语扼要，遍摄龙猛无着二大车之道轨。

3. are the system for supreme beings progressing to the state of omniscience, and

4. fully comprise all the stages practiced by the three types of persons. 

往趣一切种智地位胜士法范，三种士夫，一切行持，所有次第，无所缺少。

The scholars of glorious Nalanda are said to have explained the teaching by way of three purities - the purity of speech of the master, the purity of mind of the disciple, and the purity of the teaching that will be explained. 

胜那兰陀诸智论师，许由三种清净门中，

诠释正法。谓轨范语净，学者相续净，

所说法清净。

At a later time (the teaching spread to Vikramalasila) it is said that it was important for its scholars to begin with three topics: 

彼诸智者，则许三种而为初要。

the greatness of the author of the teaching; 

the greatness of the teaching; 

and how one should explain and listen to that teaching. 

谓正法造者殊胜，正法殊胜，如何讲闻彼法规理。

This explanation of the stages of the path to enlightenment has four parts: 

由是菩提道次引导分四：

1. Showing the greatness of the teaching's author in order to establish that it is of noble origin. 

2. Showing the greatness of the teaching in order to engender respect for the instructions

3. How to listen to and explain the teachings. 

4. How to lead students with the actual instructions. 

① 为显其法根源净故开示造者殊胜，

② 令于教授起敬重故开示其法殊胜，

③ 如何讲闻二种殊胜相应正法，

④ 如何正以教授引导学徒之次第。

These instructions, in general, are those of the 《Ornament for Clear Knowledge》, composed by the venerable Maitreya. 

◎ 总此教授，即是至尊慈氏所造，《现观庄严》所有教授。

In particular, the text for this work is Atisha's 《Lamp for the Path to Enlightenment》; 

hence, the very author of the 《Lamp for the Path to Enlightenment》 is also the author of this work. 

别则此之教典，即是菩提道炬。故彼造者，亦即此之造者。

The other name by which the great master Dipamkarasrijnana is widely renowned is the glorious Atisha.

彼复即是大阿阇黎胜然灯智，别讳共称阿底峡。

Showing the greatness of the teaching's author in order that it is of noble origin. 

1. How he took rebirth in an excellent lineage

2. How upon that basis he gained good qualities. 

3. Having gained those good qualities, what Atisha did to further the teachings. 

其殊胜分三，

① 圆满种中受生事理，

② 其身获得功德事理，

③ 得已于教所作事业。今初

Dro-lung-ba said that at age fifteen, after hearing Dharmakirti's Drop of Reasoning one time, Atisha debated with a famous scholar, a non-Buddhist logician, and defeated him, whereby his fame spread everywhere.

特如大卓龙巴云：

十五岁时，仅闻一次正理滴论，

与一黠慧戏论外道兴辩，令彼堕伏美誉遍扬。

How upon the basis he gained good qualities: 

1 How, knowing many texts, he gained the good qualities of scriptural knowledge. 

2. How, engaging in proper practice, he gained the good qualities of experiential knowledge. 

获得功德事理分二：

① 知见广博获教功德事理，

② 如理修行获证功德事理。

C. Having gained those good qualities, what Atisha did to further the teachings

于圣教所作事中

Furthermore, there are three ideal qualifications for an author of texts that elucidate the intent of the Sage in this way.

◎ 如是造论，光显能仁所有密意。复有三种圆满胜因，

The author 

(1) should have mastered the five topics of knowledge; 

谓善所知五种明处

(2) should possess instructions

具教授

that are the key points for practicing the meaning of the topics of Buddhist knowledge which have been transmitted in an unbroken lineage through excellent beings from the perfect Buddha; 

谓从正遍知展转传来，于其中间善士未断修持彼义扼要教授，

and (3) should receive permission to compose the text in a vision of his or her chosen deity. 

并得谒见本尊天颜，获言开许。

Concerning the teaching to be explained, the root text of these instructions is the 《Lamp for the Path to Enlightenment》. There are many texts composed by the Elder, but the 《Lamp for the Path to Enlightenment》 is comprehensive and fundamental. 

◎ 显示法殊胜中，法者，此教授基论，谓《菩提道炬》。依怙所造，虽有多论，然如根本极圆满者，厥为《道炬》。

Since it teaches by drawing together the key points of both the sūtra and mantra vehicles, its subject matter is comprehensive;

具摄经咒所有枢要而开示故，所诠圆满。

since it emphasizes the stages of disciplining the mind, it is easy to put into practice; 

调心次第为最胜故，易于受持。

and since it is adorned with the instructions of two gurus who were skilled in the systems of the two great trailblazers, it is superior to other systems.

又以善巧二大车轨，二师教授而庄严故，胜出余轨。

The greatness of the teaching is indicated by four qualities it elicits in the student: 

此论教授殊胜分四：

1. Knowing that all of the teachings are free of contradiction. 

2. Coming to understand that all of the scriptures are instructions for practice. 

3. Easily finding the Conqueror's intent. 

4. Automatically refraining from great wrongdoing. 

① 通达一切圣教无违殊胜，

② 一切圣言现为教授殊胜，

③ 易于获得胜者密意殊胜，

④ 极大罪行自趣消灭殊胜。

A. The greatness of enabling one to know that all of the teachings are free of contradiction. 

今初

With regard to the teachings, Avalokitavrata's Commentary on the "Lamp for Wisdom" says: 

Concerning "teachings," the scriptures of the Bhagavan accurately teach that which is to be thoroughly known, that which is to be eliminated, that which is to be manifested, and that which is to be cultivated by deities and humans who wish to attain the ambrosial state [of a nonabiding nirvâna]. 

◎ 圣教者，如《般若灯广释》中云：

“言圣教者，谓无倒显示，诸欲证得甘露胜位，若人若天，所应遍知，所应断除，所应现证，所应修行。”

Thus the teachings are what the Conqueror explained well. 

即薄伽梵所说至言。谓尽胜者所有善说。

Here, [in the context of the 《Lamp for the Path to Enlightenment》] to know that all the teachings are free of contradiction means to understand that they are the path by which one person becomes a buddha. 

◎ 达彼一切悉无违者，谓于此中解了是一补特伽罗成佛之道，

Some are the main points of the path; some are the various branches of the path. 

此复随其所应，有是道之正体，有是道之支分。”

Bodhisattvas make it their goal to accomplish the good of the world [all living beings]. Since bodhisattvas must take care of students who are followers of all three lineages [those of Śrāvakas, pratyekabuddhas, and bodhisattvas], they must train in the paths of those three lineages.

此中诸菩萨所欲求事者，谓是成办世间义利，亦须遍摄三种种性所化之机，故须学习彼等诸道。

For, as Nāgārjuna's Essay on the Spirit of Enlightenment says: Because they engender in others certain knowledge that accords with their own, the wise apply themselves always and without mistake. 

如《释菩提心论》云：“如自定欲令，他发决定故，诸智者恒应，善趣无谬误。”

And, Dharmakirti's 《Commentary on the "Compendium of Valid Cognition"》 says:

《释量》亦云：

It is difficult to explain to others the results of causes that are obscure to oneself.

“彼方便生因，不现彼难宣。”

Therefore, if you have not ascertained something exactly, you cannot teach it to others. 

自若未能如实决定，不能宣说开示他故。

Ajita indicates in the 《Ornament for Clear Knowledge》 that knowing the paths of the three vehicles is the method for bodhisattvas to achieve the goal they have set. 

阿逸多云：“诸欲饶益众生，由道种智成办世间利。”

Also the Mother of Conquerors [The EighteenThousand-Verse Perfection of Wisdom Sūtra) says: 

《胜者母》中亦云：

Bodhisattvas should produce all paths—whatever is a path of a Śrāvaka, a pratyekabuddha, or a buddha—and should know all paths. They should also perform the deeds of these paths and bring all of them to completion. 

“以诸菩萨应当发起一切道，应当了知一切道，谓所有声闻道，所有独觉道，所有佛陀道。如是诸道亦应圆满，亦应成办诸道所作。”

Thus, it is contradictory to propound that you should not train in the scriptural collections of the Hinayana because you are a Mahāyāna practitioner. 

故有说云：是大乘人故，不应学习劣乘法藏者，是相违因。

There are shared and unshared paths to enter the Mahāyāna. Since the shared are those things that come from the scriptural collections of the Hinayana, how could they be something to set aside? Therefore, Mahāyāna followers must practice all those things taught in the Hinayana scriptural collections, with only a few exceptions, such as diligently seeking a blissful peace for oneself alone. This is the reason for extensively teaching all three vehicles in the very vast scriptural collections of the bodhisattvas. 

◎ 趣入大乘道者，有共不共二种道。

共者即是劣乘藏中所说诸道，此等何因而成应舍，故除少分希求独自寂静乐等不共者外，所余一切，虽大乘人亦应修持。

故诸菩萨方广藏中，广说三乘，其因相者，亦即此也。

Furthermore, 
◎ 复次

a perfect buddha has not extinguished just a portion of faults and accomplished a mere portion of good qualities, 

正遍觉者，非尽少过，圆少分德，

but rather has extinguished all types of faults and accomplished all types of good qualities. 

是遍断尽一切种过，周遍圆满一切种德，

Mahāyāna practitioners seek to achieve this. Since they will then eliminate all faults and develop all good qualities, all the different types of good qualities derived from the elimination of faults

能成办此所有大乘亦灭众过备起众德，

all the different types of good qualities derived from the elimination of faults

能成办此所有大乘亦灭众过备起众德，

and the acquisition of knowledge within every other vehicle are included in the Mahāyāna path. 

【故大乘道遍摄一切余乘所有断证德类。

Therefore, every scripture is included as a branch of the Mahāyāna path for achieving buddhahood. 

是故一切至言，悉皆摄入成佛大乘道支分中，

For, there is no saying of the Sage that does not extinguish some fault or develop some good quality, 

以能仁言，无其弗能尽一过失，或令发生一功德故。

and, of all those, there is none that a Mahayana practitioner does not practice. 

又彼一切大乘，亦无不成办故。

Qualm: 

◎ 设作是云：

In order to enter the perfection vehicle of the Mahāyāna, you do need the paths that are explained in the Hinayana scriptural collections.

 However, in order to enter into the Vajrayāna, the paths of the perfection vehicle are not shared in common with the paths of the Vajrayāna, because the paths are incompatible. 

若入波罗蜜多大乘，虽须劣乘法藏，所说诸道。

然于趣入金刚乘者度彼岸乘，所有诸道非为共同，道不顺故。

Reply: This too is most unreasonable. 

此极非理，

The substance of the path of the perfection vehicle comprises

以度彼岸道之体性，悉皆摄入，

the thought that is the development of the spirit of enlightenment and the deeds of training in the six perfections. 

意乐，谓于菩提发心；行，谓修学六到彼岸。是则一切定应习近。

That those must be relied upon on all occasions is set forth in the Vajra Climax Tantra: Even to save your life, Do not give up the spirit of enlightenment. 

And: The deeds of the six perfections should never be cast aside. Further, such is said in many tantric texts.

如胜金刚顶云：“纵为活命故，不应舍觉心。”又云：“六度彼岸行，毕竟不应舍。”又余咒教，宣说非一。

Such texts also state that on frequent occasions of entering mandalas of highest yoga tantra, you must take both the shared and the unshared tantric vows. 

◎ 众多趣入无上瑜伽曼陀罗时，亦多说须受共不共二种律仪。

The former are simply the vows of a bodhisattva, and taking the vows means promising to apply yourself to the trainings of a bodhisattva, such as the three forms of ethical discipline. 

共者即是菩萨律仪，受律仪者，即就是受学三聚戒等菩萨学处。

Therefore, the perfection vehicle has no path other than the trainings that accord with your promise to practice the bodhisattva deeds after developing the spirit of enlightenment. (Moreover, the above qualm is most unreasonable because you must promise to uphold all aspects of the teaching when you take the tantric vow. ) 

除发心已如其誓受学所学处而修学外，虽于波罗蜜多乘中，亦无余道故。

This is in accordance with what is said in the Diamond Dāka Tantra, Integration Tantra, and Vajra Climax Tantra on the occasion of taking the pledges of Amitābha: Uphold all of the excellent teachings: The three vehicles, the external, and the secret. 

又《金刚空行》及《三补止》，《金刚顶》中，受阿弥陀三昧耶时，悉作是云：“无余受外密，三乘正妙法。”

Some see a slight discrepancy in terms of what you are and are not to do and conclude that these are in complete contradiction, like hot and cold. 

由见此等少有开遮不同之分，即执一切，犹如寒热遍相违者，是显自智极粗浅耳。

Obviously, this is a cursory assessment. Apart from certain points about what is or is not to be done, the scriptures are very much in agreement. Therefore, upon entering the higher levels of the three vehicles or the five paths, for instance, you must have all the good qualities of the lower vehicles and paths.

◎ 如是唯除少分别缘开遮之外，诸正至言，极随顺故。若趣上上三乘五道，必须完具下下乘道功德种类。
