Introduction to Tuole Temple

**His Holiness Ramo Yongzin**

Dharma Master Yongzeng, named Ramo Yongzin Lobsang Kezhi Gyatso (1908-2004), entered Buddhism at the age of six, and went to Labrang Monastery, a famous Buddhist temple, at the age of seventeen, with XX as his root guru. He studied with more than a dozen masters, including Dharma Master Sangke Tankai and Dharma Master Gongtang Luozhe of this monastery.

Because Dharma Master Yongzeng often practiced the Three Ways, he was called the wishful treasure of empowerment, follow-up empowerment, lineage holder of scriptures and teachings, secrets and rituals by Tibetan Buddhist circles.

Dharma Master Yongzeng, with a heart of compassion, worked tirelessly, taught profound Dharma in various places throughout his life, saved countless sentient beings, and passed away at the age of ninety-seven.

After Vajra Master Ngawang Gyatso became a follower of this master in 1980, he constantly received many sutras and teachings.

From 1993 to 2004, the master has come to study with His Holiness Master Yongzeng every spring, summer and autumn for 11 consecutive years, and has completely obtained His Holiness's deep empowerments, the inheritance of scriptures, secrets and rituals.

**Introduction to Vajra Master Ngawang Gyatso**

Master Ngawang Gyatso was born on March 3, 1969 (the fifteenth day of the first lunar month) in Hainan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Qinghai Province.

The master began to practice Buddhism as a novice monk at the age of six, and became an ordained monk at the age of eighteen. He had studied with Dharma Master Lamaoyong Zeng, Geshe Rinpoche, Lobsang Dorje Vajra Guru, Gejia Rinpoche, Dharma Master Yeshe Gyatso, and Gazang Qusong Vajra Guru and the 10th Panchen Lama.

The master is like a teacher, and he has completely obtained the inheritance of the seven masters' hearts and methods, obtained more than 200 kinds of empowerment, more than 300 kinds of empowerment with Xu, more than 280 kinds of guidance, more than 500 scriptures and more than 80 kinds of transmissions and pith instructions.

The master followed Lamaoyong to increase the Dharma Master for more than 20 years and gained the experience of the Dharma Master throughout his life.

Lamaoyong enlarged the Dharma Master before expressing his silence and instructed the master: **"Your whole career in this life is to turn the wheel of Dharma widely and spread the Dharma for the benefit of all living beings."**

Master Ah Wang studied at Qinghai Buddhist Academy and Taer Monastery Debating School.

During Master Ngawang Gyatso's studies, he completed the five major treatises, the second and second esoteric courses of the five great vajras with extraordinary diligence and wisdom, and mastered all the contents.

Since graduating from Qinghai Buddhist Academy and Ta'er Monastery Debating Academy with excellent grades, the master has been living in Qinghai Tuole Monastery, serving as the Vajra Guru and the presiding officer of the monastery. He taught the monks of Tuole Monastery every day in groups of five great treatises, three ways of Dharmaism, and four tantras, and set up a new sutra debate school in the monastery.

Master Ah Wang has now produced several batches of lamas with a Geshe degree (equivalent to a Ph.D.) in Buddhism.

The master also insists on going into retreat for two months every year.

Master Ah Wang often gives sermons, teachings, precepts, and empowerment ceremonies in both Tibetan and Chinese areas, and often holds patriotic teachings, and patriotic activities in monasteries, making due contributions to the promotion of social harmony and stable development.

At the invitation of believers from other places, the master has traveled all over the world to teach the sutras and dharmas to those who are destined to hear them.

The guru is always compassionate and easily approachable, and speaks according to the occasion, and preaches the basic theories and simple practices of Buddhism, such as the Three Paths of Dharma, the Four Refuges, the Seven Branches of Offering, the Dharma of Amitabha Buddha, the Vajrasattva Ritual, and the [Heart Sutra](/english/heartsutranotes) of Prajna Paramita.

The master has tens of thousands of disciples of many different nationalities.

The master's writings include Commentary on Philosophy, Commentary on the Vajra Prajna Paramita Sutra, Dictation from the Three Masters of the Three Paths and Three Schools, Vajrasattva Ritual and Practice, and Dakini Buddha's Mother Ritual. Tracks and Practical Practices, Practice of Retreat, Simmering Sang Ritual, Biography of Vajra Guru Gazang Qusong, History of Tibetan Buddhism, Dabao Motto, Nectar Dharma Rain, Tantric Buddhism Feng Shui and the "Dharma Ocean Treasures" series, etc.

The master's writings are concise and comprehensive, and the analysis is profound and thorough, and has been praised and acclaimed by many great scholars in Buddhist circles at home and abroad.

In recent years, believers from all over the world have made donations to Tuole Temple.

Since March 2006, in order to meet the needs of an increasing number of monks and laypeople to hear the Dharma, the master has continued to expand the infrastructure of Tuole Monastery, and presided over the construction of the Daxiong Hall, the Great Lecture Hall, the Upper and Lower Debating Courts, the Tibetan Sutra Pavilion, the residence of the Sangha, the eight stupas, the Dharma Protector Hall and other buildings.

In 2012, the Awa Temple was rebuilt at the request of Tibetan believers.

Today, in the pure land on earth at Tuole Monastery, the master gives the most profound Dharma teachings to devotees in the ten directions with the greatest diligence.

#### Characteristics of Buddhism

Buddhism has six characteristics: 

Harmonious Co-existence, 

Liberation, 

Cause and Effect, 

Cessation of Afflictions, 

Logic, 

and knowledge of the Ultimate.

**1. Harmonious Co-existence**

There have been countless wars in human history, and there have been many wars caused by religious disputes, but there has been no war caused by Buddhism.

The compassion of Buddhism brings harmonious coexistence to human beings.

**2. Liberation**

Ordinary religions may promise that practitioners can go to heaven in their teachings, but they do not talk about complete liberation.

Buddhist practitioners can achieve liberation through practice.

The method of liberation from birth, old age, sickness and death is only available in Buddhism, not in any other religion.

**3. Cause and effect**

The teachings of most religions hold that the universe and everything that is characteristic of Buddhism was created by one Lord.

Buddhism teaches the theory of cause and effect, that is, whatever kind of cause you create, that kind of effect will be produced in return.

Good is rewarded with good, evil is rewarded with evil, and both suffering and happiness are the results of good and evil karma.

There is no savior, one's own destiny should be changed by oneself.

Stop worrying.

General religions advocate the good and the evil, but the methods for dealing with afflictions are incomplete.

**4. End of Suffering**

Learning Buddhism can bring an end to any troubles you may have.

**5. Use of Logic and Reasoning**

Other religions only talk about faith and not about logic, while Buddhism talks about logic and truth.

The Buddha said: Bhikkhus or wise people should contemplate my words well, like refining, cutting and grinding gold.

**6. The Ultimate**

Any religion can use reasoning to some degree, but not through to the end. Buddhism is a knowledge of the ultimate, which is the biggest difference between Buddhism and other religions. The truth of what the Buddha said can help reach liberation.

The basic laws of all things in the universe, the origin of life, and the incredible phenomena of cultural development can be traced back to the source, including social phenomena that cannot be explained by modern science, but which are clearly expressed in Buddhist scriptures.

In practical terms, the ultimate liberation, the ultimate emptiness, the ultimate cause and effect, and the ultimate perfection all fully demonstrate that Buddhism is a science that can achieve ultimate perfection through practice and enlightenment.

#### Characteristics of Tibetan Buddhism

Tibetan Buddhism has five characteristics: 

Complete teaching

Unbroken lineage

Complete practice

Complete preservation

Complete training curriculum

**1. Teaching is complete**

Buddha's teachings are divided into Theravada / Hinayana and Mahayana. Mahayana has both the sutra method and the tantra methods. Now there are three major schools of Buddhism, referring to Southern Buddhism, Chinese Buddhism and Tibetan Buddhism. Southern Buddhism is the method of Theravada, it does not have the method of Mahayana. Chinese Buddhism is still dominated by  Mahayana Buddhism, but it does not have the four continuations of Tantric Buddhism. The teachings of Tibetan Buddhism include the Theravada method, the Mahayana Sutra method, and the Vajrayana Tantra method of perfection.

**2. The lineage is complete**

Except for the sutras, most of the traditions of Southern Buddhism and Chinese Buddhism have been cut off. However, the inheritance of the precepts, oral transmissions, guidance, empowerments, etc. of Tibetan Buddhism have not been broken, and the lineage is pure and complete.

**3. The practice is complete**

Southern Buddhism cultivates the precepts for liberation and the thirty-seven paths. Chinese Buddhism cultivates the precepts of separation and liberation, the precepts of Bodhisattva, compassion, bodhicitta, and six degrees of perfection. Tibetan Buddhist practice is complete: the external practice of the Hinayana method, the internal practice of the Mahayana Sutra method and the Tantric practice of the four tantras, and the practice of the three vehicles of special liberation vows, Bodhisattva vows and Tantric vows.

**4. Well preserved**

When Buddhism spread to Southeast Asian countries, all countries integrated their own local culture into Buddhism, and Buddhism was more or less influenced by local culture. When Buddhism entered China, Taoism and Confucian culture were highly developed, so Han culture influenced Buddhism, and Buddhism there became Han-style Buddhism. When Buddhism was introduced to Tibetan areas, there was no special culture formed in Tibet, so Tibetan culture evolved on the basis of mature Buddhism. Likewise, the Tibetan language is also formed on the basis of Sanskrit. Therefore, Tibetan Buddhism has preserved the original teachings of the Buddha of more than 2,500 years ago.

**5. The course is complete**

The courses of Buddhist study include sutras, tantras, and treatises. The small method and the sutra method taught by the Buddha himself are called sutras. The tantra method taught by the Buddha is called continuation.

The explanations of the scriptures and tantras preached by the Buddhas, by Bodhisattvas and Mahasiddhas are called sutras. There are many Buddhists who study the scriptures directly in Southern and Chinese Buddhism.

Tibetan Buddhism generally studies the sutras first, and then the tantras, because the content of the tantras is very deep and broad, it is easier to understand the content of the tantras having studied the sutras first.

Tibetan Buddhism mainly studies the Five Great Treatises, "The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path to Enlightenment", "The Esoteric Essays on the Stages of Tantric Buddhism" and so on. A treatise contains references to a lot of sutras, and if you study a treatise well, you will also become familiar with a lot of sutras. Therefore, Tibetan Buddhism first studies the theories, then the scriptures, and then the continuations (the tantras).

Tibetan Buddhism has the five perfections, pure lineage, and the complete sequence. At the same time, it integrates the essence of 84,000 methods, so it can cure the 84,000 kinds of troubles of modern people, and it is very suitable for contemporary lay people to practice.

#### Explanation of the practice steps of the Tuo Le Community Practice Center

Please arouse Bodhicitta and listen carefully!

Now I will talk about the sequence of practice in the Tuo Le Center, which is also the order for success in the practice of laypeople.

If you want to learn Buddhism and practice, you need a sequence, and a sequence can be completed. The sequence is very important.

Without orderly cultivation, you can only accumulate a little blessing, eliminate a little karma. You will not achieve success, you will not cut off your afflictions, you will not attain renunciation, and you will not gain bodhicitta.

If you follow the ordered stages of practice, no matter whether you are a lay person or a monk, you will be successful.

In the history of Tibetan Buddhism in the past, there were many examples of the achievement of enlightenment in one lifetime by lay people. For example, the master of the Kadampa school, Zhongdunpa, became a Buddha in his own lifetime. 

The master of the Kagyu school, Milarepa, was also a layperson and became a Buddha in his own lifetime.

Master Marpa, the great siddha of the Kagyu sect, also practiced as a householder. 

Among the five Sakya Patriarchs, except for two who were monks, the other three practiced as laypeople.

So laypeople and householders can also be successful.

But now many laypeople feel that we have no hope of achieving success in our practice at home, we just recite the Buddha's words, get a little blessing, and eliminate some karma.

The idea is wrong, don't be so pessimistic.

All disciples who practice at home can achieve success, and even become Buddhas.

Everyone should know the concept of achievement. If you have attained renunciation, it will be considered an achievement; if you have attained bodhicitta, it will be considered an achievement. Anyone who has attained the right path, such as the five paths of Buddhism, the path of accumulation, the path of practice, the path of vision, the path of cultivation without learning the Dharma, as long as one obtains one of the Dharmas, it can be said to be an achievement.

In fact, among lay disciples, there are many, many people who become Buddhas in this current  lifetime. It can be seen that lay disciples can also achieve liberation.

But to achieve it, you need to practice the steps.

Without work, there will be no success.

For example, to build a ten thousand zhang tall building, it must be built on one or two floors.

It is impossible to build a building if it is not built in the order of first floor first, and second floor second, so the order is very important.

But some people ask: Isn't it said that there are people who achieve instant enlightenment and become Buddhas right now? There are such people, but who is this kind of person? It refers to their achievements through practice in a previous life.

For example, if you have attained the path of resources in your previous life, you don’t need to practice the path of resources in this life, and you start from the path of additional practice. This kind of disciple can achieve enlightenment now.

The vast majority (at least 99%) of lay disciples today are not this kind of disciple.

Ordinary people among ordinary people must take it step by step, and don’t think about achieving success or enlightenment all at once, there is no such possibility.

But one step at a time, it will surely come.

For example, when climbing a mountain, you must climb step by step! 

This is the truth, everyone must understand.

The practice order of the Tuo Le Center is the order in which the disciples practice in their lifetimes.

It is divided into five classes: 

the first class is the Preparatory class, 

the second class is the Main class, 

the third class is the wisdom stage, 

the fourth class is the generation stage, 

and the fifth class is the completion stage.

**The first stage is Preparatory.**

Preparatory classes are mainly based on reciting scriptures.

The Heart Sutra of Prajna Paramita is the quintessence of 84,000 dharmas and must be memorized.


The practice sequence of the Tuo Le Co-cultivation Center explains that "Reciting Sutras" is the essence of the five major treatises, and must be memorized.

The Guru Longevity Prayer is very important.

If you have a strong belief in your guru, you can get great blessings; if your beliefs are small, you will get small blessings; if you don’t have any beliefs, you can’t get any blessings.

Therefore, as the previous masters said, if the power of belief is great, then the power of blessing is great; the stronger the belief, the greater the blessing; if the power of belief is small, the power of blessing is small; if there is no belief, there is no blessing.

Therefore, the "Longevity Prayer for the Guru" must be memorized.

"Guru Yoga" is the foundation of becoming a Buddha, and it must be memorized.

"Song of the Way of Victory" is about how to achieve step-by-step cultivation, and it must be memorized.

"The Three Main Paths" is about the three main paths of renunciation, bodhicitta, and emptiness, which must be memorized.

There are more than ten chapters in "Song of the Stages of the Bodhi Path", which condensed the essence of the two major treatises, "The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path to Enlightenment" and "The Brief Treatise on the Stages of the Path to Enlightenment".

Memorizing the merits and virtues of "The Poetry of the Bodhi Path" is equivalent to memorizing the merits of the "The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path to Enlightenment" and "The Brief Treatise on the Stages of the Path to Enlightenment".

"Auspicious Hymn of the Eight Saints" should also be memorized.

In the "Thirty-five Buddhas of Repentance", each of us has a lot of karma, so we should repent and make amends every day.

Repentance, the most outstanding method in the dharma door of Xianzong is the "Thirty-five Buddhas of Repentance", which must be memorized.

"Golden Brightness Most Victorious King Jing Confession" and "Minimal Confession" have only one chapter each, and it is very easy to memorize them.

"The Seven Branches of Offering", "Mandala Offering Text", "Psalmist's Prayer and Vows", "Gelugpa Teaching Prosperity Vows", these have already been discussed, and they all have to be memorized.

In addition to reciting the above, the preparatory class will also recite the following.

First, recite the Heart Sutra 10,000 times.

Everyone should recite it 10,000 times on their own.

If you can't recite it 10,000 times each, that's fine. You can recite it in a group, and you can finish 10,000 times in no time.


If one hundred people recite together the "Heart Sutra" once, it counts as one hundred times, that is, as if everyone had recited one hundred times.

If a hundred people recite it ten times together, it counts as a thousand times, that is, everyone recites it a thousand times.

If a hundred people recite it a hundred times together, it counts as 10,000 times, that is, everyone has recited it 10,000 times.

Therefore, if we practice together in a group, we will quickly complete the Heart Sutra 10,000 times.

After reciting the Heart Sutra 10,000 times, many obstacles will be removed.

Those of us who are just beginning to practice, start by reciting the Heart Sutra.

The more you recite the Heart Sutra, the more obstacles will be removed, and the path of cultivation will be smooth and flowing. This is the first requirement of cultivation, and it cannot be skipped.

After reciting the Heart Sutra 10,000 times, we began to practice the Four Preliminaries.

First, recite "Four Refuges" 100,000 to 1,000,000 times.

100,000 times is the minimum number, and it is best to recite it 400,000 times, or a million times.

It does not take long to recite one hundred thousand or even one million times in the course of daily practice.

For example, twenty people recite the four refuges together: 

Namo Gurubai, Namo Boudaya, Namo Damaya, and Namo Sangaya. 

To the Guru for Refuge I go.

To the Buddha for Refuge I go.

To the teachings for Refuge I go.

To the spiritual community for Refuge I go.

One cycle is equal to twenty cycles, and five cycles are equal to one hundred cycles. 

In this way, the practice of reciting the "Four Refuges" together can not only be completed quickly, but also can be blessed by the Guru's Three Jewels.


Guru Yoga at least 100,000 times.

We must recite our Gelugpa Guru Yoga, that is, the prayer of Master Tsongkhapa: 

----
Objectless compassion, Chenrezig,

Lord of stainless wisdom, Manjushri,

Conquering mara’s horders, Vajrapani,

Crown jewel of the Sages of the Land of Snows, Tsongkhapa,

Losang Drakpa, at your feet, I pray.

----

Offer the mandala at least 100,000 times.

There are thirty-seven mantras and seven mantras in the mandala, and the seven mantras are to be offered here  100,000 times.

Everyone will understand the video about Mandala.

Vajrasattva 100,000 times is a hundred-syllable mantra 100,000 times.

A hundred-syllable mantra one hundred thousand times can eliminate the karma of body, speech and mind.

The order of the above four additional lines must be followed. If you can do it in this order, the path of practice will be safe and sound.

Reciting the Four Refuge 100,000 times helps to obtain the blessing of the Guru and the Three Jewels; reciting the Guru Yoga 100,000 times brings the special blessing of the Guru, and the blessing of the Guru Three Jewels can change our body, speech and mind; Good fortune will increase greatly. Then, if you practice the Vajrasattva Hundred-syllable Mantra, you will be safe and sound.

Some people don't know that they can directly recite Vajrasattva in the order of offering Mandala first and then reciting Vajrasattva. Due to the Buddha's blessing of Vajrasattva, all the karmic obstacles of life are forced out. Or a little thing happened around us, and we can't stand it.

If the mandala is offered first, the blessing will increase.

When the karma is too great, the karma cannot be forced out, it can only be eliminated.

For example, reciting the hundred-syllable mantra may bring out small pains, but small pains can eliminate big karmic obstacles such as going to hell, and small pains can eliminate big disasters.

So, order is important.

The relationship between cause and effect is very complicated. Good and evil karma encounters conditions.

Goodness is not necessarily all good, and evil is not necessarily all evil.

Good has its share of evil, and evil has its share of good.

For example, good intentions can lead to bad things, but bad intentions can result in good things.

But the cause of good retribution must be good, and the cause of evil retribution must be evil, so it is said that good actions have good retribution, and evil actions bring evil retribution.

Everyone should know this.

This is very important.

And then prepare to study.

First learn four plus lines.

The study of the preparatory class is mainly based on watching videos and reading the Treasures of the Dharma Ocean books.

We now have videos on the Four Refuges. When studying the Four Refuges, we should watch the videos of the Four Refuges and read the material on the Four Refuges in the Treasures of the Dharma Ocean.

If there is a master in charge of Tuole Temple in each center, students will watch the video with the master to study.

The other contents of Sijiaxing are also learned by watching videos and legal texts.

When offering Mantra, those who have not offered Mantra before should study the video for Mantra in advance. After all Mantra's meaning is understood, repair Mantra.

To study "Chanting Sutras", also watch the video and the relevant content in "Treasures of the Dharma Ocean".

Learn Sanshidao again.

There are two kinds of Sanshidao CDs, one is Sanshidao taught in Hong Kong, and the other is Sanshidao taught in Lishui, Zhejiang.

Look at both, because there is a little difference between the two.

It is very important to watch the video of Sanshidao and the related content of Sanshidao in Treasure of the Sea of ​​Fa.

After reading the video of Sanshidao and the related Dharma texts, you will know how to practice, how to achieve, and how to follow the path of practice.

This is very important.

All study content is to help learn through the above methods.

Memorize and recite the scriptures according to the above requirements, and when you have completed your studies, you can graduate after taking extra classes.

If everyone works hard, I believe that preparatory classes will soon graduate.

After graduating from the preparatory class, they will enter the main class, and other new disciples can enter the preparatory class.

Each group practice center will start the group practice once a week, and it will increase to two or three times later.

At present, there is only one preparatory class, and other classes will be gradually added in the future. When there are all five classes, then the co-cultivation center will have co-cultivation learning every day, which is very good!

The second class is the Main class.

The Miain class will first recite the following:

Recite the Twenty-One Tara Sutra 10,000 times, and it is even better if you can recite it 100,000 times.

Why should we recite the Twenty-One Tara Sutra? The 21 Tara Prayer Sutra has twenty-one different functions: the effect of eliminating disasters, the effect of health, the effect of longevity, the effect of exorcising demons, the effect of obtaining wealth, the effect of removing obstacles, and so on.

These functions and merits are very, very helpful to our achievement, so we should recite the "21 Tara Prayer Sutra".

If the practice is done in sequence, the mantra will be transferred after the offering, and the "Twenty-One Tara Prayer Sutra" will be recited smoothly.

Recite the "Medicine Buddha Ritual" 14,000 times, and you can recite it in a group practice.

It has the merits of health, longevity, elimination of disasters, avoidance of calamities, and wish-fulfilment.

Reciting the six-syllable mantra 100,000 times is of great help in cultivating compassion.

Reciting the mantra of Vajra Hand Bodhisattva 100,000 times can increase your abilities.

Reciting the Manjushri mantra 100,000 times can unlock wisdom.

Recite the White God of Wealth Heart Mantra 100,000 times to gain wealth.


#### Explanation of the practice steps of the Tuo Le collective practice center

Reciting the Vajra Heart Mantra one hundred thousand times can ward off evil spirits.

Reciting the mantra of the Buddha's Mother of Light a hundred thousand times can expel evil friends.

If you recite the Ruyi Guanyin mantra a million times, you can get your wish.

This is what the Main class recites.

Although 100,000 times and 1,000,000 times may seem like a lot, they are very fast when they practice together. One hundred thousand times can be completed quickly in two or three times.

Next, recite the following contents: 

"In Praise of Dependent Origination"

[In Praise of Dependent Origination](https://studybuddhism.com/en/tibetan-buddhism/original-texts/sutra-texts/in-praise-of-dependent-arising)

"Prayer for Good"

"Speech Blessing Mantra".

Then you need to study the following contents: 

Study the "Medicine Buddha Sutra", 

"Medicine Buddha Ritual", 

"Twenty-One Tara Prayer Sutra", 

"Tantric Buddhism" (omitted).

There are two kinds of "The Essays on the Order of the Esoteric Buddhism", the broad and the abbreviated.

When we start to study the four tantras of tantra, we will understand what tantra is.


The third class is the Prajna class.

The Prajna class studies the Dharma of the Xian sect, and it should have been in the front of the main class.

Why put the Prajna class in the third position?

It is because our karma is very heavy and our troubles are great.

Reciting the mantra of the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas during the main class can eliminate our karma, especially big karma, and brings the blessings of the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas.

Then enter the prajna class to practice prajna, and you can learn the wisdom of prajna, which is the wisdom of emptiness.

If you don't get the blessings of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas, and your karmic obstacles have not been eliminated to a certain level, no matter how clearly the master talks about emptiness, it will be difficult for you to understand fully. This is a secret sequence.

The original order is that the Prajna class comes first, and the main class follows.

The main class is placed in the front, and then enters the prajna class to cultivate insight. This is the secret sequence.

Ordinary masters don't understand this secret sequence, and everyone should understand it.

The Prajna class should recite the "Diamond Sutra" a thousand times, recite the Prajna Shrine a thousand times, and recite the Manjusri True Name Sutra a thousand times.

The above recitations can also be practiced together.

The Prajna class should recite the Outline of the Three Ways.

"The Outline of San Shi Dao" only has than ten chapters, so it is not difficult to memorize.

Prajna class should study: 

"The Path of Peace and Happiness"

"Diamond Sutra"

"Extensive Treatise on the Steps of the Bodhi Path"

"A Brief Treatise on the Steps of the Bodhi Path".

If you start studying the Diamond Sutra from here, you will understand a little bit about the emptiness of the Diamond Sutra.

The Extensive Treatise on the Stages of the Path to Bodhi should be recited at least five times.

The fourth class is the stage of generation.

In the generation stage, the recitations are:

the Mahavira Vajra ritual 10,000 times, 

or the Dakini Buddha ritual 10,000 times, 

or the Hayagriva ritual 10,000 times.

Start visualising the deity from here.

There are often disciples who have just begun to study Buddhism and say, "Master, I want to cultivate the deity." Obviously, they have not yet reached that level.

From here, you can choose the deity, and the disciples of our Tuole Group choose three deities: Mahavira, Dakini Buddha and Hayagriva.

Among these three deities, if you think you are suitable for practicing Mahavira, choose Mahavira; if you feel that you are related to Dakini Buddha, you can choose Dakini; if you feel that you are related to Hayagriva, you Just choose Hayagriva, **the best thing is to choose the Mahavira deity.**

Deities such as Kalachakra are very long and difficult to recite, so ordinary lay people find it hard to practice them.

The rituals of Mahavira Vajra and the rituals of the Dakini Buddha can be recited and practiced by laypeople.

This is the deity that I have chosen for you here.

The generation stage class is to learn the second stage of tantra and the stages of the tantra path.

That is to say, from here, the real learning of the tantra path and the tantra birth sequence in the second tantra.

The birth stage class is to practice the Three Body Dharma Door.

The Three Body Dharma Door is the Dharmakāya Dharma Door, the Sambhogakaya Dharma Door, and the Nirmāṇakāya Dharma Door.

The three bodies of the Buddha are the Dharmakāya (ultimate reality), the Saṃbhogakāya (divine incarnation of Buddha), and the Nirmāṇakāya (physical incarnation of Buddha).

Just cultivate the Three Body Method.

When you practice the Three Body Method, you will know that you are different and can truly be liberated from the cycle of birth and death.

**The fifth class is the completion class.**

The completion class should recite the Mahavira mantra 10 million times or the Dakini Buddha's mantra 10 million times or the Hayagriva mantra 10 million times.


If the deity of Mahavira is chosen, the mantra of Mahavira should be recited ten million times; if the deity of Dakini Buddha is chosen, the mantra of Dakini should be recited ten million times; should Hayagriva be chosen. The deity of Hayagriva, the mantra of Hayagriva should be recited ten million times.

In terms of learning, when it comes to the completion stage, you must learn the Tantric completion stage and the method of Xi Zenghuai Punishment.

In terms of practice, when it comes to the completion stage, there is no need to recite the rituals, just recite the mantra, and then it is really time to cultivate the clear points of the Qi meridians.

By cultivating the qi meridian, the qi meridians in the whole body will be opened, and the qi will enter the central meridian, which is really different.

Then, cultivate the kundalini fire, cultivate the non-dual nature of emptiness and great happiness, and finally cultivate the five perfections.

The generation stage and the completion stage are the two most essential stages of the supreme yoga in the four tantras.

To become a Buddha, you must practice these two stages.

Our stage is an ordinary layman's stage of becoming a Buddha.

According to this sequence of practice, if the karmic conditions are sufficient, some people may become Buddhas in one lifetime, some people will be liberated from the cycle of birth and death in their lifetime, and some people will be reborn in the Pure Land by cultivating dakini. Rebirth in a pure land.

For example, among the masters of the lineage of the Dakini Buddha, there are seven teachers and students of Nasa Zhipupa who led them to be reborn in the Pure Land of Dakinis.

Bringing one's body to rebirth in the Pure Land is a unique method of Tantric Buddhism.

It is very, very important that it can be accomplished just by practicing in the order given above.

If one class can finish reading, reciting, and studying the scriptures in two years, five classes can complete the entire course of practice in ten years.

Ten years later, you will be able to practice independently, recite sutras, go into retreat, etc.

If you work hard, you will be successful in your life.

The order of practice and the methods learned by lay people are different from those of monks.

Monks have time and they can study a lot, and they can even study the five major treatises completely without missing a single bit. It is different for laypeople, who don’t have so much time to study, and only learn the most essential methods.

For example, what Venerable Milarepa learned is the most essential method.

Once the study stage is completed, and through careful practice, one will truly become a Buddha in one lifetime.

The success of the layperson is like this.

The practice steps of the Tuo Le Center are complete. I hope everyone can practice according to these steps.

**Practice requires sequential steps.**

Please arouse Bodhicitta and listen carefully!

What I'm going to talk about today is the order of practice.

If there is no sequence in practice, there can be no achievement.

If there is an order to the practice, first, it can eliminate the unlawful conditions of practice. On the way to become a Buddha, there are a few obstacles, peace and good health.

Second, you can accumulate good fortune, eliminate karma and even achieve success.

Without order, chaotic cultivation and blind cultivation can also accumulate blessings and eliminate karmic obstacles, but there will be no achievement.

Because there will be many obstacles in the process of practice, it is important to understand that practice requires correct sequencing.

According to Master Tsongkhapa's "Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path of Bodhi" or "A Brief Treatise on the Stages of the Path of Bodhi", first practice the lower sage path, then the middle sage path, then the upper sage path, and then enter the second stage of Tantric Buddhism, and then Becoming a Buddha is such a sequence.

In our simplest terms, the order is twofold: first, to cultivate perfection in the world; second, to cultivate transcendence of the world.

These are two processes and two times.

The first step is to cultivate the perfection of the world.

What is meant by perfection in the world? It is the pursuit of the clergy and the seven virtues of humans and gods.

The seven virtues of man and nature are: a healthy life, a long life, a wealthy life, a solemn life, a persuasive life, a wise life, and a loving life.

If you cultivate such a perfect life in the world, the accumulation of good fortune will be quick.

You can call on many people to chant Buddha's prayers and accumulate blessings in one sentence, so that you can accumulate blessings quickly.

That is to say, being able to cultivate the seven virtues of human beings and heaven means accumulating blessings, eliminating karmic obstacles, and achieving quick achievements.

From our perspective as Buddhists, the Panchen Lama of the past dynasties is a life with the seven virtues of man and nature.

There are many other masters who also possess the seven virtues of humanity and heaven.

This is important.

**Learning Buddhism requires a healthy body.**

A healthy life is very important. Many people say that you don't care about your body when you study Buddhism. This statement is wrong.

**Learning Buddhism requires longevity.**

The longer your lifespan, the more time you have to practice. The longer the practice, the greater the possibility of achievement, and the greater the possibility of becoming a Buddha.

**Learning Buddhism requires wealth.**

At the beginning of learning Buddhism, one needs to cultivate the perfection of the world, so wealth is needed.

Some people will have some misunderstandings. Isn't studying Buddhism to see through and let go? It is to see through and let go, but on the understanding level of seeing through and letting go, there are two meanings. One of them means letting go of troubles. It does not tell you to let go of wealth, family, family life and so on.

To ask you to let go is to let go of your troubles, everyone should know this.

Do we need wealth to study Buddhism? Wealth is needed in the beginning.

At the beginning we do not have open wisdom, we do not have the power to meditate, but we have wealth that we could use to accumulate blessings.

Using wealth to build a Buddha statue can accumulate great blessings! Using wealth to support a center can accumulate great blessings! Therefore, we still need wealth to study Buddhism.

Tantra and Sutra are still a little different. Tantric practice is joyful cultivation, and Sutra practice is penance. Therefore, Tantra does not exclude you from having wealth.

The secret method talks about the five natures of the God of Wealth: The White God of Wealth, the Yellow God of Wealth, the Red God of Wealth, the Black God of Wealth, and the Green God of Wealth are required in order to practice.

Why talk about so many gods of wealth? We cultivators need wealth, so the Buddha also talked about these Gods of Wealth and the Dharma Doors of these Gods of Wealth.

**To study Buddhism requires a solemn appearance.**

If you reach the point of transcending the world, it doesn't matter whether your appearance is dignified or not, but when you start to cultivate perfection in the world, a dignified appearance is still necessary.

Therefore, the Medicine Buddha made twelve vows, one of which was: The appearance of all beings and mine is the same, and the appearance of all beings becomes as dignified as mine.

Here, an example is given to illustrate that dignified appearance is required for the cultivation of worldly perfection.

Once Venerable Atisha came to the Tibetan area, and many great masters in the Tibetan area went to greet Venerable Atisha. One of them, Keton, had a very dignified appearance.

One morning, he went to a family's house for alms.

At that time, a woman in her twenties was milking a yak in the yard. The mage threw the tin stick in his hand to the ground, and the yak was so frightened that it suddenly ran away and kicked the milk to the ground.

The woman was very angry, so she took a handful of ashes and wanted to spread the ashes on the monk's face to vent her anger.

But when she came to the monk, she saw that he was a very dignified master, so she didn't scatter the ashes and said, "Master, please come to the house for dinner!" This is the effect of a dignified appearance.

Particularly when saving sentient beings, it is especially necessary to have a dignified appearance.

When the disciples see a dignified Master, it is easy for them to have confidence and respect.

If the master has a bad appearance, such as scars on the mouth, slanted eyes, crooked nose, etc., although the practice is very good, ordinary people will have obstacles in their hearts because of this, and it is difficult to have a respectful heart. Therefore, in order to cultivate the perfection of the world, it is necessary to have a dignified appearance.

To cultivate a dignified appearance, one should recite the holy names of the Eight Tathagatas of the Medicine Buddha as often as possible.

With a dignified appearance, people will feel very comfortable when they see you.

But understand that being dignified doesn't necessarily mean just being pretty.

**Learning Buddhism requires persuasion.**

That is to say, the words have to be persuasive. Just being persuasive is not the same.

**Learning Buddhism requires wisdom.**

A wise life is very important. Wisdom can eliminate pain and eliminate worries.

**Finally, learning Buddhism requires freedom and love.**

It is freedom and the power to love others.

There are three kinds of results of good and evil karma: present, coming, and to come.

The result of great good and bad karma or long-term good and bad karma is present; the result of medium good and bad karma is coming; the result of small good and evil karma is future.

The great blessings and the results of long-term blessings will be manifested in this life and this life, so perfection in the world can be achieved through cultivation.

Many of us who have just learned Buddhism and have just entered Buddhism have misunderstandings to varying degrees.

Misunderstood what? It's just that some people think that once you enter Buddhism, you are a monk, and you don't need a family.

For example, there is a donor I have known for several years, and I said you should take refuge.

He said, "Master, no, I still have a wife and children. When they are able to stand on their own, I will take refuge in you."

A misunderstanding, a huge misunderstanding, cultivation is not like this.

In addition, many people say, what do you need wealth for after you learn Buddhism? Transfer the wealth to me, or donate it to society.

This is also not right. Learning Buddhism still requires wealth.

There are many such misunderstandings in studying Buddhism in China, which we must avoid.

At the beginning of learning Buddhism, the body is indeed very important.

Buddha Shakyamuni taught prostration in the tantras, but there was no prostration in the Chan sect.

Prostration not only accumulates blessings, but also eliminates karma, and also exercises the body.

When Buddha Shakyamuni asked us to cultivate the Eight Tathagatas of the Medicine Buddha, he told us that a healthy body is very important.

Many people have such a misunderstanding. Now that they have studied Buddhism, the body is not important. The most important thing is the Three Jewels.

The Three Jewels are important, but so is the body.

The body is a ship that sails through the sea of ​​suffering, and the body cannot be damaged.

In addition, longevity is also very important, so Buddha Shakyamuni talked about the Buddha of Longevity and the Dharma Door of Longevity.

---

The Second Stage is to practice transcending the world.

When I first started to study Buddhism, I cultivated perfection in the world. When the practice in the world is more perfect and fulfilled, I will naturally not be interested in the worldly law. When we reach this stage, the time to transcend the world will come.

At this time, seeing through and letting go is letting go of wealth, family, and attachment to small families and thinking that all sentient beings in the six realms are your own parents and relatives, letting go of everything that belongs to selfishness, and that you are beyond the world.

Once you transcend the world, it will be completely different, your heart will be opened, and you will be able to accommodate the entire world.

If you can accommodate sentient beings of the six realms in your heart, you will no longer need wealth at this time, you can let go of wealth, and let go of the things you used to be greedy for.

However, the wonderful thing is that when we let go and stop pursuing wealth, wealth will naturally follow us in turn.

Because our hearts are opened, it will be different, and we can say that we have become the masters of the world.

There is room for all sentient beings in the six realms in your heart, if you tell a cockroach to get out, it will get out, and even the cockroach will listen to you.

Beyond that, then you are completely different.

Now we need to cultivate the four immeasurable minds and open our minds. When our minds are truly opened, we don’t need to pursue those things, and what you need will come naturally.

To open your heart, you need to cultivate patience. Now when people scold you, you can't stand it; when people blame you, you can't stand it; even if they don't show you a good face, you can't stand it. 

Having transcended the world, if someone scolds you, you won't feel uncomfortable; if they beat you, you won't feel uncomfortable; if they don't show you a good face, you won't feel uncomfortable, on the contrary, you will feel very happy.

But at this level, no one will do this to you.

For example, Venerable Atisha said that there were only two people in the world who dared to scold him at that time, and those two people were creditors from his past life.

Although Venerable Atisha has achieved success, the two resentful creditors were very, very deeply resentful. Whenever the Venerable Atisha did something they didn't like, they would immediately scold him: this is wrong, and that is not right.

Venerable Atisha said, these two people are my teachers of forbearance, and they are my masters.

So when you reach beyond the world in your practice, you can hardly find anyone who scolds you, and you can't find anyone who blames you. Even if someone really scolds you and blames you, you will be very happy.

Look at those two people who were complaining about Venerable Atisha. Venerable Atisha was also very happy!

Right now, we haven’t transcended the world, and many things that go beyond the world in Buddhism are inappropriate for us people today.

Now we have not yet reached the time to not want wealth, but to use wealth to accumulate blessings and use wealth to support this life.

But when you transcend, you don’t have to support yourself in this life. Beings in the six realms, the gods, dragons, and eight ministries will support you. It’s different!

The stages of practice are the two processes of world perfection and world transcendence mentioned above.

The perfection of the world is the early stage of cultivating liberation, transcending the world is first cultivating liberation, and then one can become a Buddha.

Speech Blessing Mantra

On the tongue of the self-deity deity, the character ah turns into a full moon disk, and the white om () character appears on the moon disk. The om character is surrounded by vowels. The white is arranged clockwise, and there are consonants outside. The mantra is surrounded by the outside, the blue is arranged clockwise, the mantra is radiated and brought back, the guru's three treasures are blessed, the deity protector Arhat, the holy language man, the heavenly blessing, the earth, water, fire, wind, universe, om () ah () hum ( ) and three mantras, white, red, yellow (blue) lights, seven treasures, and eight other mascots, all of which are integrated into the word Om.

Vajrasattva mantra: (seven to one hundred and eight times)

Om Banzaer Sapon Hum (or Hundred Characters Mantra seven times) 

Vowel mantra: (vowel mantra and consonant mantra repeated three times to twenty-one times)

Om ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah

Consonant Mantra:

Gaka Gaga A Sak Swa Sak Sak Sak Cha Cha Cha Chan Nada Tad Tana Bar Pa Wah Maya La Waha Kasa Ha Cha Soha

Dependent Origination Mantra: (Three times to seven times)

Om Yedamahe Dezapawahe Dendikenda Taga Dohayawadedi Kazayoru Daewan Wadi Mahaha Rimana Yesoha

The word Om glows and covers the mantra wheel, the Dependent Origination Mantra melts into the consonant, the consonant merges into the vowel mantra, the vowel merges into the Om character, and it reenters the perfect moon plate. , turn it into a vajra tongue, and even small talk becomes a mantra.

(It can increase the mantra tens of millions of times, the mantra power is not invaded by external forces, the voice can capture thousands of people, and all sounds become mantras.)


Please arouse Bodhicitta and listen carefully!

Speaking of blessings today.

The merit of the Speech Blessing Mantra is very great. Whether the mantra can be achieved or not depends on whether there is a blessing of speech.

After practicing the Speech Blessing Mantra, the mantra will definitely be achieved.

Without the Speech Blessing Mantra, it is very difficult to recite mantras to achieve success.

If you don't have the Speech Blessing Mantrag, when you recite a mantra, there will be a lot of things that block the ability of the mantra.

For example, eating animal tongues will block the ability to chant mantras for a lifetime; eating garlic will block the ability to chant seven-day mantras; eating onions and leeks will block the ability to chant three-day mantras; eating radishes will block the ability to chant mantras for three days. Blocks the ability to chant mantras for a day; there is also a kind of grass, which is called "Zhaji" in Tibetan and "nettle" in Chinese.

Eating this grass also hinders the ability to chant mantras for a lifetime.

Another example: We often accidentally blow with our mouths (blow fire, blow out candles, etc.), which will eliminate the ability to chant a spell a little bit.

If you practice the Speech Blessing Mantra, it will block all these obstacles.

Not only does it help us block out obstacles, but it also increases the merits of our mantras by a million times.

If the Speech Blessing Mantra is cultivated well, gossip will become a mantra.

In the past, Master Reluoyu said: I am not afraid of the five smells, and I am not afraid of onion and garlic, because I have the Speech Blessing Mantra.

There is also Master Ke Zhiqiong Wu Nanjie.

![Ke Zhiqiong](/images/kezhiqiong.png)

Master Qiongwu was a former teacher of the Bonbo Sect in Tibetan areas. He has cultivated the Bonbo teaching method to the highest level. However, he felt that although the Bonbo teaching method can cultivate human beings and heavenly fruit, it cannot cultivate liberation.

He wanted to practice liberation, so he went to India to take refuge in Buddhism and seek Dharma.

In India, he met many great siddhas and went to them to seek Dharma.

He sought many methods, among them the Speech Blessing Mantra.

After Master Qiongwu returned to the Tibetan area, many masters in the Tibetan area came to ask him, "What kind of dharma did you seek in India?" He said proudly, "I went to India to seek a very splendid dharma — Speech Blessing Mantra".

In fact, when he went to India, he obtained hundreds of excellent methods, but he felt that the Speech Blessing Mantra was the most excellent, so he proudly told the masters in Tibetan areas: "I went to India to get the Speech Blessing Mantra method, I recite the mantra and it will definitely work.

You haven't acquired this Dharma yet, so you may not be able to achieve it by reciting mantras. "

Everyone knows that Master Qiongwu has achieved very high achievements in his life. Six-armed Mahakala often follows him like his shadow and serves him. He has achieved this level of achievement and is considered a great achiever.

The inheritance of our Speech Blessing Mantra is the inheritance of Master Qiongwu.

The inheritance of Master Qiongwu slowly spread to Dharma Master Yongzeng.

In the presence of Dharma Master Yongzeng, I received several Speech Blessing Mantras.

If you want to achieve success in reciting mantras, and if you want the power of mantras to come out, you must practice mantras and blessings.

After cultivating the Speech Blessing Mantra, ordinary right and wrong can be turned into mantras.

Rako Rinpoche said: "I don't have so much extravagance to make right and wrong into a mantra, I don't ask for this, I just ask that if I practice the Speech Blessing Mantra and eat onions, garlic, animal tongues, etc., it won't interfere with the ability of mantras. it is good."

Rako Rinpoche also said: "If the Speech Blessing Mantra is well cultivated, gossip can be turned into a mantra."

Master Qiongwu once said that "mantra can be increased tens of millions of times", which means that after practicing the blessing, the number of mantras recited will increase, the merit will increase, and the increase will multiply millions of times; After the Speech Blessing Mantra, the mantra will not be hindered by external forces; "Voice can attract thousands of people", if you practice well, ordinary words or unintentional jokes, no matter from which point of view, every one sounds very good. It makes sense, and I think this sentence has the effect of reminding everyone; "All sounds become mantras." If you practice good language and blessings, all sounds and gossip will become mantras, and even the sound of coughing will become a mantra, which is really incredible.

To cultivate the Speech Blessing Mantra method, you must first recite the following rituals with me: ah () on the tongue of the self-respect, the character ah turns into a full moon disk, the white om () character appears on the moon disk, the om character is surrounded by vowels, and the white color is clockwise. Arranged, there are consonant mantras on the outside, the red is arranged counterclockwise, the mantra of Dependent Origination is surrounded by the outside, the blue is arranged clockwise, the mantra is released and brought back, the blessing of the Guru Three Jewels, the deity protector of the Arhat force, the holy language man and the blessing of heaven Force, earth, water, fire, wind, cosmic force, om () ah () hum () and three mantras, white, red, yellow (blue) light and seven treasures, and eight kinds of mascots, all things are integrated into the word om.

What does it mean? When you want to practice "Speech Blessing Mantra", you have to become your own deity.

If your deity is Tara, visualize yourself becoming Tara; if your deity is Avalokitesvara, visualize yourself as Avalokitesvara.

Usually, we visualize ourselves becoming a Vajrasattva — a single Vajrasattva.

On Vajrasattva's tongue, visualize a Tibetan ah () character, this ah character becomes a moon plate, there is a flat moon on the tongue, and an om ( ) character should be visualized on the moon plate.

Visualize the "vowel mantra" on the outside of the word Om.

The "vowel mantra" is visualized along the way, which is the same as the arrangement of the hour hand we usually see, and the "vowel mantra" is visualized in a clockwise direction. It is better to visualize all these mantras in Sanskrit.

Yujia holds a mantra wheel, and it is easier to visualize when you understand the mantra wheel.

The color of the "vowel mantra" is white. Visualize the "Consonant Mantra" on the outside of the "Vowel Mantra". The color of the "Consonant Mantra" is red and visualized in a counterclockwise order. Visualize the "Dependent Origination Mantra" outside the Ziyin Mantra. The color of the "Dependent Origination Mantra" is blue and visualized in a clockwise order. For these three mantras, outside the word "Om", visualize the "Mother Mantra", then visualize the "Consonant Mantra", then visualize the "Dependent Origination Mantra", and finally visualize the "Vajrasattva" mantra outside the "Dependent Origination Mantra". If your deity is Tara, visualize the mantra of Tara outside of the Dependent Origination Mantra.

After the visualization is over, these mantras emit immeasurable rays of light, and immeasurable rays of light pervade the entire universe, the entire Buddha and Bodhisattva Pure Land, and the entire void.

After the tibetan characters are missing, the blessing of the guru, the blessing of the four deities, the blessings of the Buddhas and Tathagatas, and the blessings of all the bodhisattvas all become "Om() ah() hum()", or become white, The red and blue light melts into the mantra wheel on the tongue. The blessing of Arahants, the blessings of Dharma protectors, and the blessings of saints all turn into "Om Ah Hum", or white, red, and blue light, which melts into the mantra wheel on the tongue; The power turns into light of various colors and melts into the mantra wheel on the tongue; the gods, the dragon king, the four wheel-turning kings, and the kings of all countries, all those who have great blessings will have their blessings turned into eight auspicious treasures. , or the Seven Treasures, are integrated into the mantra wheel on the tongue; the power of the entire universe becomes the eight auspicious treasures, which are integrated into the mantra wheel on the tongue. Into the mantra wheel on the tongue, after it has melted into it, recite the heart mantra of Vajrasattva: Om Banzaer Satom Hum (or the hundred-syllable mantra). It keeps melting when the mantra is chanted.

Om Banzaer Sapon (Vajrasattva Heart Mantra)

The Vajrasattva mantra or the hundred-syllable mantra should be recited seven times, fourteen times if there is time, or twenty-one times, but at the very least seven times. After reciting, recite the "vowel mantra" and the "consonant mantra", and the "vowel mantra" and "consonant mantra" should be recited together:

Om ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah

(vowel spell)

Gaka Gaga Ah Sak Sak Sak Sing Cha Cha Cha Cha Nadatta

Datana Ba Ba Ba Ba Maya La Waha Kasa Ha Cha Soha

(Consonant Mantra)

This is the "vowel mantra" and the "consonant mantra". It should be recited more than seven times in a row. If we don't have time, we can recite it three times, but it is usually better to recite it seven times.

The pronunciation of mantras such as vowel mantras and consonant mantras must be learned from the master's accent, and mantras cannot be learned only from words, because words cannot express them.

After reciting the vowel mantra and consonant mantra, recite the "Dependent Origination Mantra":

Om Yedamah Mahe Deza Pawahe Dendikenda Taga Doha

Yawadedi Kaza Yoniludahwanwadimahaharimana

Yesoha (Dependent Origination Mantra)

The "Dependent Origination Mantra" can be recited three times, or seven times, but at least three times.

These mantras, including the mantra of "Vajrasattva", are recited seven times, and the merit is very great.

"Consonant mantra" and "vowel mantra" are the "Consonant mantra" and "vowel mantra" in Sanskrit.

Why recite the Sanskrit "Consonant Mantra" and "Votel Mantra"?

Because all the Buddhas and Tathagatas became Buddhas, they all used Sanskrit to teach sutras and preach the Dharma.

Why use Sanskrit to teach scriptures? Sanskrit is very expressive, and no other language has the same expressive ability as Sanskrit.

So Indians learn any language very quickly, because there are eight parts of the pronunciation of consonants and vowels in Sanskrit.

Some sounds come from the nostrils, some from the top of the forehead, some from the eyes, some from the base of the tongue, some from the tip of the tongue, and some from the middle of the tongue.

In short, there are eight parts of Sanskrit pronunciation, usually other languages ​​don't have so many parts, so we can't pronounce some sounds at all.

It is also difficult for ordinary people to learn Tibetan. For example, the prayers of Master Tsongkhapa are very difficult for you to learn accurately. Some sounds cannot be pronounced at all, because the language you speak has never been pronounced like this. A variety of sounds, such as "Mingmei Zaiwei Desires to see the hot sex", the "Zi" sound of "Mingmei Zai" in Tibetan, many people pronounce it "zéi", not "zéi", in short, this sound just can't be pronounced , because this sound has never been pronounced before.

Sanskrit is very expressive, so when the Buddhas teach sutras and teachings, they will definitely talk about emptiness. When talking about emptiness, it is clearer to use Sanskrit to express it, so they use Sanskrit to turn the wheel of Dharma.

Now reciting the Sanskrit "Consonant Mantra" and "Vowel Mantra", the merits and virtues of all aspects are very great.

Next, let’s talk about the Dependent Origination Mantra. The power of the Dependent Origination Mantra is equivalent to consecration.

For example, if a statue itself is not a Buddha statue, if you visualize it in your mind as a Buddha statue, and then recite the "Dependent Origination Mantra" three times on it, he is now a Buddha, and you can worship him.

The power and virtue of the mantra "Dependent Origination Mantra" is incredible, and the ability and merit of the "Dependent Origination Mantra" can be described in a book.

When we consecrate a Buddha statue, whether it is a bronze Buddha statue or a Buddha statue made of other materials, we first recite the "Dependent Origination Mantra" three times. After reciting it three times, we will be a living Buddha. The mantra is recited three times, and the Buddha statue becomes a Buddha.

If you recite the Dependent Origination Mantra, your tongue will become a vajra tongue, a vajra tongue that is indestructible, and nothing else can interfere with the ability of language and the ability of mantras.

Master Yeshe Gyatso is my master. Master Yeshe Gyatso said: The Buddha said that eating onion and garlic is sinful because it blocks the power of mantras.

But these sins can be blocked by practising the "Speech Blessing Mantra", and eating onion and garlic will not have any negative effect. This is also what the Buddha taught.

We have to believe in both teachings.

If you practice the "Speech Blessing Mantra" once in the morning, it will increase your ability to recite mantras that day.

After the mantra is finished, recite:

The word Om glows and covers the mantra wheel, the Dependent Origination Mantra melts into the consonant, the consonant merges into the vowel mantra, the vowel merges into the Om character, and it reenters the perfect moon plate. , turn it into a vajra tongue, and even small talk becomes a mantra.

What does it mean? Om in the middle of the mantra wheel on the tongue

ཨ
The characters emit light, and the whole of the mantra wheel is full of light. The white light covers the mantra wheel. After the mantra wheel is covered, the outermost part is the "Dependent Origination Mantra". In the "vowel mantra", the "vowel mantra" is integrated into the word Om, and the word Om is integrated into the moon plate on the tongue. The moon plate is originally

ཨ
The characters become, the moon plate becomes the ah character, the ah character becomes the white and red nectar, the nectar melts into the tongue, and the tongue becomes the tongue that is not bad. The outside is meat, the inside is a vajra, this is the vajra tongue.

Just visualize it in this way, and practice in the morning according to this method. Before practising, recite the Heart Sutra once. Why should I read the Heart Sutra first? Reciting the Heart Sutra in the morning can dispel demons. After the demons are eliminated, recite the Speech Blessing Mantra. All the mantras recited that day will increase, and neither the mantras nor the scriptures will be hindered.

We need to practice language and blessing. It may take an hour or half an hour at the beginning, and gradually it will become fifteen minutes, ten minutes, or even a few minutes. If you are used to visualization, a few minutes will do.

It's hard at first, but it's pretty easy once you get used to it.

The teaching on the Speech Blessing Mantra is finished, I hope everyone can cultivate to completion!

Tashi Delek!

Please arouse Bodhicitta and listen carefully!

This time I am going to talk about the Prosperity and Prosperity of Gelugpa Religion. If you understand this, you will know what Gelugpa Religion is. The founder of the Gelugpa School is Master Tsongkhapa, everyone should understand what kind of person and what kind of master Master Tsongkhapa was. 

The Fifth Dalai Lama once said that of all the great siddhas of the Tibetan areas combined, none of them are as good as Master Tsongkhapa. Some great siddhis are not as good as Tsongkhapa in terms of achievement, some are not as good as Tsongkhapa in teaching scriptures, some are not as good as Tsongkhapa in debating scriptures, some are not as good as Tsongkhapa in training disciples, so it is said that all the great siddhas in the entire Tibetan area combined are comparable to Master Tsongkhapa, and no single person is as good as Master Tsongkhapa.

Master Tsongkhapa had sixteen incomparable qualities.

The first quality is that he is unmatched in the world of transformation.

Which Buddha or Bodhisattva is reincarnated in Master Tsongkhapa? There are different prophecies in the scriptures, and there are also different prophecies in the root tantras. The sutras and continuations of the sutras are the teachings taught by the Buddha himself.

The sutras are the teachings of the sutras, and the tantras are the teachings of the tantras. Once you understand the sutras, tantras, and treatises, you will fully understand the Buddhadharma.

When Buddha Shakyamuni predicted Master Tsongkhapa, there were many different prophecies in the sutras and tantras. For example, in the Manjusri Root Tantra, it was prophesied that Master Tsongkhapa would be the reincarnation of Manjushri.

In the Vajrayana Tradition, it is prophesied that Master Tsongkhapa is the reincarnation of Vajrapani Bodhisattva.

There are also some scriptures that predict that Master Tsongkhapa would be the reincarnation of Guanyin Bodhisattva.

In "Master Tsongkhapa's Prayer", "Undestined Compassion Store Avalokitesvara", it is said that Master Tsongkhapa is the reincarnation of Guanyin Bodhisattva; he is Manjusri Bodhisattva; "the secret master of destroying the demon army", the secret master Vajra Hand, and Master Tsongkhapa is the reincarnation of Vajra Hand Bodhisattva; "Xueyu Zhiyan Tsongkhapa, praying in front of Luosang Zhahua".

Guanyin is the compassionate incarnation of the Buddhas and Tathagatas, the Vajra Hand is the incarnation of the abilities of the Buddhas and Tathagatas, Manjushri is the incarnation of the wisdom of the Buddhas and Tathagatas, and Master Tsongkhapa is the incarnation of the Three Lords.

The three parents are Avalokitesvara, Manjusri, and Vajra Hand.

There are also some scriptures in which when Master Tsongkhapa was prophesied to be the incarnation of Amitabha Buddha, and even when Buddha Shakyamuni predicted Master Tsongkhapa, Master Tsongkhapa was Buddha Shakyamuni himself. Incarnation, there is this, is not contradictory.

Because Master Tsongkhapa is the incarnation of all Buddhas and Tathagatas, this is unparalleled in the realm of transformation.

There have been many great siddhas, but none of them are the reincarnations of the Buddhas and Tathagatas. There may be the incarnations of Amitabha Buddha, the incarnation of Guanyin, the incarnation of the immovable Tathagata Buddha, and so on.

But as the incarnation of the Buddhas and Tathagatas is only Master Tsongkhapa, so the incomparable world of transformation is the first incomparable.

The second incomparable is the incomparable prophecy.

Buddha Shakyamuni once foretold many great masters in the scriptures and the fundamental tantras of Tantric Buddhism, but the predictions of each master were different.

When the prophecy of Master Tsongkhapa, "the future practice of all Buddhas and Tathagatas, the cause of all Buddhas and Tathagatas", this kind of prophecy is only available to Master Tsongkhapa, and no other great achievers.

And when the Buddha predicted Master Tsongkhapa, Master Tsongkhapa was the second Buddha, and no other great siddhas mentioned the second Buddha.

When Atisha and Nagarjuna Bodhisattva prophesied, they were also not prophesied as the second Buddha. Only Master Tsongkhapa was prophesied to be the second Buddha.

"Practice and uphold the Buddha's business of all Buddhas", the Buddha's business, "Manjushri Root Tantra" says this:

“After I pass away and my pure doctrine is absent,
You will appear as an ordinary being,
Performing the deeds of a Buddha
And establishing the Joyful Land, the great Protector,
In the Land of the Snows.”

This is the word predicted by the Buddha Shakyamuni regarding Master Tsongkhapa.

At that time, Shakyamuni Buddha said to Manjushri, After I pass away and my pure doctrine is absent.

On the earth, the Dharma door of the Mahayana is empty and no longer exists. When it is almost extinct, who will appear?

"You will appear as an ordinary being,", "ru" refers to Manjushri, Manjushri, Performing the deeds of a Buddha.

There are many actions of the Buddha, there are about twelve actions, and birth is one of them.

The birth of a Buddha is absolutely different from the birth of other people. When a Buddha is born, a Bodhi tree appears. When Master Tsongkhapa was born, there was a Bodhi tree. When any other master was born, there was no Bodhi tree.

There are also twelve practices that are similar to the Buddha, such as the practice of becoming a monk, the practice of becoming a Buddha, the practice of turning the Dharma wheel, and the practice of Nirvana. Only Master Tsongkhapa has this kind of Buddhist practice.

"Performing the deeds of a Buddha, In the Land of the Snows.", "In the Land of the Snows" refers to Tibet.

"There is Huanxi Lanruo", "Huanxi" is Ganden, and "Lanruo" is the name of the monastery, which translates to Ganden Monastery (a monastery founded by Master Tsongkhapa). The names of the monasteries built by Master Tsongkhapa can be remembered very clearly.

Gelu Shanjiao's wish to prosper said:
>
>Although he is the father of the Buddha who nurtured all Buddhas,
>
>In the immeasurable world of the Buddha's appearance,
>
>Adhering to the Dharma and generating true power of the heart,
>
>Promoting the prosperity of good Huisheng Wangjiao.
>

The father of the Buddhas and Tathagatas, the sons of the Buddhas and Tathagatas, who is this? 

This is Manjushri Bodhisattva. why do we say so? The guru of the Buddhas and Tathagatas is Manjushri Bodhisattva, the guru of Sakyamuni Buddha is also Manjushri Bodhisattva, and the guru of Burning Lamp Buddha is Manjushri Bodhisattva.

Before the Buddhas and Tathagatas became Buddhas, Manjushri Bodhisattva taught them sutras and Dharma, and then they slowly and gradually practiced and became Buddhas. After becoming Buddhas, Manjushri Bodhisattva became the disciple of the Buddhas and Tathagatas. Now the eldest son has come to promote the Dharma of the Buddhas and Tathagatas.

So Manjushri Bodhisattva is very, very great.

Master Tsongkhapa is the reincarnation of Manjushri Bodhisattva. There are incarnations of Manjushri Bodhisattva, some are incarnations of pores, some are incarnations of hair, some are incarnations of tears, some incarnations of body parts, or part of the great wisdom incarnation.

For example, Green Tara and White Tara. When Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva purifies sentient beings, he finds that sentient beings in the three evil realms are in great pain.

Seeing the suffering of beings in the three evil realms, Guanyin Bodhisattva expressed great compassion, and two tears flowed from both eyes. The tear from the left eye became Green Tara, and the tear from the right eye became White Tara.

Green Tara and White Tara are the tearful incarnations of Guanyin Bodhisattva, but Master Tsongkhapa is not such an incarnation.

When the prophecy of Master Tsongkhapa, "You have a different appearance", the incarnation of Master Tsongkhapa is not only a part, it is the real body of Manjushri Bodhisattva, and it is the incarnation of Manjushri Bodhisattva's real body, so it is said that Manjusri Bodhisattva's incarnation Avatars are also different.

How great is Manjushri Bodhisattva, how great is Master Tsongkhapa.

How great the merits and virtues of the Buddhas and Tathagatas, the great merits and virtues of Master Tsongkhapa, everyone should understand.

Therefore, it is said that Manjushri is the father of all Buddhas and Tathagatas, the master of all Buddhas and Tathagatas, and the eldest son of all Buddhas and Tathagatas.

In the "Buddha's Talk about Putting the Bowl", it is said that Buddha Shakyamuni once said, "Now that I have attained Buddhahood, I have thirty-two signs and eighty kinds of goodness, and those who are majestic and noble, and those who save all sentient beings in the ten directions, are all by the grace of Manjushri. ".

He had thirty-two signs and eighty kinds of goodness, which is the grace of Manjushri Bodhisattva.

In the past, countless Buddhas and Tathagatas were all disciples of Manjushri Bodhisattva.

When the comers are also due to their power and grace.

"For example, children in the world have parents. Manjushri, parents in Buddhism and Dharma."

That is to say, children in this world have father and mother.

All Buddhas and Tathagatas also have a father and a mother, including Manjushri Bodhisattva.

Manjushri Bodhisattva, some scriptures mention that he is the father of all Buddhas and Tathagatas, and some scriptures mention that he is the mother of all Buddhas and Tathagatas.

He is a father and a mother, what do you say? When Manjushri Bodhisattva preaches scriptures to all the Buddhas, he says the convenient method, and the convenient method represents the father; when he speaks the wisdom method, the wisdom method represents the mother, so sometimes Manjushri Bodhisattva is said to be his father, and sometimes he is said to be his mother.

In the "Heart Viewing Sutra", it is said that "the three worlds feel the wonderful auspiciousness", and the wonderful auspiciousness is Manjusri Bodhisattva.

And "See All Land Sutra" said that "the Buddhas of the three generations have become Buddhas because of Manjushri, and Manjushri is the father of all Buddhas".

After talking about this, we can understand that "although he is the Buddha's father who nurtures all Buddhas" means this.

"Now in the immeasurable world of Buddha's appearance".

"The appearance of the Buddha's son", Manjushri Bodhisattva teaches those who have not become Buddhas. After they become Buddhas, Manjusri Bodhisattva becomes their disciple to promote the Dharma.

"Manjushri Roots" says "Manjushri Bodhisattva, for the sake of saving sentient beings, appears as the body of the eldest son of all Buddhas".

"Adhering to the Dharma and generating the true power of the heart, promote the prosperity of the teaching of the King of Victory."

"Shanhui" is the name of Master Tsongkhapa, and the name of Master Tsongkhapa in Tibetan is "Lobsang Drakpa".

"Lobsang Drakpa" is "good wisdom" or "virtuous".

"The King of Victory" is the Buddha, the Buddha is called the King of Victory, and Master Tsongkhapa is the second Buddha, so it is called the King of Victory Tsongkhapa.

"Promote the prosperity of good Huisheng Wangjiao", which refers to the power of Manjushri's vows, and the method of Master Tsongkhapa can last for a long time.

Maitreya Bodhisattva once foretold Master Tsongkhapa. Maitreya Bodhisattva said: "He is like the Buddha who appeared in the world and accomplished great things."

In the Tibetan area, there is a sect known as the Shishen sect. It mainly cultivates a Dharma door for the body to give to sentient beings. The founder of the sect of renunciation is Machig Labdrön.

Machig Labdrön must have been a reincarnation of Tara, and she could read the Mahaprajna Sutra on the day she was born. It was 454 years after Machig Labdrön passed away that Master Tsongkhapa was born.

Before Machig Labdrön passed away, she called all her disciples and said, "In the future, the second Buddha in our Tibetan area, Lobsang Drakpa, will be born, and you all will vow to be his disciples."

To be a disciple of Tsongkhapa is to be a disciple of all the Buddhas and Tathagatas. Everyone should make this vow.

Machig Labdrön said, "The way of establishing the Dharma with Bhikkhu Losang Drakpa is the same as that of Buddha Shakyamuni turning the wheel of Dharma", which means that the teaching method of Master Tsongkhapa is the same as that of Buddha Shakyamuni turning the wheel of Dharma. !

It was once said that the Bodhisattva also had a prophecy. About 600 years after the Bodhisattva passed away, Master Tsongkhapa was born. Before Yueshen Bodhisattva passed away, he also asked his disciples to vow to be disciples of Master Tsongkhapa. Yuecheng Bodhisattva said: "There is a person named Lobsang in the snowy area of ​​the borderland, who can promote the unparalleled holy teaching of the Buddha." This is the prophecy. So there are very, very many prophecies about Master Tsongkhapa.

In a previous life, I was in front of Zizai Buddha,

When a great mind is risen, 

the Buddha and the disciples of the Buddha,

Known as the true power of the great warrior,

Promoting the prosperity of good Huisheng Wangjiao.

I will tell you about the past life of Master Tsongkhapa. Long, long ago, the Buddhas and Tathagatas once transformed into a monk. This monk was the previous life of Master Tsongkhapa. This monk's name is the Great Warrior.

Why is he called the Great Warrior? He used to be the younger brother of Manjushri Bodhisattva called Zizai Ding Buddha. When Zizai Ding Buddha turned the Dharma wheel, Manjushri took countless Bodhisattvas to visit Zizai Ding Buddha.

Manjushri Bodhisattva encourages the bodhisattvas to make vows to promote the Buddhadharma in the Dharma-ending and Douzheng eras.

All bodhisattvas have supernatural powers. From the perspective of their supernatural powers, what are the sentient beings in the age of the end of the Dharma? 

At first glance, the afflictions and karmic obstacles of sentient beings in the age of the end of the Dharma are extremely great.

Therefore, the bodhisattvas do not dare to make vows.

At this time, a Bodhisattva among the disciples stood up, and made a vow after the three prostrations before Zizai: In order to save all sentient beings in the age of the end of the Dharma and the age of conflict, I have come to promote the dual cultivation of the exoteric and the esoteric, and to promote the true teaching of the exoteric and tantric.

He made such a wish.

Because of this vow, the pure land of the Buddhas and Tathagatas shook.

At this time, all the Buddhas and Tathagatas uttered the same voice of admiration: 

You are a great warrior among the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas! 

This real power makes the teaching of the King Shanhuisheng prosper.

In order to spread the flow of pure Dharma,

Offering crystal rosary to Buddha,

Returning the true power of the Faluo prophecy,

Promoting the prosperity of good Huisheng Wangjiao.

There are two types of esoteric methods: esoteric right view and esoteric conduct.

In order to carry forward the dharma door of sutra, the Buddhas and Tathagatas transformed into a monk in the time of Buddha Shakyamuni. This monk is called Lotus monk.

Bhikkhu Lotus offered a string of crystal rosary in front of Buddha Shakyamuni, and made a vow in front of Buddha Shakyamuni: 

In order to save all sentient beings in the age of the end of the Dharma and the age of conflict, I have come to promote the method of dual cultivation of sutra and tantra, Righteousness.

Buddha Shakyamuni said in the "Teaching and Teaching the King's Sutra": 

Ananda, now before me,

For the crystal boy, you can inspire me to teach the Dharma,

In the future turbid world, at the junction of Tibetan areas,

The temple was built with a Gan name, and its people came out of Lobsang.

So foreshadowed. Buddha Shakyamuni said to Venerable Ananda that the monk who offered me the crystal rosary just now will promote the righteous Dharma of Buddha Shakyamuni in the future.

Seventy-seven and forty-nine days after Buddha Shakyamuni became enlightened, he did not preach the scriptures and preach the Dharma, so the Emperor Shakyamuni and the Great Brahma asked Buddha Shakyamuni for the Dharma.

When seeking the Dharma, Di Shitian offered a conch shell, and the Great Brahma offered a prayer wheel.

After the two of them asked for the Dharma, Buddha Shakyamuni taught the scriptures and spread the Dharma.

At that time, Buddha Shakyamuni gave the conch shell used for Dharma-seeking to Venerable Mugallian, and said, "Mulkanlian, use your supernatural powers to go to the Tibetan area. There is a mountain in the Tibetan area called Mieding Mountain. Dingshan."

Tsongkhapa would dig it out when he built a monastery, and in the future this conch will be used as the conch for the monastery.

"That's it.

Venerable Mujianlian buried the conch in Mieding Mountain.

When Master Tsongkhapa was building Ganden Monastery, he dug this conch out of many rocks on the edge of the cliff.

There is also Yama, a long, long time ago, who was a demon before he was subdued.

The city where he lives has sixteen gates, and the Demon King has harmed many, many sentient beings.

At that time, the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas discussed together, who would save this demon king.

When discussing, Manjushri said:

"I will transform, I will become an angry deity, and I will show my anger to subdue him."

Then Manjushri showed great mighty virtue, he pressed down the sixteen doors with sixteen feet, and then surrendered to the Yama King.

King Yama has a bone rod in his hand, which is made of human bones.

Because King Yama was very afraid at that time, he offered the bone stick to Dawei De and said, "From now on, I will listen to you, and I will be your disciple and protect your Dharma door."

Daweed said:

"I'll give this bone stick to you now. You go to the Tibetan area. There is a Mieding Mountain in the Tibetan area. You bury it in the Mieding Mountain. In the future, this bone stick will be taken out by Tsongkhapa. Whoever gets it in the future, whoever gets it is Tsongkhapa's tantric successor."

When Master Tsongkhapa built the monastery, the bone rod was dug out.

It was later passed on to Master Xirao Sangge, who was a disciple of Master Tsongkhapa's tantric lineage.

Guru Padmasambhava once also foretold Master Tsongkhapa, and in the Book of Prompts, he said:

The King of Reverence and Faith listened to this. When the Buddha was alive, Upali,

When entering Nirvana, Wuguba. Bawa Bazha Zhucheng said,

In the east, near the land of Han, Bhikkhu Lobsang will be born.

Guru Padmasambhava said in "The Legacy of the Lotus":

Manjushri incarnates the Dharma Master, Lobsang Drakpa holds the sutra,

To carry forward the eight generations of Xiantanjing, before Maitreya,

Once you become a Buddha, you will inherit the lineage, and in the natural catastrophe,

There is no doubt that the Arhat is proved.

Vajrapani said:


Lobsang Drakpa is incomparable and has a hundred lives as a Panzhida.

Master Tsongkhapa once made a five-sided Buddha crown for the twelve-year-old statue of Sakyamuni Buddha in the Jokhang Temple, praying for the Dharma to live in the world for a long time.

For this matter, the Buddha also has a prophecy.

In Teaching the Professor Wang Jing, it says:

A famous man from Lobsang appeared, and there were many disciples in the assembly.

He always established the ten dharmas. In the Buddha hall with leaf pillars,

There are two statues in my body, offering the five buddhas solemn crowns,

Such as the righteousness of the Buddhist scriptures. Praying in harmony with Yam,

I am good at writing prayers, and the teaching will last for a thousand springs.

From then on, in the East, in the world of excellence and solemnity,

The name of becoming a Buddha is the lion's roar;

Be faithful to him.

Padmasambhava prophesied again:

The prophecy of Buddha Shakyamuni, the handsome man came out of Domai,

Lobsang Drakpa is in a state of impoverishment. He is Atisha incarnate,

As soon as this great man is born, the whole of Tibet will be blessed,

The prosperity of all industries is self-evident.

Among them, Lobsang Drakpa is the name of Master Tsongkhapa.

This is the incomparable prophecy. The second one is unparalleled.

The third incomparable is the incomparable birth, that is, the incomparable birth and the birth.

Master Tsongkhapa was born and passed away on the same day, which is the twenty-fifth of the tenth month of the lunar calendar. When Master Tsongkhapa was born, as soon as the umbilical cord was cut, a drop of blood fell to the ground, and a white sandalwood tree grew on the ground where the blood was dripping. The white sandalwood tree had 100,000 leaves.

The leaves of this tree are very, very unique. On each leaf, there is a Buddha statue of a lion roaring Buddha on the front, and the mantra of Manjusri Bodhisattva on the back. In fact, this tree is a Bodhi tree.

Except for the Buddha, this kind of auspicious appearance of the Bodhi tree is only heard of when Master Tsongkhapa was born. Others will not have this kind of auspicious appearance of the Bodhi tree, indicating that Master Tsongkhapa is the second coming of the Buddha.

He was born unparalleled.

The fourth incomparable is the incomparable understanding of the practice of Dharma.

Kezhujie once said that in the past, the Bodhisattva of India and the Tibetan Master Buton were two masters who were very familiar with the scriptures, but they were not as completely knowledgeable as Master Tsongkhapa in all the scriptures. Master Tsongkhapa has mastered not only one or two scriptures, but also two kinds of "Tripitaka", namely "Kangyur" and "Tengyur". Only Master Tsongkhapa is the only one who has mastered the 84,000 Dharma-doors of sutra and tantra, and no one else can be found. Emperor Qianlong's master Zhangjia Living Buddha said that the biography of Master Tsongkhapa is mainly to understand all the profound Dharma.

Master Tsongkhapa said in the Biography of Good Prescriptions:

Therefore, due to the promised Dharma Master Ci Shizun

And the world's two wins six solemn

their teachings are one-sided or sketchy

Don't feel satisfied with all the detailed study

Thinking about this principle has good strategies

With great grace, supreme wisdom treasure

The fifth incomparable is that all the Holy Word is now taught incomparable.

The Holy Word is now taught unparalleled. The holy words of the Nyingma school are now called Dzogchen, the Kagyu school is Mahamudra, the Sakya school is the Daoguo, and the Kadam school is the San Shi Dao. All of these sects have only a portion of the Holy Word now taught.

Master Tsongkhapa is proficient in all the sutras, tantras, treatises, and the lineages of various schools, such as Nyingma's Great Perfection, Kagyu's Mahamudra, Sakya's Path and Fruit, Kadam's Three Paths, and so on. The essence of the Dharma is all integrated into the teaching of Master Tsongkhapa. Therefore, the teaching of all the sutras, tantras, and scriptures is the unique characteristic of the teachings of Tsongkhapa's generation.

Everyone should know that the Dharma door of our Gelug School is the most complete and most essential of the Dharma doors.

The purest sect in which the lineage is all blended together is the Gelug sect.

The methods of other sects are all found in the Gelug sect, and the methods of the Gelug sect may not necessarily exist in other sects.

For example, only the Gelug Sect has the thirteen great Dharma gates, and the other sects do not. It was personally empowered by the Great Weed Vajra to Master Tsongkhapa.

Master Tsongkhapa has studied under more than 40 teachers, including teachers of Nyingma, Kagyu, Sakya, Kadam and other schools.

He has learned the methods of various sects, so the Gelug sect created by Master Tsongkhapa is different from other sects.

Now in our Tibetan area, there are usually many other sects who go to the Gelug sect to study, but the Gelug sect did not go to other sects to study, because there are other sects in the Gelug sect, so they do not need to go to other sects to learn.

There are hundreds of monks in our Tuole Monastery. Except for more than 100 monks from the Gelug sect, the other monks are from the Nyingma sect, the Kagyu sect, the Sakya sect, and the Jonang sect. There are monks from each sect. 

Come to Tuole Temple to study.

The sixth incomparable is the incomparable right view.

Wisdom sees innocence far away from the ever-breaking edge,

Quietness and innocence eliminate darkness,

Act purely, and strictly follow the Buddhist commandments,

May the victorious Lobzang Drakpa's teachings flourish and spread!

"Innocence of wisdom far from the edge of permanence" is the incomparable right view.

Our right view of emptiness is Nagarjuna Bodhisattva's Madhyamika right view.

What is middle view? Between the constant edge and the broken edge is the middle view.

What is a cut edge? If the self-nature does not exist, all dharmas do not exist. If you understand it in this way, you will fall into the edge of renunciation.

Those who fall on the side of the broken will think that there is no cause and effect, that there is nothing at all.

Such people think that all dharmas are emptiness, emptiness is emptiness, and emptiness means nothing.

But emptiness is not the same as nothingness.

What does emptiness mean? The self-nature of all things does not exist, but all things still exist, and all the five senses such as eyes and ears exist.

The self-nature of the five senses does not exist. If you say that the five senses do not exist, then you have fallen into a broken edge.

Right now, there are more people who fall on the edge of breaking. Those who talk about emptiness, those who talk about emptiness, and those who contemplate emptiness will say: There is nothing, there is no cause and effect, there is no need to be attached, and there is no need to be afraid.

Not like this.

So what is Changbian? If all dharmas and myriad things exist, they must have their own nature.

Madhyamika believes that all things exist, but have no self-nature.

Ordinary people fall into the broken side or the permanent side.

It is not as good as falling to the permanent side, and falling into the broken side will lead to wrong views and fall into the evil path.

The right view of our Gelugpa is Madhyamika right view.

The Madhyamika school is divided into the Madhyamika Self-Continuation School and the Madhyamika Yingcheng School, and the right view of our Gelug School belongs to the Madhyamika Yingcheng School.

In the past, the great achievements of the teachers in Tibetan areas were divided into the teachers of the previous generation and the teachers of the later generations.

All the teachers before Tsongkhapa are called the teachers of the previous generation, and the teachers after Tsongkhapa are called the teachers of the future generations.

There are no works written by previous generations of theorists that deal with emptiness in detail, nor are there any commentaries that really explain emptiness.

With Master Tsongkhapa we begin to have such writings.

Master Marpa taught about Mahamudra, and the work of Mahamudra is only a few sheets of paper, not very thick.

There are five books by Master Tsongkhapa on emptiness, and they are very thick.

In these five works, Master Tsongkhapa explained very clearly what emptiness is, and he explained each part in great detail and with great clarity.

What Master Marpa taught is the fundamental theory, which says that all dharmas are emptiness. As for what is emptiness? How to view the void? None of this is said.

Guru Padmasambhava is the same.

Therefore, the previous generations of commentators did not leave a detailed work on emptiness.

There are five books on emptiness left by Master Tsongkhapa. Not only have they survived, but they are now widely circulated. This is one of the characteristics of Master Tsongkhapa. The right view is unparalleled.

The seventh incomparable is the incomparable practice.

The practice is unparalleled, referring to "quiescence and purity eliminate darkness".

Tranquillity is about contemplating emptiness and practicing meditation.

There are two obstacles to meditating: the first is the mind of restlessness, and the second is the mind of lethargy.

It's easier for everyone to understand that when you lose your mind, it refers to a distracted mind.

The heart is scattered, the heart is chaotic, and the heart is lost.

For example, when the body is meditating and the mind goes outside, it is not really meditating.

Shen Shen, especially Shen, is difficult to understand.

When you are meditating, your mind is calm, and you want to visualize a Buddha statue, such as Shakyamuni Buddha, a very small Buddha Shakyamuni.

Once you have seen it, your mind remains fixed on the body of Buddha Shakyamuni, and it is as if your mind is still.

It is settled, but if the fixation is indistinct, it is gross sinking; if the fixation is not bright, it is subtle sinking.

The meditation must be bright. If the meditation is not bright, the more you meditate, the more stupid you will become.

There used to be a lama in the Tibetan area who was meditating, and he fell into this drowsy mind.

The coarse Shen only knows a little bit, but the fine Shen does not understand.

Then he thought that the meditation was successful, but the more he meditated, the more stupid he became. How stupid is he? His disciple brought him tea, and he asked what it was? He doesn't even know tea! Then the disciple said, "Master, please drink some tea."

When he really wanted to drink tea, his disciple took a cup and made it look like he was drinking tea, and he followed suit. The disciple drank it, and he drank it too.

It's so stupid that you can't even drink tea.

The masters of the previous generation practiced meditation and cultivated more of the above.

Many places now practice meditation.

A Korean disciple said:

"The more I practice meditation, the more stupid I become, but my master said that the more stupid the better, so I can forget all my troubles."

This is actually delusion.

Master Tsongkhapa can distinguish what is subtle Shen, what is subtle faint.

A drowsy mind is like wanting to sleep, a heavy body is a thick dizziness, and a body that is only a little heavier is a thin dizziness. Most people can't tell the difference, but Master Tsongkhapa can distinguish it very clearly.

Therefore, there are many masters who practice meditation and this becomes real meditation in future generations. This is an unparalleled aspect of Master Tsongkhapa's practice.

The eighth incomparable is the incomparable behavior.

The unparalleled behavior is to say "the behavior is pure and strict according to the Buddhist commandments".

In the past, some monks in various monasteries in Tibetan areas did not behave in accordance with the law. They don't know the three robes of monks, not even the ancestral robe, the seven robes, and the bowl.

What is a bowl? Bowls are used by monks to eat, and they don't even know about it. Master Tsongkhapa vowed to strictly observe the precepts again.

Master Tsongkhapa rebuilt the Tibetan Jampa (Maitreya Buddha).

After Maitreya Buddha was repaired, Master Tsongkhapa offered the monks' seven robes, three robes, bowls, etc., all of which were offered to Maitreya Buddha, and then made a vow: Now many monks' precepts are not up to the law, and I will strictly obey the Buddhist precepts again.

After making the vow, several years later, he taught monks' precepts, novice precepts, and Vinaya, among which the Vinaya was taught many times.

Since then, all Tibetan monks have followed the Dharma.

Many of Master Tsongkhapa's disciples are as quiet as the Arhats in the Buddha's time.

In particular, there was a disciple named Drakpa Gyaltsen who was a successor of the precepts. When everyone saw Drakpa Gyaltsen, it was like seeing the Buddha.

This is the unparalleled merit of Master Tsongkhapa's actions.

The ninth incomparable is the incomparable debate.

In the past, there were six monasteries in Tibet, including Sangpu Monastery, Dewa Jian Monastery, and Gongtang Monastery.

In these six monasteries, Master Tsongkhapa debated the scriptures.

Master Tsongkhapa was so eloquent that no one can argue with him.

Kezhujie, the eldest disciple of Master Tsongkhapa, is also a very eloquent holy monk.

At that time, a very eloquent master Wu Dongwa emerged from Tibet.

Master Wu Dongwa went to Sakya Monastery to debate scriptures. At that time, there were more than 90,000 monks in Sakya Monastery, and more than 90,000 monks debated scriptures with him. No one could argue against Master Wu Dongwa.

At that time, Kezhujie was a very young little lama, only sixteen years old. In the end, the sixteen-year-old little lama came to debate with Master Wu Dongwa, debated, debated, and debated. In the end, Master Wu Dongwa lost the debate.

There are many stories about Kezhujie.

Kezhujie once said that "Except for Master Tsongkhapa, I am incomparably eloquent. If anyone can argue with me, I will take him as a teacher and declare it like this."

Therefore, many masters who are very good at debating the scriptures gathered together to debate with Kezhujie, and after several days of debating, no one could argue with him.

The last old lama came to argue. Just when everyone seemed to be unclear about who lost and who won, the old lama ran away. In fact, the old lama knew that he had lost.

Kezhujie believed that in debating the scriptures, it is necessary to argue who wins and who loses.

The old lama ran into a Maitreya Buddha hall and disappeared, only to hear the Maitreya Buddha statue in the hall gasping for breath.

It turned out that Maitreya Buddha turned into an old lama to argue with Kezhujie, but even Maitreya Buddha could not argue with Kezhujie.

At that time, the debate was like this, no one could argue against Kezhujie, let alone Master Tsongkhapa.

So the Master Tsongkhapa debate is unparalleled.

The tenth incomparable is the incomparable creation.

Master Tsongkhapa has 18 thick books, and these 18 books include "The Extensive Treatise on the Stages of the Path of Bodhi" and "The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Esoteric Buddhism", etc. These are all very special. Why are they so special?

There are three reasons: The first is that Master Tsongkhapa himself has mastered all scriptures.

The second is that when he wrote each book, the deity Buddha and Bodhisattva allowed and encouraged him to write it.

When Master Tsongkhapa wrote The Extensive Treatise on the Stages of the Path to Bodhi, all the lineage teachers showed up to encourage him.

At the end of the writing of The Broad Treatise on the Stages of the Bodhi Path, Master Tsongkhapa felt that people didn't understand too much about emptiness, so he simply wrote it briefly.

When he had such thoughts, Manjushri appeared, and Manjushri encouraged him to write more and write more widely.

Because every time I write an article, it is encouraged by Buddhas and Bodhisattvas, so it is very special.

The third is inheritance. Every book he wrote has inheritance, so it is very special. This is unparalleled in creation.

What we write now is neither inherited nor proficient in the Dharma, and the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas do not allow us to write, or do not encourage us to write, or just write randomly. This is very different.

The eleventh incomparable is the incomparable training of disciples.

This is very, very special.

Among the disciples cultivated by Master Tsongkhapa, there are two Venerables, Kezhujie and Jia Caojie, a disciple of the Tantra lineage, Xirao Sangge, who has become a Buddha, and three Vajra disciples who have become a Buddha: Dharma Master Kong and Karma King Kong. , Ming Jingjing, and a disciple who became a Buddha, Duo Dan Jianbai Gyatso.

Master Tsongkhapa trained more than a dozen disciples who became Buddhas in one lifetime, more than 100 who attained the status of Bodhisattva in their lifetime, and more than 7,000 who attained Bodhicitta through ordinary practice. There are tens of thousands of disciples who have accomplished the concept of impermanence in life, so cultivating disciples is unparalleled.

You can see that Master Marpa cultivates disciples is also very extraordinary, but among the disciples he cultivated in his life, only Venerable Milarepa became a Buddha. This is already very, very remarkable.

And Master Tsongkhapa has trained more than a dozen disciples to become Buddhas in one lifetime, and there are not so many disciples of any other master who become Buddhas in one lifetime.

This is unparalleled in training disciples.

The twelfth incomparable is the incomparable Buddhist cause.

There are many unparalleled Buddhist undertakings, the most important of which are as follows.

The first one is the establishment of the Monlam Festival from the first to the fifteenth day of the first lunar month.

This puja was created by Master Tsongkhapa.

In this dharma meeting held by Master Tsongkhapa, the tormas offered by everyone every day are like mountains.

Every day, more than 100,000 candles are offered, and more than 100,000 cups of water are provided. Tens of thousands of people come to make offerings and pray to Buddha together, starting from Master Tsongkhapa until the "Cultural Revolution".

After the "Cultural Revolution", India has persisted until now.

The second is the Ganden Monastery founded by Master Tsongkhapa.

Ganden Monastery is a monastery personally ordained by Shakyamuni Buddha.

According to the biography of Master Tsongkhapa, every mandala in Ganden Monastery was made by heavenly craftsmen.

Master Tsongkhapa said: 

I need such a mandala tomorrow.

And I painted this mandala. After I painted the mandala, the celestial craftsman arrived that night and started to build the mandala. By the next morning, the mandala was built. A total of sixteen mandala were built. Very special.

The third one is the Tsacha Buddha statue printed by Master Tsongkhapa at the place of Tashi Doka.

Since the printing of the Buddha statues in Tashi Doka is very popular, many people who make Buddha statues have also come there and have been making Buddha statues.

One day, a very special person who made Buddha statues came to Master Tsongkhapa. He said that I can make Buddha statues, and I can make Buddha statues of Master Tsongkhapa, and I can make seven statues in one day.

Master Tsongkhapa said that if you make seven Buddha statues a day, then I can shave seven times a day, and each time the hair will not be lower than the height of a finger.

Then the person who made the Buddha statue really made seven statues of Master Tsongkhapa in one day. As soon as the statue of Master Tsongkhapa was made, his hair grew as long as a finger, and after shaved, it grew so long again. Shaved seven times a day.

These Buddha statues are called Anzalma in Tibetan, and the Chinese translation is "I resemble Buddha statues", which means that they are very similar to me.

Master Tsongkhapa saw this Buddha statue and said: 

"Oh, very much like me."

So it is called "I am like a Buddha statue".

The thirteenth incomparable is the aspiration to be incomparable.

Master Tsongkhapa's vow is to prolong the Dharma for a thousand years.

The vow has just been said, and everyone understands it.

The fourteenth incomparable is to speak of incomparable.

Master Tsongkhapa's sermons are unparalleled.

For example, when talking about emptiness, because Master Tsongkhapa is the reincarnattion of Manjushri, he can express emptiness in words, but it is very difficult for other people who have realized emptiness to express it in words.

Master Tsongkhapa often preached scriptures during his summer residence.

The previous Xia An residence time was three months, and the current Xia An residence time is one and a half months.

Once during his three-month stay in Xia'an, he continued to lecture on sutras and preached 17 sutras, which only Master Tsongkhapa could do, and this is also unprecedented in history.

The seventeen sutras are "The Five Treatises of Maitreya", "The Treatise on Refusal", "The Sixty Right Theory", "The Treatise on the Seventy Emptiness", "The Treatise on Jingyan", "The Treatise on Collections", and "The Treatise on Kushe" , "The Theory of Interpretation", "Theory of Entering the Practice", "Theory of Entering the Middle Stage", "The Four Hundred Treatises" and so on.

Master Tsongkhapa's teachings are unparalleled. He only taught the Dharma once, more than a hundred times by other masters.

The Dharma taught by Master Tsongkhapa will last for a long time.

For example, the Dharma of Kalachakra, Master Tsongkhapa taught it only once, and then the disciples carried it forward and carried it forward continuously until now.

This can only be done by Master Tsongkhapa.

Like many of the dharmas we have taught, we have repeated it for innumerable times, and it is hard to say how long it can be propagated.

The fifteenth incomparable is the incomparable practice of right conduct.

Master Tsongkhapa possesses the same merits as Shravaka, and possesses the precepts of serenity, renunciation, and so on.

He possesses the same qualities as Bodhisattvas, such as bodhicitta, samadhi, supernatural powers, six prajnamitta, emptiness, and so on.

**Six perfections: Generosity, Mindfulness, Patience, Effort, Meditation, Wisdom.**

The merits of the tantric vehicle, the practice of the non-duality of emptiness (emptiness and great happiness), the second stage of tantra (the stage of generation and the stage of completion), and so on.

This is the fifteenth incomparable.


The sixteenth incomparable is the founding denomination incomparable.

The Gelug Yellow Hat Sect has a history of more than 600 years.

Before the Gelugpa sect of the Yellow Hat appeared, many sects arose in Tibetan areas, and when Master Tsongkhapa was studying, sects also appeared constantly. Therefore, there were five large sects and 18 small sects in Tibetan areas.

After Master Tsongkhapa established the Gelugpa sect of the Yellow Hat, no new sects appeared, and all those small sects were integrated into the Gelugpa School.

We know that after the Nyingma school, the Sakya school and the Kagyu school appeared, but the Nyingma school did not merge into the Sakya school and the Kagyu school.

After the Gelugpas appeared, many small factions in the past were integrated into the Gelugpa faction, but now there is no separate faction of them.

After the Gelug Sect appeared, no new sect has appeared. Why? Because there is no more special method than that taught by Master Tsongkhapa, there is no more noble and pure method than Master Tsongkhapa's method, so there are no other new schools.

This is different from before. After the Nyingma Sect of the Red Hat appeared, the Kagyu Sect appeared again.

Master Marpa felt that the Nyingma sect had Dzogchen but no Mahamudra. He had Mahamudra, so he could set up a Mahamudra sect, so he founded the Kagyu sect.

Then the first patriarch of the Sakya sect thought that he had the method of Daoguo, but neither the Nyingma sect nor the Kagyu sect, but he had it, so a Sakya sect was established.

Afterwards, Venerable Atisha of Kadam felt that the San shi Dao sect did not exist in the Nyingma sect, nor the Kagyu sect, nor the Sakya sect, but only his.

Factions kept popping up.

After the establishment of Master Tsongkhapa's Gelugpa, various sects were integrated into it, and no new sects appeared.

Everyone should know this.

The above are the sixteen incomparable qualities of Master Tsongkhapa.

Learn a lot and become a good teacher,

Combining what you have learned with seeing and doing is wisdom,

All devotion to the common good and virtue,

May the victorious Lobzang Drakpa's teachings flourish and spread!


"Learn a lot to become a good teacher." To become a good teacher, you must learn a lot and hear a lot.

Whether you become an Arhat, a Bodhisattva, or a Buddha, you must first become a good teacher.

To become a good teacher, you must learn a lot, learn a lot, and learn a lot.

The Tripitaka, more than one hundred volumes of the Kangyur, and more than two hundred volumes of the Tengyur, must be studied.

Then there is also the need to study the theories. There are some mistakes in the theories studied by the previous generations of the teachers, but there are no mistakes in the theories studied by the later generations of teachers, because Master Tsongkhapa has already sorted them out.

These theories are to be learned.

We can't learn so many methods, at least we have to learn the "San shi Dao".

Our "Recitation Collection" is the essence of the "Tripitaka", all the essence is concentrated in this Dharma book, we must study this "Recitation Collection" Dharma Book carefully.

To what extent do you want to learn?

Learn to be good.

"What you have learned combined with seeing and doing is wisdom." 

To become a sage, it's just useless to talk about it. You have to actually practice what you learn. That is to say, you have to learn and practice. If you succeed in your practice, you are a sage. "

All devotion to the common good and virtue." "Good virtue" is Bodhicitta.

When reciting the devotion to the text, one should dedicate the merits and virtues to sentient beings in the six realms.

There are as many living beings in the six realms as there are merits.

Don't think that there are so many sentient beings in the Six Realms. After I distribute this little merit to them, my merit will be gone. You can't think like that.

You must know that if you only dedicate your deeds to your family members, and only dedicate your deeds to your relatives, your merit will become smaller.

It is very important that our hearts should not be so small, and the hearts of learning Buddhism must be large.

When dedicating, you should study the "Puxian Xing Xing Ping" in the future.

There are 100,000 devotions of the Bodhisattva in "Psalmist's Prayer and Vows", and these 100,000 devotions are all very special.

The shortest devotion is: 

Dedication of merit and deeds: 

All beings in the six realms will be free from suffering and be happy, Dharma will live forever in the world, merit will increase day by day, disasters will be eliminated, the world will be peaceful and so on.

How good is world peace! Without war, the people can live and work in peace and contentment.

In your certainty that all teachings, provisional and definitive,

Are practical instructions applicable to the individual,

You eliminated all forms of unwholesome conduct—

May the victorious Lobzang Drakpa's teachings flourish and spread!

Everyone must understand the 'definitive meaning' and the 'provisional meaning'.

The meaning of 'definitive' is that the words of the scripture are consistent with the true content.

For example, the scriptures on the Ten Virtuous Precepts, such as not killing, not stealing, and not committing sexual misconduct, are the same in text and content.

This is the scriptures.

'Provisional meaning' is the apparent meaning of the word while the real, definitive meaning is not the same.

There was once a prince who killed his father and mother. After killing his parents, he regretted it and repented to Buddha Shakyamuni.

When he came to Buddha Shakyamuni, Buddha Shakyamuni knew his situation at the time. If he said that killing his father and mother was a sin, his heart would explode on the spot, and he would die on the spot.

So Buddha Shakyamuni told him that his parents should be killed, and he told him these words.

He also understood that the true meaning of Buddha Shakyamuni was not this, but these words played a comforting role. His heart didn't explode, he didn't die, and he was left with an opportunity to repent.

What is the real meaning of that? 

The father represents hatred and the mother represents greed. Greed and hatred should be cut off. The real meaning is this.

Buddha Shakyamuni said, I told you just now that you should kill your father and mother. The mother represents greed, and the father represents hatred. These two afflictions should be cut off. You killed your father and mother because of these two. Troubles, these two troubles killed your parents, and now you want to take revenge and cut off these two troubles.

"Parents should be killed" is 'provisional meaning'.

It is difficult for you to understand 'provisional meaning'.

The apparent meaning of the words is inconsistent with the true meaning, and it is a different matter.

Once, a bodhisattva of the 10th Bhumi (the Cloud of Dharma level) asked Shakyamuni Buddha for the Dharma of becoming a Buddha in one lifetime.

Buddha Shakyamuni told him that he could become a Buddha by reciting a mantra for seven days, and then he passed the mantra to him.

This 'mantra' has a provisional meaning, it is aimed at the Bodhisattvas of the Ten Bhumis, not at we ordinary people.

Even if we ordinary people recite this mantra all our lives, we cannot become Buddhas. You must understand this!

Some scriptures say that reciting the name of Amitabha can lead to rebirth in the Pure Land.

The precepts are very pure, the Buddha Dharma is fully understood, the heart is very pure, the Dharma of Amitabha is very proficient, and the mind is unwavering. Such a great achiever can be reborn in the Pure Land by reciting Amitabha.

It does not mean that we ordinary people can be reborn in the Pure Land by reciting one phrase, and we may not be able to be reborn in Amitabha Buddha's Land of Ultimate Bliss by reciting tens of thousands of times.

Therefore, learning should not just look at the scriptures. In the scriptures, the direct and the indirect meanings are mixed up. You don't know which is the real meaning and which is indirect. You must study the theories of Master Tsongkhapa.

Master Tsongkhapa's theories are all based on direct meaning. You can do whatever Master Tsongkhapa says. The superficial meaning of the words is the same as the real meaning. You need to know this.

"In your certainty that all teachings, provisional and definitive," Those who are truly proficient in the Buddhist Dharma see it as a violation of the definitive meaning, and those who are not proficient in the Buddhist Dharma see it as a violation of the provisional meaning.

Buddha Shakyamuni said not to kill and also said to kill father and mother. Don't these two contradict each other? 

Buddha Shakyamuni said just by reciting one phrase,Amitabha Buddha, the speaker would be reborn in the Pure Land, and he also said that  rebirth in the Pure Land would not be possible even by reciting the name many times. Are these two not contradictory? Those who are proficient in the esoteric and tantric methods will understand at first sight that it is not contradictory. 

You must know this, so you must study a lot.

There are many people in China who like to recite scriptures without learning the theories contained in the sutras.

You can't learn anything just by studying directly from the scriptures. You must learn the theories.

Only by reading the sutras and studying the Buddhist theories can you truly understand their meaning. Everyone should pay attention to this aspect!

"Are practical instructions applicable to the individual,", both understanding the provisional meaning and the definitive meaning are the way to become a Buddha.

"You eliminated all forms of unwholesome conduct—" Those who truly understand the Dharma will not slander the Dharma.

However, some people who only understand Hinayana will slander the Mahayana.

In the past, people in Hinayana who thought they were great masters also said that Mahayana Buddhism was taught by demons, and those who studied Mahayana Buddhism were the children and grandchildren of demons.

The sin of slandering the Dharma is very serious, and it attracts the same karma as killing an arhat.

Some Mahayana masters slandered the Hinayana school, saying that the Hinayana was not taught by the Buddha, and so on.

The Hinayana is also taught by the Buddha, and saying that Hinayana is not taught by the Buddha is also a great sin.

There are also some sutra masters who slander the tantric practice, and the sin is also very serious.

Some Vajrayana masters slander other dharma schools, and it is also a great sin.

Those who fully understand the Dharma will not slander the Dharma.

The "You eliminated all forms of unwholesome conduct—" here, and the biggest sin is slandering the Dharma.

We are disciples of the Gelugpa School, and we want to learn the methods and teachings of the Gelugpa School.

It is very important not to slander other dharma schools or the masters of other schools.

Having said this, I will not slander and I will be respectful. Do I have to worship them as teachers, and do I have to listen to the teachings of other sects? 
Not at all! As long as you don't slander them.

I will also tell you about learning.

It is better to study with only one master in one place.

If you learn a little here, learn a little there, and learn a little everywhere, you will always feel that there is a little conflict between what you learn here and what you learn there.

If too many doubts arise, you won't learn anything.

Therefore, the advantage of learning from only one master is that it is not disorderly.

---

You listened to explanations of the scriptural Dharma of the three collections,

Practised the three trainings, the doctrine of realization,

And set a wondrous example of life-long learning and accomplishment—

May the victorious Lobzang Drakpa's teachings flourish and spread!

---

Buddha Shakyamuni's teachings are about the three collections: sutras, laws, and theories, and the contents of the teachings are the three studies of moral precepts, concentration, and wisdom.

All we need to learn are morality, concentration, and wisdom.

Be sure to study hard.

If you really learn the content of the scriptures say, you will definitely be successful.

"And set a wondrous example of life-long learning and accomplishment—" Everyone here needs to understand, what is meant by accomplishment? Understanding is an accomplishment.

Duan is to eradicate afflictions, and wu is the realisation of emptiness.

Abandoning is the eradication of afflictions, and enlightenment is the realization of emptiness. This is knownan accomplishment.

At present, there are some masters in the Tibetan area who practice kundalini, who meditate, and who practice controlling the clear points of qi and meridians.

They often have to go into retreat: a three year retreat, a seven year retreat, and the ceiling of their hermitage has to be built a little higher, because as soon as they fly or jump, they hit their heads on the ceiling, and sometimes they go up and can't get down again, but these feats don't really count as accomplishments.

Among the kind of people who can fly to the ceiling, there are those who break their vows after exiting the retreat, and there are also those who return to the secular world.

These feats are a phenomenon of the Qi channels, not the real accomplishments. The real accomplishments are to cut off afflictions and realize emptiness.

Some people have some small supernatural powers. For example, those who are really proficient in the Book of Changes (I Ching), Feng Shui, and Bagua divination have some small supernatural powers, and they can calculate a lot of things.

You think that they have supernatural powers, but in fact they do not have any supernatural powers. Even if they have such so-called supernatural powers, they will not be liberated.

Our Gelugpa understanding of the concept of achievement is "breakthrough" (duanwu), and breaking through to realization is our idea of an achievement.

In the past when Master Tsongkhapa was alive, in the Gelug School's tantra courtyard, when the masters were chanting sutras, they wrapped their heads in cassocks. Everyone thought it was strange, but they dared not open the cassock to look.

Once, there was a donor who gave donations to the tantra school. After making offerings, he saw that the heads of every master were covered. He didn't understand what it meant.

He wanted to take a look, and when he pulled back the hood, he saw a terrifying Yamantaka, and he fainted from fright.

He didn't know that the masters were practising visualisation, that the masters were meditating and practicing, and that the great mighty virtue of the deity they visualized would really be revealed. The masters were afraid that these donors would be frightened and faint, so they covered their heads with a headcloth or hood.

Almost 90% or more of the monks in the tantric academy can visualize themselves becoming their own deities, and this situation has continued for about eight generations.

It is from Master Tsongkhapa to his eldest disciple Sherab Gyatso, from Sherab Gyatso to his disciple Huadan Sangpo, from Huadan Sangbu to his disciple Tashi Pei, etc., and so on for eight generations.

Master Padmasambhava said: 

"Manjushri incarnates as the master of teaching, Lobsang Drakpa holds the sutra, and promotes the eight generations of the sutra."

---

Outwardly peaceful and subdued through the śrāvakas' conduct;

While inwardly possessing the assurance of the two-stage yoga;

You perfectly reconciled the excellent paths of sūtra and mantra—

May the victorious Lobzang Drakpa's teachings flourish and spread!

---


What does this mean? This is the characteristic of our Tibetan Buddhism, the external practice of the Hinayana Shravaka precepts, the internal practice of the Mahayana Six Paramitas, and the second and third stages of Tantric Buddhism, namely the generation and completion stages.

"Outwardly peaceful and subdued through the śrāvakas' conduct;" The precepts of the shravakas refer to the precepts of monks. Bhikkhus have 253 precepts, and the precepts must be pure.

"While inwardly possessing the assurance of the two-stage yoga;", the generation stage and the completion stage.

"You perfectly reconciled the excellent paths of sūtra and mantra—", what does this mean? The methods of Sutra and Tantra use each other. Here are a few examples to illustrate.

For example, death, the death of human life, the Dharma of Mahayana says that death is very simple.

Real death is not so simple, you must learn tantra before you can truly understand death.

When a person really dies, the energy of the earth, water, fire, and wind in the person melts into the central meridian. These processes are only available in the tantra method. If you want to truly understand death, it is just not enough to learn the Mahayana, you need to learn the Vajrayana Dharma door, sutra and tantra complement each other.

For example, emptiness is also mentioned in the tantric methods, but it is not so clearly explained.

The Mahayana Sutras are very clear. If you want to truly study emptiness, you must study more of the writings of Master Tsongkhapa. The five major theories on emptiness belong to the Mahayana.

For example, the bardo body is mentioned in the Dharma Doors of Mahayana but only that the human body is white, and the bardo body of hell is black. The bardo body of the hell realm is black, and the height of the bardo body is almost the height of a seven- or eight-year-old child. It has all the five sense organs, has supernatural powers, and smells fragrance. That’s all.

What is the real state of the bardo? How did it form? How did it end? Only in the Vajrayana can it be explained clearly.

Another example is liberation and achievement. The Dharma door of the Mahayana says that if you cut off your afflictions, you will be liberated. It's that simple.

In the Vajrayana method, it is said: How to stop troubles? What is the breaking process like? Where did the trouble really stop? It's all very clear.

Sutras and tantras should be used together, and Mahayana and Vajrayana practitioners should learn from each other and use each other, so that we can understand Buddhist scriptures clearly.

Those who have studied the sutras but have not studied the tantras can’t speak much, but those who are not proficient in the sutras can’t speak much at all.

To combine the emptiness that is explained in the causal vehicle,

With the great bliss achieved through the fruitional vehicle’s methods,

Is the very heart and quintessence of the eighty-four thousand sections of Dharma—,

May the victorious Lobzang Drakpa's teachings flourish and spread!

---- 

Mahayana Buddhism is divided into two parts: the causal vehicle and the fruitional vehicle.

The causal vehicle is the method of the sutra, and the fruitional vehicle is the method of the tantric sect.

Why is the Dharma door of the Mahayana called causal? One only cultivates the cause of becoming a Buddha, and one cannot cultivate the fruits of Buddhahood, so it is called the causal vehicle.

The tantric method is not only the cause of cultivating Buddhahood, but also the fruition of cultivating Buddhahood.

Cultivating Buddhahood means that, before attaining Buddhahood, the Buddha's four-bodies and other fruition statuses are cultivated in the way of visualization of rebirth and perfection.

Visualize yourself as a deity, and then the deity's dharma door can be cultivated, so it is called the fruitional vehicle.

The main thing in the concept of karma is the principle of emptiness, the doctrine of emptiness

In the past, Master Tsongkhapa talked about emptiness many times. When each explanation of emptiness was almost over, many masters realized emptiness.

Once, Master Tsongkhapa talked about emptiness in the Mahavira Hall of Drebung Monastery. As a result, many people realized emptiness on the spot. One came out here, another came out there, and monks came out of the walls in all directions.

At first, Master Tsongkhapa didn't say anything about this phenomenon, until one time, an old man was praying to Buddha, and a monk came out of the Buddha statue and scared the old man unconscious.

Master Tsongkhapa said, even if your achievements are high, your behavior must be the same as that of others. From now on, you are not allowed to show supernatural powers. Our Mahavira Hall has a door. What is the function of this door? Come in through the door.

Since then, the Mahavira Hall of Drepung Monastery has been called "many auspicious doors", which means that there are many doors, and the doors are everywhere.

Master Tsongkhapa said that emptiness is so extraordinary. So very, very extraordinary.

The fruitional vehicle is mainly about great bliss, and great bliss is about the bright points of the human body's qi and channels.

There are qi channels and clear points in our bodies. These clear points are cultivated with qi. When all the clear points have entered the central channel, you can obtain great happiness. Great happiness is eternal happiness.

After attaining great bliss, you will be extremely happy every day. This bliss combined with emptiness is the essence of the 84,000 Dharma Doors. The level of this bliss can be said to greater than the happiness of all sentient beings combined, except Buddhas and Bodhisattvas. It is greater than this. Extreme happiness.

In our Buddhism, there are two aspects of practice: asceticism and blissful practice.

What is asceticism? After Buddha Shakyamuni became a monk for six years, he still did not become a Buddha. This process is considered asceticism.

Not until the two cowherds offered milk chyme to Buddha Shakyamuni, and he accepted the offering, did his body become spiritual, and then he practiced the Dharma and finally became a Buddha.

Both the Hianayana method and the Mahayana method both learned a lot from the asceticism of Buddha Shakyamuni.

Bliss is mentioned in the Dharma door of Tantra.

After Buddha Shakyamuni became a Buddha, a prince named King Enzabodhi asked Buddha Shakyamuni for the Dharma, asking him to turn the wheel of Dharma.

Buddha Shakyamuni said you should become a monk, but the prince said he couldn't do it.

Then try asceticism, he said that he can't do it.

He said he wanted to practice happily, to practice blissfully.

Buddha Shakyamuni said that if you want to practice happily, you can only practice Vajrayana, and only by practicing Vajrayana can you practice happily.

Then gave him the Dharma Vajra and gave him the empowerment.

From then on, he practised happily until he became a Buddha.

The tantric method has this kind of happy practice, which is different from ascetic practice.

It is mentioned in Mahayana that if you want to make offerings to Buddhas and Bodhisattvas, you should not only provide your own materials, your own money, etc., but also your body if possible. Therefore, some masters of Mahayana light up lamps with their fingers.

However, the tantric method clearly mentions that if you want to cultivate the qi and meridian light points, you must not damage them, and burning the fingers and lighting the lamp is a breach of precepts, and you cannot do this.

It is mentioned in Tantra that the body must be healthy in order to practice well.

There are many ways to keep the body healthy, such as the way of the Eight Tathagatas of Medicine and so on.

Happy practice is practice when all the conditions are met, so it is also necessary to obtain wealth.

There are many gods of wealth, such as white god of wealth, yellow god of wealth, red god of wealth and so on.

In the past, all the nobles of the Chinese imperial palace practiced Tantra, specializing in the methods of our Yellow Hat Gelugpa School.

When Master Tsongkhapa was alive, Zhu Di, Emperor Yongle of the Ming Dynasty, failed to invite Master Tsongkhapa three times. Finally, Master Tsongkhapa's attendant Xiangqin Qujie went.

Xiangqin Qujie arrived in Nanjing at that time, gave the Yongle Emperor empowerment, and saved the Yongle Emperor's mother.

Emperor Yongle was a very devout Buddhist.

The Han people called monks in Tibetan areas lamas, which started from Emperor Yongle.

Lama means guru.

At that time, Xiangqin Qujie brought more than 300 monks to Nanjing.

Emperor Yongle respected them very much, and not only called Xiangqin Qujie Lama, but also used the title Lama when addressing the more than 300 monks.

At that time, the teachings of our Tsongkhapa were only passed on to the nobles of the palace, and it was only practiced inside the palace, and not made public during the Ming Dynasty. It was only made public with the arrival of the Qing Dynasty.

All of the emperors of the Qing Dynasty invited masters of the Gelug School of Yellow Hats in Tibetan areas.

For example, Emperor Kangxi's master was named Lobsang Qiedan, Yongzheng Emperor's master was Ngawang Gyatso, Qianlong Emperor's master was Zhangjia Living Buddha, Jiaqing Emperor's teacher was 土官活佛 Living Buddha and so on.

All dynasties in the Qing Dynasty cultivated the Gelug School, and cultivated it openly.

The Qing Dynasty began to disclose the teachings to ordinary people.

The Tibetan Buddhist monasteries built by the emperors of the Ming and Qing dynasties in the Han region were all monasteries of the Gelug School of the Yellow Hats.

For example, Lama Temple and Baita Temple in Beijing; Potala Palace, Pule Temple and Tashilhunpo Temple in Chengde; Tayuan Temple, Shifangtang, Guanyin Temple and Zhangjia Temple in Wutai Mountain.

At that time, more than 100 Tibetan Buddhist monasteries in the Han region were all monasteries of the Gelug School of the Yellow Hats, and there were no monasteries of other sects.

In the Ming Dynasty, the Yellow Hat Gelugpa School was patronised within the imperial aristocracy, but it was not widely spread among the people, but it was spread to various sectors of the population from the beginning of the Qing Dynasty.

Therefore, in the past, the Yellow Sect was also called the Royal Sect, which refers to the sect of the emperor's palace and nobles. There is such a saying.

Chief among the guardians of the paths of the three types of individual—

Mahākāla who is swift to act, Vaiśravaṇa, Kālarūpa and the rest—

Through the power and strength of an ocean of oath-bound Dharma guardians,

May the victorious Lobzang Drakpa's teachings flourish and spread!

Who are the guardian gods of the Way of the Three Scholars? 

"Mahākāla who is swift to act" refers to the six-armed Mahakala, "Vaiśravaṇa" is the King of Tawen, and "Kālarūpa" is the Dharma Master of Yama.

Six-armed Mahakala is the guardian deity of Shang Shi Dharma, Duowen Tianwang is the guardian deity of Zhong Shi Dao, and Dharma Master Yama is the guardian deity of Xia Shi Dao. These three guardian deities are the most important Dharma guardian deities of the Gelugpa Sect.

In particular, the six-armed Mahakala and Yama, who were usually transformed into two little lamas in the presence of Tsongkhapa, came to protect Tsongkhapa.

Cooking and cleaning the room for Master Tsongkhapa were done by these two Dharma protectors.

You see here "Through the power and strength of an ocean of oath-bound Dharma guardians", countless Dharma protectors were all protecting the then Master Tsongkhapa.

When Master Tsongkhapa wrote The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path to Enlightenment, Amyé Machen, the Dharma protector, was a Bodhisattva of the tenth bhumi, and Amyé Machen became a herdsman who offered ghee and tsampa.

The same is true for the young Tangla, who also became a herdsman to provide food to Master Tsongkhapa.

After the writing of "The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path to Enlightenment", Amyé Machen, the young Tangla, and many other Dharma protectors knelt down in front of Master Tsongkhapa, requesting that their names be written into the "The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path to Enlightenment", and then at end of the original text Master Tsongkhapa wrote to them, "I wish to make up a good way to eliminate unfavorable conditions, and to help all who have the unfavorable conditions of being non-human.

In all lives, I will not give up, the true and pure path praised by all Buddhas.”

The "non-human" in the text refers to Amyé Machen, young Tangla, etc. who support the gods in the world, and they can also be liberated by protecting the gods in the world.

In short, may the lives of the glorious masters be secure,

May the world be filled with learned, venerable holders of the teachings,

And may the power and influence of Dharma benefactors increase,

So that the victorious Lobzang Drakpa's teachings flourish and spread!

"may the lives of the glorious masters be secure"

"Glorious masters" refers to teachers who are truly virtuous, and we should pray for them to stay in the world for a long time.

"May the world be filled with learned, venerable holders of the teachings." I pray that those who truly practice the Dharma of Tsongkhapa will fill the whole earth.

"And may the power and influence of Dharma benefactors increase, So that the victorious Lobzang Drakpa's teachings flourish and spread!"

Let me tell you a little bit here, we learn Buddhism, the Dharma of Mahayana, the Dharma of Vajrayana, and whichever school we take refuge in. All of us can cut off our afflictions, all of us can achieve success, all of us can become Arhats, and all of us can become Buddhas.

There are only subtle differences.

For example, the method of our Master Tsongkhapa has four very distinctive aspects: the first is health, the second is longevity, the third is wealth, and the fourth is wisdom.

These four aspects are very special. Health, Longevity, Wealth and Wisdom.

Gelugpa's approach to health is very special.

Master Tsongkhapa cultivated the Seven Tathagatas of Medicine. After practicing for a long time, when the Medicine Buddha appeared, there were not only seven Tathagatas, but eight Tathagatas. The Buddha Sakyamuni appeared in the Seven Tathagatas, and the Medicine Master Lazuli Light Tathagata was in the middle. Shakyamuni Buddha is in front, and the other Tathagatas are around.

The eight Tathagatas after they have emerged expressed the same voice: we will protect the health of the disciples who will learn from you in the future and the donors who will support you.

Because of this commitment, the health aspect is very special.

Longevity is also outstanding.

The right view of our Gelugpa School is the right view of Nagarjuna Bodhisattva. He lived for six hundred years. Yueshen Bodhisattva, a disciple of Nagarjuna, lived for more than three hundred and fifty years, and Kexiu Bodhisattva lived for more than three hundred years.

Because of their origins, Gelugpa disciples will live longer.

Why is wealth so special? Once upon a time, some masters from other schools saw that some of their own disciples had achieved a lot, and some had not.

He saw why these disciples did not achieve success, because they were seeking money and were greedy for money, so they did not achieve success.

Seeing this, they vowed that the disciples who would study with them in the future should not accumulate wealth.

Many of the previous factions were relatively weak in terms of financial resources, because their forefathers made such a wish.

Master Tsongkhapa's vows are just the opposite. Master Tsongkhapa also saw that many of his disciples have achieved, and many have not achieved.

Why is there no achievement? It's also all about making money.

After seeing this, Master Tsongkhapa made a great vow: 

In the future, these disciples will fulfill their wealth, fulfill their wishes, and practice happily in the future.

Master Tsongkhapa made offerings of Mantra for the happiness of his disciples.

Offering Mantra is the way to accumulate good fortune, and it is also the way to get wealth.

Master Tsongkhapa offered Mantra a million times and returned the blessings of offering Mantra a million times to the disciples of Gelugpa.

So usually the disciples of the Gelugpa sect, the benefactors of the Gelugpa sect, and the monasteries of the Gelugpa sect are all rich.

You can see that the six major Gelugpa monasteries in the Tibetan area are very rich.

Our Ta'er Monastery in Qinghai is so rich that it was once called "Little Hong Kong".

There is also a Labrang Monastery in Gansu.

The Panchen Lama's monastery, Tashilhunpo Monastery, is also very, very rich.

Why? All because of the will of Master Tsongkhapa.

Therefore, our Gelugpa School is usually superior in terms of financial resources.

Open up wisdom.

Master Tsongkhapa himself is the reincarnation of Manjushri Bodhisattva, Manjusri Bodhisattva is in charge of wisdom, so it is very special in opening wisdom.

You see here, "And may the power and influence of Dharma benefactors increase, aSo that the victorious Lobzang Drakpa's teachings flourish and spread!"

If you have time, you can read carefully the biography and writings of Master Tsongkhapa, and you will naturally understand more. I can't finish it here, and that's all I'm going to talk about this time.

I hope everyone can understand Tsongkhapa's good teachings.

You have encountered the good teachings of Master Tsongkhapa in your life, which shows that you are very blessed.

Be grateful for the blessings accumulated in the past life, cherish this life, practice hard, and become a Buddha as soon as possible.

Tashi Delek!

The Tuole Monastery above the "lotus platform"

Tuole Monastery is a famous monastery belonging to the Gelug Sect of Tibetan Buddhism, located in the basin between the three grasslands of Muguitan, Balegetan and Dutan in Guinan County, Hainan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Qinghai Province.

The monastery is surrounded by mountains, facing Baiguan Pilgrimage Mountain, backed by White Dragon Mountain, flanked by Dragon Mountain on the left and Phoenix Mountain on the right.

There are Turtle Mountain, Peacock Mountain, Elephant Mountain, Ba Jixiang Mountain, Foshou Mountain and other hills around like lotus petals. The monastery is located on the hill in the middle that rises like a lotus platform from among green water.

To the south of the temple, the Mangla River flows from south to north; to the north, the Yellow River flows from west to east.

There are three holy lakes to the northeast of the monastery, like three stars which have fallen to earth.

The river is like a jade belt, and the holy lakes are like beads, protecting this Buddhist holy place.

In 1916, the incarnation of Vajrapani Bodhisattva, Master Tanchen Nuori, founded the Tuole Monastery.

The master recited the six-character mantra 600 million times for the construction of the temple, and recited the "Mangala Sutra" to bless the consecration of the temple.

In 1927, the master passed away and was reborn as the 21st Dharma Master of the Pure Land of Shambhala.

To this day, the monks and believers in the monastery are still blessed by the Dharma Master.

In 2004, Guru Ngawang Gyatso began to rebuild the Tuole Monastery.

The pure precepts and perfect teachings of Tuole Monastery attract more and more monks to join.

Although this is a Gelugpa monastery, monks from various sects such as Nyingma, Kagyu, Sakya, and Joning have also gathered here to study and learn from each other.

Regarding the origin of the monastery, there have been many prophecies by the sages of the past dynasties.

On April 15, 1935, after drinking yogurt in the Potala Palace, the former Tibetan Regent Rezhen Rinpoche turned the porcelain bowl inside out and foretelled that the Tuole Monastery would become the same as the Tibetan Ganden Monastery, Drepung Monastery and Sera Monastery. The sacred place of Tibetan Buddhism is equally famous, and it is supported by believers from all over the world.

At its full capacity, the number of monks will reach 5,500.

The living Buddha left the monk's hat and the shoulders of the Dharma Master Yama as evidence.

The place where Tuole Monastery is today is called Jiarigang (meaning 'the place where the Han people are concentrated' in Chinese), which means the integration of Tibetan and Chinese.

In 1916, when Tuole Temple was built, the donations for the construction of the temple were donated by believers from both Tibetan and Han areas.

At that time, there were more than 200 Tibetans and more than 400 Han people in the five villages where the Tuole Monastery was built.

During the "Cultural Revolution", Tuole Monastery was destroyed.

In 1981, Living Buddha Yigen rebuilt Tuole Monastery by the Yellow River with donations from Tibetan and Chinese believers.

In 1984, Yigen Living Buddha moved the Monastery to its current location.

In 2004, construction began on the new Mahavira Hall and Dharma Protector Hall by Master Ngawang Gyatso, which were also jointly built by Tibetan and Chinese believers.

Therefore, no matter the past or the present, Tuole Monastery is a testimony to the harmony between Tibetan and Chinese people.

The architecture of Tuole Monastery fully embodies the characteristics of the integration of Tibetans and Chinese.

For example, the stone pillars and dragon pillars of the Mahavira Hall highlight the Han culture; the Maitreya Buddha at the entrance of the monastery, Jigong, Master Xuan Zang, Bodhidharma on the Thangka in the Buddhist Temple, and the sixteen Han-style Arhats in the Mahavira Hall all reflect the introduction of Han Buddhist culture.

The collection of scriptures in Tuole Monastery also shows the characteristics of Tibetan-Chinese fusion.

There are Chinese versions of "Qian Long Tripitaka" and so on in the Collection Pavilion.

There are also collections of Chinese Buddhist texts, such as the Complete Works of Master Hongyi.

The puja at Tuole Monastery also has the characteristics of the integration of Tibetans and Chinese.

The Mahavira Hall of Tuole Monastery was consecrated by eminent monks from Tibetan, Han and Southern traditions.

The temple holds prayers for the blessings of Guotai and Min'an every year, such as the burial of the treasure vase and the Dakini Buddha's dharma meeting, which are also attended by believers from both Tibetan and Chinese communities.

The integration of Tibetan and Chinese has become an important feature of Tuole Monastery.

Tuole Monastery, where treasures are preserved

Tuole Monastery is located in the holy place of the Dakini Buddha, and there have always been many deeds and exchanges between the dakini and eminent monks.

On the 10th and 25th of every month, the monastery holds the Dakini Buddha's Dharma Ceremony. Therefore, after the death of the monks and believers here, there are countless people who are reborn in the Dakini Buddha's Pure Land and the Land of Ultimate Bliss.
