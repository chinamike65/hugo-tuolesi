### Blessings

Thus have I heard. 
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. 

Then, late at night, a glorious deity, lighting up the entire Jeta’s Grove, went up to the Buddha, bowed, and stood to one side. 

That deity addressed the Buddha in verse:

“Many gods and humans

have thought about blessings

desiring well-being:

declare the highest blessing.”

“Not to fraternize with fools,

but to fraternize with the wise,

and honoring those worthy of honor:

this is the highest blessing.

Living in a suitable region,

having made merit in the past,

being rightly resolved in oneself,

this is the highest blessing.

Education and a craft,

discipline and training,

and well-spoken speech:

this is the highest blessing.

Caring for mother and father,

kindness to children and partners,

and unstressful work:

this is the highest blessing.

Giving and righteous conduct,

kindness to relatives,

blameless deeds:

this is the highest blessing.

Desisting and abstaining from evil,

avoiding alcoholic drinks,

diligence in good qualities:

this is the highest blessing.

Respect and humility,

contentment and gratitude,

and timely listening to the teaching:

this is the highest blessing.

Patience, being easy to admonish,

the sight of ascetics,

and timely discussion of the teaching:

this is the highest blessing.

Austerity and celibacy

seeing the noble truths,

and realization of extinguishment:

this is the highest blessing.

Though touched by worldly conditions,

their mind does not tremble;

sorrowless, stainless, secure:

this is the highest blessing.

Having completed these things,

undefeated everywhere;

everywhere they go in safety:

this is their highest blessing.”
