Can get rid of all fears as a refuge, the truth is not empty, there is no other place, devoutly take refuge in the Three Jewels to receive learning, do not follow and seek blessings.

Black and white karma feels bitter and joyful fruits, and each should practice diligence and stop doing it.

In order to get rid of suffering and rely on the three learnings, as called by the Buddha of renunciation and virtue, I would like to uphold the precepts of liberation for life, like protecting the eyeballs for blessings.
However, although liberation can be obtained, it is a pity that it is self-interested and not perfect. I hope that the practice can fulfill the two beneficial actions, and enter the Mahayana path to seek blessings.

If you know that you have kindness, you will give up, and there is someone who seems to be inferior to me. 

Therefore, you should repay the suffering, and give victory and joy to seek blessings.

There is no happiness such as a benevolent mother, I use my body, wealth and good roots to give, May all sentient beings be happy, and everything is perfect and seek blessings.

Mother and other sentient beings are compelled by suffering, and I wish to leave the cause and fruit of suffering, even if there are any remaining disasters, I will bear it on my behalf, and I will diligently cultivate compassion and seek blessings.

Since he has no desire for suffering, he wishes to obtain peace and happiness with the same mind, his pursuit of happiness is just like mine, and he looks for blessings from others.

Love is the cause of all suffering, and love is the root of all good things. The difference between birth and Buddha arises from this, and it is exchanged for others to seek blessings.

With my goodness and joy in all causes and effects, his suffering and cause and effect are completely inexhaustible, just like the wind to come and go, choose and choose, and thus seek blessings from this heart.
