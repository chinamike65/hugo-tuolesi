**Introduction to Vajra Master Ngawang Gyatso**

Master Ngawang Gyatso was born on March 3, 1969 (the fifteenth day of the first lunar month) in Hainan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Qinghai Province.

The master began to practice Buddhism as a novice monk at the age of six, and became an ordained monk at the age of eighteen. He had studied with Dharma Master Lamaoyong Zeng, Geshe Rinpoche, Lobsang Dorje Vajra Guru, Gejia Rinpoche, Dharma Master Yeshe Gyatso, and Gazang Qusong Vajra Guru and the 10th Panchen Lama.

The master is like a teacher, and he has completely obtained the inheritance of the seven masters' hearts and methods, obtained more than 200 kinds of empowerment, more than 300 kinds of empowerment with Xu, more than 280 kinds of guidance, more than 500 scriptures and more than 80 kinds of transmissions and pith instructions.

The master followed Lamaoyong to increase the Dharma Master for more than 20 years and gained the experience of the Dharma Master throughout his life.

Lamaoyong enlarged the Dharma Master before expressing his silence and instructed the master: **"Your whole career in this life is to turn the wheel of Dharma widely and spread the Dharma for the benefit of all living beings."**

Master Ah Wang studied at Qinghai Buddhist Academy and Taer Monastery Debating School.

During Master Ngawang Gyatso's studies, he completed the five major treatises, the second and second esoteric courses of the five great vajras with extraordinary diligence and wisdom, and mastered all the contents.

Since graduating from Qinghai Buddhist Academy and Ta'er Monastery Debating Academy with excellent grades, the master has been living in Qinghai Tuole Monastery, serving as the Vajra Guru and the presiding officer of the monastery. He taught the monks of Tuole Monastery every day in groups of five great treatises, three ways of Dharmaism, and four tantras, and set up a new sutra debate school in the monastery.

Master Ah Wang has now produced several batches of lamas with a Geshe degree (equivalent to a Ph.D.) in Buddhism.

The master also insists on going into retreat for two months every year.

Master Ah Wang often gives sermons, teachings, precepts, and empowerment ceremonies in both Tibetan and Chinese areas, and often holds patriotic teachings, and patriotic activities in monasteries, making due contributions to the promotion of social harmony and stable development.

At the invitation of believers from other places, the master has traveled all over the world to teach the sutras and dharmas to those who are destined to hear them.

The guru is always compassionate and easily approachable, and speaks according to the occasion, and preaches the basic theories and simple practices of Buddhism, such as the Three Paths of Dharma, the Four Refuges, the Seven Branches of Offering, the Dharma of Amitabha Buddha, the Vajrasattva Ritual, and the [Heart Sutra](/english/heartsutranotes) of Prajna Paramita.

The master has tens of thousands of disciples of many different nationalities.

The master's writings include Commentary on Philosophy, Commentary on the Vajra Prajna Paramita Sutra, Dictation from the Three Masters of the Three Paths and Three Schools, Vajrasattva Ritual and Practice, and Dakini Buddha's Mother Ritual. Tracks and Practical Practices, Practice of Retreat, Simmering Sang Ritual, Biography of Vajra Guru Gazang Qusong, History of Tibetan Buddhism, Dabao Motto, Nectar Dharma Rain, Tantric Buddhism Feng Shui" and the "Dharma Ocean Treasures" series, etc.

The master's writings are concise and comprehensive, and the analysis is profound and thorough, and has been praised and acclaimed by many great scholars in Buddhist circles at home and abroad.

In recent years, believers from all over the world have made donations to Tuole Temple.

Since March 2006, in order to meet the needs of an increasing number of monks and laypeople to hear the Dharma, the master has continued to expand the infrastructure of Tuole Monastery, and presided over the construction of the Daxiong Hall, the Great Lecture Hall, the Upper and Lower Debating Courts, the Tibetan Sutra Pavilion, the residence of the Sangha, the eight stupas, the Dharma Protector Hall and other buildings.

In 2012, the Awa Temple was rebuilt at the request of Tibetan believers.

Today, in the pure land on earth at Tuole Monastery, the master gives the most profound Dharma teachings to devotees in the ten directions with the greatest diligence.

#### Characteristics of Buddhism

Buddhism has six characteristics: 

Harmonious Co-existence, 

Liberation, 

Cause and Effect, 

Cessation of Afflictions, 

Logic, 

and the Ultimate.

**1. Harmonious Co-existence**

There have been countless wars in human history, and there have been many wars caused by religious disputes, but there has been no war caused by Buddhism.

The compassion of Buddhism brings harmonious coexistence to human beings.

**2. Liberation**

Ordinary religions may promise that practitioners can go to heaven in their teachings, but they do not talk about complete liberation.

Buddhist practitioners can achieve liberation through practice.

The method of liberation from birth, old age, sickness and death is only available in Buddhism, not in any other religion.

**3. Cause and effect**

The teachings of most religions hold that the universe and everything that is characteristic of Buddhism was created by one Lord.

Buddhism teaches the theory of cause and effect, that is, whatever kind of cause you create, that kind of effect will be produced in return.

Good is rewarded with good, evil is rewarded with evil, and both suffering and happiness are the results of good and evil karma.

There is no savior, one's own destiny should be changed by oneself.

Stop worrying.

General religions advocate the good and the evil, but the methods for dealing with afflictions are incomplete.

**4. End of Suffering**

Learning Buddhism can bring an end to any troubles you may have.

**5. Use of Logic and Reasoning**

Other religions only talk about faith and not logic, while Buddhism talks about logic and truth.

The Buddha said: Bhikkhus or wise people should contemplate my words well, like refining, cutting and grinding gold.

**6. The Ultimate**

Any religion can use reasoning to some degree, but not the end. Buddhism is a knowledge of the ultimate, which is the biggest difference between Buddhism and other religions. The truth of what the Buddha said can help reach liberation.

Buddhism is a knowledge of the ultimate, which is the biggest difference between Buddhism and other religions.

The truth of what the Buddha said can come to an end. The basic laws of all things in the universe, the origin of life, and the incredible phenomena of cultural development have been fully explained, including social phenomena that cannot be explained by modern science, which are clearly expressed in Buddhist scriptures. In the practice stage, the ultimate liberation, the ultimate emptiness, the ultimate cause and effect, and the ultimate perfection all fully demonstrate that Buddhism is a science that can achieve ultimate perfection through practice and enlightenment.

#### Characteristics of Tibetan Buddhism

Tibetan Buddhism has five characteristics: 

Complete teaching

Complete inheritance

Complete practice

Complete preservation

Complete training curriculum

**1. Teaching is complete**

Buddha's teachings are divided into Theravada and Mahayana. Mahayana has both the sutra method and the tantra methods. Now there are three major schools of Buddhism, referring to Southern Buddhism, Chinese Buddhism and Tibetan Buddhism. Southern Buddhism is the method of Theravada, it does not have the method of Mahayana. Chinese Buddhism is still dominated by the Mahayana Buddhism, but it does not have the four continuations of Tantric Buddhism. The teachings of Tibetan Buddhism include the Theravada method, the Mahayana Sutra method, and the Mahayana Tantra method of perfection.

**2. The lineage is complete**

Except for the precepts, most of the traditions of Southern Buddhism and Chinese Buddhism have been cut off. However, the inheritance of the precepts, oral transmission, guidance, empowerment, etc. of Tibetan Buddhism has not been broken, and the lineage is pure and complete.

**3. The practice is complete**

Southern Buddhism cultivates the precepts for liberation and the thirty-seven paths. Chinese Buddhism cultivates the precepts of separation and liberation, the precepts of Bodhisattva, compassion, bodhicitta, and six degrees of perfection. Tibetan Buddhism practice is complete: the external practice of the Hinayana method, the internal practice of the Mahayana Sutra method and the Tantric practice of the four tantras, and the practice of the three vehicle precepts of Biejie, Bodhisattva and Tantric.

**4. Well preserved**

When Buddhism spread to Southeast Asian countries, all countries integrated their own local culture into Buddhism, and Buddhism was more or less influenced by local culture. When Buddhism entered China, Taoism and Confucian culture were very prosperous, so Han culture influenced Buddhism, and Buddhism became Han-style Buddhism. When Buddhism was introduced to Tibetan areas, there was no special culture formed in Tibet, so Tibetan culture was formed on the basis of mature Buddhism. Likewise, the Tibetan language is also formed on the basis of Sanskrit. Therefore, Tibetan Buddhism has preserved the original teachings of the Buddha of more than 2,500 years ago.

**5. The course is complete**

The courses of Buddhist study include sutras, tantras, and treatises. The small method and the sutra method taught by the Buddha himself are called sutras. The tantra method taught by the Buddha is called continuation.

The explanations of the sutras and tantras preached by the Buddhas, by Bodhisattvas and Mahasiddhas are called sutras. There are many Buddhists who study the scriptures directly in the Southern and Chinese Buddhism.

Tibetan Buddhism generally studies the sutras first, and then the tantras, because the content of the tantras is very deep and broad, it is easier to understand the content of the tantras after studying the sutras first.

Tibetan Buddhism mainly studies the Five Great Treatises, "The Broad Theory of the Bodhi Path", "The Broad Theory of the Tantric Path" and so on. A treatise contains a lot of sutras, and if you study a treatise well, you will also become familiar with a lot of sutras. Therefore, Tibetan Buddhism first studies the theories, then the scriptures, and then the continuations.

Tibetan Buddhism has the five perfections, pure lineage, and the complete sequence. At the same time, it integrates the essence of 84,000 methods, so it can cure the 84,000 kinds of troubles of modern people, and it is very suitable for contemporary lay people to practice.

Please arouse Bodhicitta and listen carefully!

The Four Refuges refer to taking refuge in the guru, taking refuge in the Buddha, taking refuge in the Dharma, and taking refuge in the Sangha. Among the 84,000 Dharma doors taught by Buddha Shakyamuni, the Four Refuges are the most important. 

Believers are Buddhist disciples after taking refuge in the Three Jewels, and they are not Buddhist disciples if they have not taken refuge. Although people who have not taken refuge can learn the wisdom of Buddhism, they may not be able to learn the complete Dharma. Why?

The reason is that there are many skillful, oral, and secret transmissions in the inheritance. Those who have not taken refuge have no lineage, and those who have not received the transmission cannot learn the complete Dharma.

The Four Refuges are about: the place of taking refuge, the cause of taking refuge, the merits of the Three Jewels, how to visualize, the merits of taking refuge, and the study of taking refuge.

1. A place of refuge

There are the guru and the three jewels of Buddha, Dharma and Sangha in the place of refuge.

(1) Guru

A guru is a teacher who teaches scriptures and Dharma, and a perfect guru is someone who possesses at least the following five virtues.

The five virtues are: Purity of Precepts, Perfect Understanding of Dharma, Great Compassion, Purity and Perfection of Tradition, and Understanding of Emptiness.

1. The precepts are pure

Those who have broken the precepts cannot become teachers. If the guru is a monk, the monk's two hundred and fifty-three precepts must be pure, and at least the four root precepts must be pure.

If you take the bodhisattva vows or the tantric vows, the bodhisattva vows and the tantric vows must also be purified.

The bodhisattva precepts have eighteen fundamental precepts and forty-six branch precepts, and the tantric precepts have fourteen fundamental precepts and eight branch precepts.

2. Fully understand the Dharma

If you only understand Sutra and don't understand Tantra, you will slander Tantra; if you only understand Tantra but don't understand Sutra, you will slander Sutra.

Not understanding the Dharma, and slandering the Dharma is a great sin.

Such a teacher cannot lead his disciples to the right path, so the teacher must be proficient in 84,000 kinds of dharmas, and must have a very complete understanding of the sutras.

3. Great mercy and great compassion

The master treats every disciple with the same love as parents treat their only child, and loves every sentient being, and has a great wish to let sentient beings in the six realms be free from suffering and the causes of suffering.

4. Inheritance is pure and complete

Before the Tang Dynasty, both Xianzong and Tantric Buddhism were inherited.

After the Tang Dynasty, the inheritance is still continuing is Tantra.

The Four Refugees we are learning today were first passed on from Shakyamuni Buddha to Manjushri, then to Nagarjuna, then to Yuecheng Bodhisattva, then to Venerable Atisha, and then to Tsongkhapa Master, it was passed on to Kezhujie, the eldest disciple of Master Tsongkhapa, then to Dharma King Rako Rinpoche, then to Dharma King Yongzin, and then to Guru Ngawang Gyatso Vajrayana (the seventh master of Ngawang). The teachers are all disciples of Rako Rinpoche).

Tantric traditions include empowerment, oral transmission, guidance, precepts, and so on.

What is lineage purity or impurity? If we disobey the guru, the lineage will be impure; the faith in the guru will remain intact, and the lineage will be pure.

5. Understanding Emptiness

The guru does not necessarily have the realization of emptiness, but he must be able to understand true emptiness in words.

A guru who possesses the five virtues is the guru we take refuge in.

（(2) Buddha

A Buddha is a person who has cut off the two obstacles, the purest body, speech, and mind, a person who is fully enlightened and omniscient, a person who has obtained the four perfect bodies, and a person with the most complete blessings and wisdom. The Buddha understands all suffering and the causes of suffering, understands the sufferings and afflictions of sentient beings in the six realms, and understands the methods to resolve them.

The Buddhas mentioned by the Xianzong refer to the Buddhas of the ten directions and three times, such as Shakyamuni Buddha and Amitabha Buddha.

The Buddha mentioned in Tantra includes four deities: the deity of the affairs department, such as the five-nature Manjushri, the thousand-hand Guanyin, the twenty-one Tara, etc.; the deity of the line of action, such as Vairocana Bodhi Buddha, etc.; the deity of the yoga department, such as the Great Sun Tathagata etc.; Supreme Yoga Deity, such as Mahavira, Kalachakra, etc.

Buddha includes all the Buddhas, both manifest and secret.

(3) Law

Dhamma refers to teaching and proof.

The teachings refer to eighty-four thousand teachings.

There are 84,000 kinds of afflictions in human beings, and there are 84,000 kinds of methods for dealing with afflictions.

Therefore, the more you learn the Dharma, the better, and the more you can deal with people's troubles.

The realization of the Dharma refers to the enlightenment that practitioners should have, such as precepts, concentration, wisdom, and the five paths.

There are Mahayana and Hinayana.

Mahayana has explicit and secret methods.

The Hinayana refers to the Southern Tradition, and there is no Mahayana manifest or esoteric method.

The Han traditions are mainly Xian Zong, and there are also some esoteric methods.

There are eight major sects of Chinese Buddhism: Lu Sect, Pure Land Sect, Consciousness-only Sect, San Lun Sect, Huayan Sect, Zen Sect, Tiantai Sect, and Tantric Sect.

Tibetan tradition is a combination of explicit and secret.

Tibetan Buddhism has four major schools and eighteen small schools.

The four major schools are Nyingma, Kagyu, Sakya, and Gelug.

The characteristics of tantra are the external practice of the Hinayana, including the precepts of other liberation; the internal cultivation of bodhicitta, the six degrees of ten thousand actions, and the bodhisattva precepts; the four deities of the tantric practice, especially the second stage of the supreme yoga.

Tibetan Buddhism is combined with Mahayana and Buddhism.

Dharma is these Dharma gates.

(4) Monk

Both those who realize emptiness and the devas who realize emptiness are monks.

The Hinayana monks have four fruit positions, including Arahants.

The monks of the Mahayana Buddhism are bodhisattvas from one place to ten places.

Tantric monks are Bodhisattvas, Dakinis, Dakinis, warriors, warrior mothers, and transcendent Dharma protectors.

Four ordinary monks can represent monks, but they are not monks in the true sense.

The contents of the Four Refugees are very extensive, and even a great Geshe (Doctor of Buddhism) would not dare to say that he fully understands the Four Refugees.

The reason for taking refuge

(1) Believe in the Three Jewels and understand the merits of the Three Jewels.

(2) The lower rank is afraid of suffering and the suffering of the three evil realms; the middle rank is afraid that he will suffer from the six realms of reincarnation; the upper rank is afraid of the suffering of all beings in the six realms.

Four Refuges Why should we take refuge? What kind of attitude do you take refuge in? For liberation, in order to become a Buddha and save sentient beings, for health, for the sake of success in doing things, it is possible to take refuge for any purpose. There are thousands of reasons for taking refuge.

The real refuge: the lower clerical way is for the next life to have the leisure and perfection of the seven virtues of human beings and heaven, and not to fall into the three evil realms; the middle clerical way is for liberation; the upper clerical way is to become a Buddha.

3. The merits of the Three Treasures

The merits of the Three Jewels are: Buddha's merit, Dharma's merit, and Sangha's merit.

(1) Buddha's merits Buddha's merits include the merits of body, speech, mind, and karma.

1. The merits of the Buddha's body

The Buddha's body has thirty-two features and eighty sublime features, that is, thirty-two features such as "the wheel of the hands and feet, and the soles of the feet are like the belly of a turtle", and eighty features such as the "bronze color of the Buddha's claws".

The praise of the Buddha's merits recorded in "Yuzan": "The appearance is dignified and dignified, and the eyes are particularly wonderful, like the autumn sky without clouds, and the stars are solemn.

Nengren is golden in color, and the dharma robes are strictly covered, which is equivalent to the golden mountain top, bound by the clouds.

Respected parents without strict ornaments, the face wheel full of aurora, Li Yun full moon wheel, and no one can match him.

The wonderful lotus in the mouth is the same as the lotus in the sun, when the bee sees doubts, it should be turned like a hanging rope.

Zun's mask is golden, and the white teeth are sharp, like the pure autumn moonlight, shining into the golden mountain gap.

The right hand should be offered, decorated with a special wheel, soothing with the hand, and the fear of life and death.

When Nengren marches, his feet are like wonderful lotuses, printing and painting this ground, how can the lotus garden be beautiful? "

2. Buddha's speech merits

There are sixty-four virtues of the Buddha's speech. When the Buddha taught the scriptures, different people asked different questions, and the Buddha could answer all the questions with just one "ah" character.

He never tires of listening to the Dharma taught by the Buddha, and every time he listens to it, he gains incredible results.

People in different countries speak different languages, and one word "ah" can be translated into various languages.

As it is said in "Puxian Xingxiangpin": "Heavenly Dragon Yaksha Kupanta, even human beings and non-human beings, all the speeches of all living beings can be spoken with various sounds.

"And it is said in the tantra: "Although there is one voice, there are many appearances. "

Master Tsongkhapa said: "All sentient beings in all the worlds ask all doubts at one time, do everything in front of each one, and appear solemn in body and speech at the same time, even though they are engaged in work and rest.

It means that disciples who continue to study Buddhism day and night and listen to the sutras are very happy. Every time, they can solve the doubts in their hearts, and there are more and more ways to cut off their troubles.

When the Buddha preached the scriptures, the Buddha's voice could be heard clearly no matter in the front row or the back row.

In the past, Rinpoche Xingsa went to Kham to initiate Kalachakra. A deaf-mute person also participated. Suddenly, the deaf-mute person could hear the voice of Master's sermons, and he could also speak. He was very happy.

The next day he wanted to hear more clearly and sat in front of him, but it was exactly the same sound he heard the first day.

It can be seen that the Buddha's words are very powerful.

As for the merits of other speeches, it is said in the "Hundred and Fifty Praises": "Contemplating the deity's lovely face, from what he has heard, it is extremely harmonious and elegant, like the moon's nectar.

Reverence can be quiet, greed is like a rain cloud.

Pulling out the venomous snake is equivalent to the wonderful winged bird.

Destroying extreme ignorance, the obscurity is like the sun, and by destroying my slow mountain, it is also like a diamond.

See righteousness so there is no deception, no fault so follow along, good affixation so it is easy to understand, respectful words and good sayings.

The first time you hear the words of the Venerable, you can capture the mind of the hearer, and the second is right thinking, and it also eliminates all greed and delusion.

To congratulate all lacks, to return to all indulgences, to disgust those who are happy, and to reverence and speak commensurately.

Those who can produce wisdom rejoice, those who can increase the wisdom of the middle, and those who can destroy the shadows, these words benefit all living beings. "

3. Buddha's Intentional Merit

Referring to the major scriptures, the merits of the Buddha's mind include: the ten powers of the Buddha, the eighteen uncommon dharmas, and the twenty-one kinds of merits of the infallible wisdom.

Intentional merit can be divided into two types: "wisdom merit" and "compassion merit".

Wisdom and merit, the Buddha can see all dharmas clearly when he enters the time.

Such as watching the ummara fruit in the hands.

It is said in "Zan Ying Zan": "The World-Honored One falls into the law of the time, all kinds of seeds are born, like the sour fruit in the palm of the hand, which is the state of the mind.

All dharmas are moving and not moving, if they are one or more, they are like the wind in the sky, and there is nothing to hinder the respect.

"Compassion and merit, Buddha's love for sentient beings in the six realms is countless times greater than a mother's love for her seriously ill child.

No matter how deeply we cherish ourselves, it cannot be compared to a fraction of the Buddha's compassion for every sentient being.

Moreover, the compassion of the Buddha is different from our compassion, which sometimes increases and sometimes decreases.

Because the Buddha always saw all sentient beings suffering, his great compassion never ceased.

4. The merits of the Buddha's career

The Buddha has great compassion, great power, and great wisdom.

The Buddha knows what kind of suffering sentient beings have. This is the wisdom of the Buddha.

Buddha has the ability and compassion to save all sentient beings.

As long as the cause and condition for saving sentient beings arrives, the Buddha will surely save sentient beings without delay.

(2) Dharma merits

Dharma is the way to get rid of suffering and gain happiness. The virtue of Dharma is to free all beings from suffering, to realize their true nature, and to cut off afflictions.

When we do things with a balanced state of mind, we will not be so impatient, we will endure humiliation and tolerance, and we know that to tolerate others is to tolerate ourselves.

(3) The merits of the Sangha

Sangha include Bodhisattvas, Arahants, and Dharma protectors.

1. The merits of the Bodhisattva

The Bodhisattva of the First Land cut off the obstacles of discriminating afflictions and knowledge, realized emptiness, and obtained the five supernatural powers.

After leaving the concentration, there are twelve merits: in an instant, you can see a hundred Buddhas; you can get the blessing of a hundred Buddhas; you can reach a hundred pure lands; you can manifest a hundred pure lands; you can shake a hundred worlds; you can live One hundred kalpas; able to know things before and after one hundred kalpas; able to enter one hundred meditations; able to teach one hundred Dharma doors; able to save one hundred sentient beings; able to transform one hundred incarnations; capable of incarnating one for each incarnation Hundreds of relatives.

Every time a Bodhisattva enters a land, his merit increases tenfold compared to the previous Bodhisattva.

For example, a bodhisattva in two places can see a thousand buddhas in a moment, a bodhisattva in three places can see 10,000 Buddhas in a moment, a bodhisattva in four places can see a hundred thousand buddhas in a moment, a bodhisattva in five places can see a million buddhas in a moment, and a bodhisattva in six places can see a million buddhas in a moment. You can see thousands of buddhas in an instant, a bodhisattva in the seventh place can see 100 million buddhas in an instant, a bodhisattva in the eighth can see a billion buddhas in a moment, a bodhisattva in the ninth place can see 10 billion buddhas in a moment, and a bodhisattva in the tenth place can see hundreds of billions in an instant Respect the Buddha.

The same goes for the growth of other merits.

There are nine grades of inborn afflictions, and nine grades of inborn knowledge obstacles.

Big troubles have big, medium and small pieces, medium troubles have medium big, medium and small pieces, and small troubles have small big, medium and small pieces.

The same is true of the obstacles to the knowledge of the Four Refugees.

The bodhisattvas of the second ground cut off the great afflictions and the hindrances of knowledge, the bodhisattvas of the third ground cut off the great afflictions and the hindrances of the knowledge, the bodhisattvas of the fourth ground cut off the great and small afflictions and the hindrances of the knowledge, and the bodhisattvas of the fifth ground cut off the great afflictions and the hindrances of the knowledge. The bodhisattvas of the sixth ground cut off the hindrances of middle afflictions and the hindrances of knowledge, the bodhisattvas of the seventh ground cut off the hindrances of medium and small afflictions and the hindrances of knowledge, the bodhisattvas of the eighth ground cut off the hindrances of small and great afflictions and the hindrances of knowledge, and the bodhisattvas of the nine grounds cut off the hindrances of small and medium afflictions and hindrances of knowledge. , The Bodhisattvas of the Ten Grounds cut off the obstacles of small afflictions and obstacles of knowledge.

2. The merits of an arahant

Arahants cut off the obstacles of afflictions and obtained the five supernatural powers and various meditations.

Arahants have the compassion of a mother to all beings, but not the compassion of a father (taking the responsibility of leading all beings from suffering to happiness).

An arahant has the wisdom of a bodhisattva of the seven grounds, but has no bodhicitta.

3. The virtues of the supernatural guardian deity

The transcendent Dharma protector can do things to increase the sustenance, protect the Dharma and practitioners.

(Retire, quench disaster; increase, increase merit; embrace, love all beings; slaughter, slaughter demons.

)

4. How to visualize

Visualize an eight-petaled lotus flower on the head, and in the middle of the lotus is Sakyamuni Buddha meditating. His heart glows with white light, and he invites the guru to the Three Jewels (the guru includes the root guru and the lineage guru), and invites all the Buddhas and Tathagatas. Bodhisattvas, warriors and warrior mothers merged into Shakyamuni Buddha.

The rituals of viewing the grain field are:

There is no difference between happiness and emptiness. In the vast emptiness, Samantabhadra makes offerings to the sea of ​​clouds.

The branches, leaves, flowers and fruits are beautiful and solemn, and the top of the tree is full of wishful wishes.

Eight snow lions hold the great throne, lotus flowers, sun and moon form the mattress,

Possessing the root guru of the three kindnesses, all Buddhas are the essence.

Now the monks are dressed in cassocks, with a smile on one side and two arms,

The right hand speaks, the left hand seals the seal, the bowl is filled with nectar,

He was dressed in three garments of tulip, with a golden hat on top.

The heart is capable of Rinjing Vajra holding the king, one face and two arms are blue,

Holding a bell and pestle, embracing the princess of the realm, benefiting from the innate wisdom of music and emptiness,

All kinds of treasures are regarded as decorations, and the variegated clothes are very strict.

The four refuges are so solemn and bright, surrounded by five-colored clouds.

Foot-knotted Vajra squat posture, the five aggregates are pure, they are the five Buddhas,

The purity of the four worlds is the four bright concubines, all the bodhisattvas in all places,

Twenty-one thousand Arhats with pores, all branches and branches are King Ming,

The light is the secret trace of the fork that protects the prescription and the medicine, and all the people in the world are the foot pads.

Zhou Za personally shuns all teachers and teachers, all the gods in the altar of the deity,

All Buddhas, Bodhisattvas, warriors, dakas, surrounded by a sea of ​​Dharma protectors.

Each of the three gates and three vajra images, the hum character shines like a hook,

From the nature, please invite the wise deity, and the harmony will be stable and stable.

May all sentient beings be a great supporter and destroy the demon army and its retinue, the heavens,

Knowing that everything is complete, the World-Honored One comes here with his family.

Zha, Hung, Wan, Ha, are indistinguishable from the samaya.

After viewing the grain fields, recite the Four Refugees. There are four refuges in Sanskrit, Tibetan, and Chinese, and the four refuges in Sanskrit are mainly recited.

Recite the Four Refugees.

While reciting, visualize the nectar water pouring down from the body of Buddha Sakyamuni. From the outside to the inside, the whole body and mind are washed clean by the nectar water. Small animals such as snakes and frogs are washed with nectar water and flow out from the pores of the body, and all diseases and demons are excreted from the body.

It is the most extraordinary to contemplate while reciting. You can also visualize first and then recite, or you can recite first and then visualize.

After reciting the Four Refugees, the Buddha on the head becomes smaller and smaller. From the top of the head along the red central vein in the middle of the body, it merges into the heart chakra. Visualize that your fleshy heart has become an eight-petal lotus, and the Buddha is in the eight-petal lotus. Close up and slowly stop in your heart.

The Buddha is always in the heart, that is, there is a Buddha in the heart, and there is no difference between the master, the Buddha, and one's own heart.

Taking refuge in the Buddha in your heart is the Three Jewels of the Guru. The Guru is also integrated into the body, and the Dharma and the Bodhisattva are also integrated into the body.

There are different kinds of refuge states. This kind of visualization is the simplest, and those with strong visualization ability can visualize the most extensive refuge state.

In order to make offerings to all Buddhas and Bodhisattvas, one should recite "Om Ah Hum" three times.

After reciting it three times, make offerings to the guru's Three Jewels.

"Om Ah Hum" is the seed mantra of all Buddhas and Tathagatas. When reciting the first time, all the unclean things are purified. When reciting the second time, all the offerings become nectar. When reciting the third time, the offerings become countless offerings. , make offerings to the Buddha in the heart.

This is relatively easy to do. In life, we use our eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, and mind to make offerings to the Buddha in our hearts.

Seeing good things with the eyes, hearing good music with the ears, smelling good fragrances with the nose, tasting good tastes with the tongue, etc., are all offered to the Guru Triple Gem in the heart.

Eating a meal to make offerings to the Three Jewels, and taking a bath can also bathe the Buddha in your heart, all of which can increase blessings.

5. The merits of taking refuge

Not falling into the three evil paths, eliminating karmic obstacles, accumulating blessings, obtaining the blessings of the Three Jewels, exorcising demons, not being obstructed by foreign magic, and able to break through obstacles.

6. Refuge School

Guru Yoga Guru Yoga

Everyone please listen to the bodhicitta!

Today we are going to talk about Guru Yoga.

There is a forward practice in Tantra. First, you must recite the Four Refugees 100,000 times, then recite the Guru Yoga 100,000 times, then make the Mantra 100,000 times, and then practice the Vajrasattva 100,000 times.

The four preliminaries, plus the prostration 100,000 times is the five preliminaries, plus one hundred thousand times around the pagoda, the six preliminaries, plus the offering of 100,000 cups of water, the seventh preliminaries, and the 100,000 elimination of karma The fire offering (Vajra emptiness fire offering), the eight additions, plus the printing of 100,000 Buddha statues, the nine additions, plus the offering of 100,000 lamps, is called the ten additions.

If you can practice the ten plus actions, you will have a firmer foundation for practicing the Dharma.

Usually it is very important to practice four additional lines.

Guru Yoga is the most important one in the forward movement, and this forward movement is very important.

Guru Yoga means the visualization that the Guru and the Buddha are indistinguishable.

There are several aspects to be understood in the practice of Guru Yoga: the guru, the invitation to Tsongkhapa, the seven-branch offering method, the prayer of Tsongkhapa, integration, and praise.

1. Guru

The masters mentioned here include Mahayana masters and Tsongkhapa masters.

(1) Mahayana Guru

First of all, you need to understand what a guru is.

A guru is a teacher who preaches the scriptures and spreads the Fa.

A Mahayana teacher must not only be able to teach scriptures and teach the Dharma, but must also meet ten conditions.

A tantric guru must add twenty virtue signs to the ten conditions.

Twenty signs of virtue are ten signs of virtue inside and ten signs of virtue outside.

There are five minimum requirements for being a guru:

1. The precepts are pure

If the guru is a monk, all the monks' precepts must be pure.

Tibetan Buddhist monks have 253 precepts, and these precepts must be pure.

Unlike Southern Buddhism, monks in Southern Buddhism have 227 precepts.

The inheritance is different, and the precepts are also different.

The precepts can be divided into three types: the precepts of no liberation, the precepts of bodhisattvas, and the precepts of tantra.

The precepts for not liberation include five precepts at home and eight fastings at home.

There are three kinds of those who belong to the home, and five kinds of those that belong to the monks.

The monks' precepts, the monk's precepts, the novice precepts, the novice precepts, and the study precepts are the five precepts for renunciation.

If the master is a monk, the monk's precepts must be pure.

If you have received the Bodhisattva Precepts, the Bodhisattva Precepts must be pure.

If you have already received the tantric vows, the tantric vows must be pure.

If you have broken the precepts, you cannot become a guru, and you cannot become a guru if you have not received the precepts, because he does not have the first condition.

2. To fully understand the Dharma

Dharma is divided into Hinayana and Mahayana.

Mahayana is divided into sutra and tantric methods.

As a guru, the Theravada, Mahayana, Sutra, and Tantra methods must be fully understood, and 84,000 types of methods must be mastered.

If you are only proficient in one, or if you are only proficient in the small method but not in the Mahayana, you are not called a guru. The guru must be proficient in 84,000 methods.

The study of Tibetan Buddhism is done by debating the scriptures. Usually, the Dharma of the Mahayana Buddhism and the Dharma of Theravada are studied first. These Dharmas take 16 years to study, and at least 11 or 12 years.

After finishing these studies, I will study Tantra. The four sutras of Tantra need to be studied for seven or eight years, and they should be studied by means of debating the scriptures. , Esoteric Four Continuations.

Mastering the five great treatises and the four tantras is equivalent to learning 84,000 dharmas.

This is the second condition of being a guru.

3. Great mercy and great compassion

Everyone is equal in front of the master. The master loves every disciple, loves every sentient being, and must be so compassionate and compassionate.

This is the third condition of being a guru.

4. There is a complete and pure inheritance

Buddhism now includes Tibetan Buddhism, Chinese Buddhism, and Southern Buddhism.

All the inheritances of Tibetan Buddhism in these three sects have been preserved relatively intact from the Buddha Shakyamuni to the present, and the inheritance has not been broken.

Every scripture has a lineage, a lineage of empowerment, a lineage of sermons, and a lineage of oral transmission.

With the inheritance, you can get the blessings of the Dharma, and there will be no misunderstandings.

Inheritance is very important, for example: Fa is a mobile phone, inheritance is a signal, inheritance is a very important condition.

Among the three major sects, many of the inheritance of Chinese Buddhism has now been cut off, as has Southern Buddhism.

But the inheritance of Tibetan Buddhism has never been broken, and the inheritance is very complete.

Our lineage is the lineage of the Gelug Sect of the Yellow Sect. It was the forty-fifth generation from Buddha Shakyamuni to my master, and the forty-sixth generation to me.

The algorithm of each inheritance is different. For example, the inheritance of some scriptures has reached more than 80 generations, and there are also more than 90 generations.

The inheritance of the Prajna Sutra is now the forty-sixth generation.

The Prajna Sutra has only been passed down from generation to generation for forty-six generations, and other inheritances have reached more than 90 generations, or even more than 100 generations.

Why is there such a big difference? Nagarjuna Bodhisattva, the inheritor of the Prajna Sutra, lived for 600 years, and Yuecheng Bodhisattva lived for 356 years.

Since there are many masters who have lived for hundreds of years, the inheritance of the Prajna Sutra has only reached forty-six generations.

Lineage masters such as Nagarjuna have lived to be hundreds of years old. Because of this origin, people who study Madhyamika generally live longer.

This is the fourth one as a guru??

5. Understanding Emptiness

The guru does not necessarily realize emptiness, but at least he can understand emptiness in words.

If the guru does not understand emptiness, he cannot lead the disciple on the path of liberation, because emptiness is the root of liberation.

This is the fifth condition of being a guru.

Only those who meet these five conditions can be called a guru.

Taking refuge in such a teacher can receive the blessings of the Buddhas and Tathagatas.

When practicing Guru Yoga, both the guru and the Buddha must visualize indistinguishably in order to receive blessings.

If you visualize the master and the Buddha indistinguishably, you can get the blessings of the Buddhas and Tathagatas; visualize the guru and the Arahants as if they are indistinguishable, and you can get the blessings of the Arahants; visualize the teacher as an ordinary person and gain nothing. Blessing, because ordinary ordinary people do not have the blessing power.

The strength of the guru's blessing depends on the confidence of the disciple. How confident the disciple is, the greater the blessing of the guru.

The disciple regards the guru as the Buddhas and Tathagatas, and if they have this confidence, they can obtain the blessings of the Buddhas and Tathagatas.

The guru can be an ordinary person, or the guru can be an ordinary person.

Whether the guru is a Buddha or not is unimportant, but confidence in the guru is the most important thing. The belief that a guru and a Buddha are indistinguishable is very important.

Tantric practice can instantly become a Buddha.

There are many convenient ways to become a Buddha, and guru yoga is the most excellent one among the many convenient ways.

From the point of view of the sutras, a person must at least have the blessings of three asamkhya kalpas when he becomes a Buddha.

A kalpa has 12.9 billion years.

If we can truly practice Guru Yoga, it will be easy to accumulate blessings, eliminate karmic obstacles, and more easily obtain the blessings of the Buddhas and Tathagatas.

The blessings of the Buddhas and Tathagatas are as vast and ubiquitous as the sun's rays. Our troubles are like garbage everywhere. The blessing of the master is like the light of a magnifying glass. It is easy to burn the troubled garbage with the light of the magnifying glass. burn.

We first concentrate the blessings of the Buddhas and Tathagatas on the body, speech and mind of the guru, and then the guru's blessings and the blessings of the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas give us blessings. This blessing can cut off our troubles and eliminate our worries. karma and suffering.

What is blessing? The energy of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas is called blessing.

This energy can change our life, it can cut off our troubles, it can eliminate our pain.

Whether you can get the blessings of the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas depends on whether you have practiced Guru Yoga.

Guru Yoga varies from school to school.

Guru Yoga is a very special method unique to Tantric Buddhism. The three major sects of Sutra and Theravada do not have Guru Yoga, but only Tibetan Buddhism.

Guru Yoga of the Nyingma School of Tibetan Buddhism is the visualization that Guru Rinpoche is indistinguishable from his own Guru.

The Kagyu sect also has guru yoga, where the Vajrapani or Marpa masters are no different from their own masters.

Guru Yoga of the Gelugpa is a visualization that Tsongkhapa is indistinguishable from his root guru.

To understand Guru Yoga of Gelugpa, we must first understand what kind of person Tsongkhapa is.

(2) Master Tsongkhapa

Master Tsongkhapa is the founder of the Gelug School, and many Buddhist scriptures have recorded Master Tsongkhapa.

When Buddha Shakyamuni was about to pass away, Manjushri Bodhisattva bowed to Buddha Shakyamuni three times and asked, "Buddha Shakyamuni, you have passed away, who will carry forward the Mahayana Dharma that will be cultivated in the future?" Sakyamuni The Buddha said: "Manjushri's true body and the incarnation of all Buddhas and Tathagatas, Tsongkhapa, have come to promote the Dharma door of Xianxian and Tantric practice."

Master Tsongkhapa was called the second Buddha when he was prophesied by the Buddha.

Many masters have also been prophesied. For example, when Nagarjuna Bodhisattva was prophesied, he said that he was an invincible guru. When Wusang Bodhisattva was prophesied, he said that he was the most excellent guru who taught knowledge-only. Only Master Tsongkhapa was predicted in the name of the two Buddhas.

Buddha Shakyamuni had different prophecies to Master Tsongkhapa.

Sometimes it is said to be the incarnation of Sakyamuni Buddha himself, sometimes it is said to be the incarnation of Manjushri, sometimes it is said to be the incarnation of Guanyin Bodhisattva, sometimes it is said to be the incarnation of Maitreya Bodhisattva, and sometimes it is said that it is the second coming of Vajra Hand Bodhisattva. Sometimes it is said that Amitabha has returned, and there are so many different prophecies.

These statements are not contradictory, because Master Tsongkhapa is the incarnation of all Buddhas and Tathagatas.

There are only four incarnations of the Buddhas and Tathagatas: Master Tsongkhapa is the incarnation of the Buddhas and Tathagatas, Guanyin is the incarnation of the compassion of the Buddhas and Tathagatas, Manjushri is the incarnation of the wisdom of the Buddhas and Tathagatas, and the Vajra Hand is the incarnation of the abilities of the Buddhas and Tathagatas.

Is Buddha Shakyamuni the incarnation of Buddhas and Tathagatas? no.

Shakyamuni Buddha was an ordinary person who became a Buddha through cultivation.

Amitabha Buddha is also an ordinary person who cultivated his heart and became a Buddha.

Tsongkhapa, Avalokitesvara, Manjusri, and Vajra Hand are different. These four are the incarnations of all Buddhas and Tathagatas.

Padmasambhava also predicted Tsongkhapa.

Guru Rinpoche said: My incarnation Tsongkhapa appeared.

Master Tsongkhapa is the incarnation of Guru Rinpoche himself.

When Majila was about to prophesy Master Tsongkhapa, Majila asked all his disciples to come over and said: Tsongkhapa will be born in the Amdo area. Tsongkhapa is the incarnation of all Buddhas and Tathagatas. You all vow that in the future To be a disciple of Tsongkhapa, to be a disciple of Tsongkhapa is to be a disciple of all Buddhas and Tathagatas, to practice Tsongkhapa’s Dharma door is to cultivate all Buddhas and Tathagatas’ Dharma doors, to make offerings to Tsongkhapa is to make offerings to all Buddhas and Tathagatas, so You all make a vow to be Tsongkhapa's disciples.

All the disciples of Majilazhun vowed to be the disciples of Master Tsongkhapa. When Master Tsongkhapa taught the scriptures and preached the Fa, many disciples came back from the disciples of Majilazhun.

The same is true for Nagarjuna Bodhisattva and Yuecheng Bodhisattva.

Before Nagarjuna Bodhisattva passed away, let the disciples come and tell them that in the future, the incarnation of Manjushri Bodhisattva Tsongkhapa will be born, and Tsongkhapa will carry forward the Dharma of Xian and Mistress, and make them vow to be Tsongkhapa's disciples and Tsongkhapa's disciples. You can become a Buddha instantly.

The eldest disciple of Nagarjuna Bodhisattva, Yuecheng Bodhisattva, also vowed to be a disciple of Master Tsongkhapa.

The eldest disciple of Master Tsongkhapa, Kezhujie, is the second coming of the Bodhisattva Yuecheng.

Many practitioners know that there are not only one or two lines of Tsongkhapa in the Buddhist scriptures, nor just one or two sutras.

Therefore, before the birth of Master Tsongkhapa, the previous masters all wanted to see Master Tsongkhapa, and they all vowed to be disciples of Master Tsongkhapa.

Every time Master Tsongkhapa talks about emptiness or Madhyamika, there are thousands of eminent monks listening, and there are hundreds who realize emptiness after listening, which is very extraordinary.

Before the birth of Master Tsongkhapa, there was a master named Lobsang Drakpa, who was the most accomplished master in Ali, Tibet at that time.

He said: I am now using the Kalachakra calendar to calculate that Tsongkhapa will be born soon.

So he sent his eldest disciple, Dongzhi Rinchen, to the Amdo area and told him: Dongzhi Rinchen, you go to Amdo, and Tsongkhapa, the incarnation of Manjushri, will be born soon.

After he was born, you gave him my legal name, Lobsang Drakpa.

Now that I am old and unable to walk, my greatest wish in life is to give this name to Tsongkhapa.

Then Dongzhi Rinchen went from Lhasa to Amdo (now Quge Mountain near the Ta'er Monastery) and retreated.

After a period of retreat, Master Tsongkhapa was really born.

It was when he was in retreat one morning to cultivate the great mighty virtue, and the great mighty virtue appeared to him and said, "I am going to be born today, you come and visit me.

"On that day, Master Tsongkhapa was born.

When Master Tsongkhapa was born, as soon as he was born, the umbilical cord was cut, and a sandalwood tree grew where a drop of blood fell.

This sandalwood tree has 100,000 leaves, and each leaf has a Buddha.

Only Master Tsongkhapa has this kind of auspicious appearance, and no other great siddhis have it.

This is one of the eighteen unique characteristics of Master Tsongkhapa, and it is also one of the most extraordinary auspicious signs.

After the birth of Master Tsongkhapa, Dongzhi Rinchen gave him the Dharma name "Lobsang Drakpa". He received the five precepts at the age of three, became a monk at the age of seven, studied various scriptures, and went to Lhasa in Tibet at the age of sixteen.

At that time, there were many sects in Lhasa, such as Sakya, Nyingma, Kagyu, Kadam, Joonang and so on.

Master Tsongkhapa learned the Dharma of various schools, and worshipped more than forty masters who were very distinguished in each school at that time.

Learned all the methods of Nyingma from the master of Nyingma.

Learned all the methods of the Kagyu sect with the teachers of the Kagyu sect.

Learned all the methods of each sect from the masters of the Sakya, Kadam, Joonang and other sects.

After learning it well, Master Tsongkhapa studied these dharmas, and combined the purest, most complete inheritance, the most noble, and the most essence of the sects to create a sect - the Gelug Sect of the Yellow Sect.

The Gelug Sect of the Yellow Sect has all the methods of other sects, but some of the Gelug sects of the Yellow Sect may not have other sects, such as the thirteen Dawei De Dharmamen, Dawei De personally empowered Tsongkhapa, this Dharma door is only Gelug The sect has it, the other sects don't.

Before Master Tsongkhapa founded the Gelug Sect, practitioners in Tibetan areas were more chaotic in terms of precepts, and there were many practitioners who did not observe precepts or who were not pure.

Master Tsongkhapa made a great vow: No matter whether a practitioner is a monk or a monk, the precepts must be pure.

At the same time, a lot of effort has been put into the discipline, so the disciplines of the Gelug Sect disciples are relatively pure.

In the past, the study of the five major theories and the study of the scriptures were carried out by the Sakya and Kadam schools, but gradually the Sakya school itself did not have this method, and later it became the method of the Gelug school.

Now all the sects who want to study the debating of scriptures go to the monasteries of the Gelug sect to study.

Master Tsongkhapa is very special and perfect in terms of vows, learning, discipline, and right view.

Therefore, when the Fifth Dalai Lama talked about the merits of Master Tsongkhapa, he said that the achievements of all the great siddhas in our Tibetan area in all aspects can be compared to Master Tsongkhapa, and the achievements of any individual are not as good as that of Tsongkhapa. Master Kaba.

For example, some people are not as good as Master Tsongkhapa in precepts, some people are not as good as Master Tsongkhapa in teaching scriptures and teachings, some people are not as good as Master Tsongkhapa in debating scriptures, some people are not as good as Master Tsongkhapa in terms of writings, and some people are not as good as Master Tsongkhapa. Not as good as Master Tsongkhapa.

Even the very noble and accomplished master Marpa is not as good as Master Tsongkhapa.

Because, first, the precepts are not as good as Master Tsongkhapa.

Master Marpa has five precepts at home, and Master Tsongkhapa is a monk. Second, the inheritance is not as good as that of Master Tsongkhapa.

Master Tsongkhapa has various lineages.

Master Tsongkhapa received the entire lineage of Guru Marpa, as well as the lineage of many other schools, such as the Sakya and Nyingma schools.

Master Tsongkhapa has the lineage that Guru Marpa does not have.

This time when we talk about Master Tsongkhapa's guru yoga, we must visualize that Master Tsongkhapa is indistinguishable from his guru, so that we can not only receive the blessing of Master Tsongkhapa, but also the blessings of the Buddhas and Tathagatas.

Reciting the prayers of Master Tsongkhapa means reciting the prayers of the Buddhas and Tathagatas, because Master Tsongkhapa is the incarnation of the Buddhas and Tathagatas.

Reciting the mantra of Master Tsongkhapa means reciting the mantra of the four deities, because Master Tsongkhapa is the incarnation of the four deities.

After Master Tsongkhapa passed away, there were many incarnations. There are five recognized incarnations: one incarnates in the Land of Ultimate Bliss; one incarnates in the Pure Land of Dakini; On the pure land of great mighty virtue; an incarnation on the pure land of Manjushri.

When we do Tsongkhapa's guru yoga now, we pray to one of these five incarnations.

Which one is the easiest to get? The incarnation of Master Tsongkhapa in the Tusita Tian Maitreya Institute is the easiest for us to ask for.

What method should I use to invite? First of all, visualize the Tusita Heaven in the distant sky, visualize Maitreya Maitreya’s Pure Land in the Tusita Heaven, and visualize Maitreya Buddha in the Maitreya Academy. Maitreya Buddha is like sitting on a sofa. Sitting there like the above is called the sitting method of growth.

Maitreya Buddha's mind visualizes the Ruyi knot (the Ruyi knot is like a Chinese knot), and inside the Ruyi knot visualizes the three masters and disciples of Tsongkhapa: Tsongkhapa, Jia Caojie, and Kezhujie.

Master Tsongkhapa represents Manjusri, Jia Caojie represents Guanyin, Kezhujie represents Vajra Hand, and the three masters and apprentices represent the three masters.

Just visualize the wish-fulfilling knot in Maitreya Buddha's heart with the three masters and disciples of Tsongkhapa in it, and then greet him like this in his heart: The three masters and disciples of Tsongkhapa, to accumulate blessings for all beings in the six realms, and to promote the Dharma, I welcome you. Come here, please, into the sky ahead of myself.

Just visualize the three statues of Tsongkhapa and his disciples coming out of Maitreya Buddha's wishful knot and sitting on three white clouds.

Three clouds just floated, from Tushitien to the sky in front of you all at once.

You must first make a long-lived prayer to Master Tsongkhapa.

How to pray for Tsongkhapa to live in the world for a long time? All the blessings that he has accumulated in his lifetimes have become the throne of lions, and the three thrones of lions make offerings to the three masters and disciples of Tsongkhapa.

55 Here begins the interpretation of the Guru Yoga text.

2. Welcoming Master Tsongkhapa:

Tusita's heart

Like a cloud of new cheese

All-wise Dharma King virtuous

May the disciples come here

"The heart of the master of the Tusita Heavens", the master of the Tusita is Maitreya Buddha.

"Blooming like a cloud of new cheese, the Dharma King of all wisdom is called wise", wise

It is called the Dharma name of Master Tsongkhapa, and it is called Lobsang Drapa in Tibetan.

"May the same disciples come here." At this time, Tsongkhapa's three disciples

Zun sat on the top of the three white clouds and floated into the air in front of him.

Three, seven offerings

(1) long-lived

On the lotus moon in the constellation Leo

Supreme Guru smiling

May this faith prevail over the field of blessing

Live for a hundred kalpas

In order to carry forward the Dharma, I pray that the three masters and disciples of Tsongkhapa will live on the throne of lions that I offer for hundreds of kalpas.

You should know the kind of throne carried by the eight lions. The eight lions represent the eight freedoms. There is a lotus on the throne. The lotus represents renunciation. In the middle of the lotus is a sun plate. There is a moon plate on the sun plate, and the moon plate represents the compassion, bodhicitta and convenient method of the three masters and disciples of Tsongkhapa.

The three masters and disciples of Tsongkhapa sat on the moon plate. In order to promote the Dharma and benefit all beings, the three masters and disciples of Tsongkhapa lived for hundreds of kalpas.

A kalpa lasts 12.9 billion years, and it is necessary to live for a long, long time. This is a prayer to live in the world for a long time.

Now your master is the same as Master Tsongkhapa. You have prayed for Master Tsongkhapa to live long, and your teacher will live long.

What does this do? Many virtuous masters come and go freely. If they want to come to this world, they will arrive immediately after making a vow. If they want to leave this world, they will leave immediately after a dozen "Powa Fa". They come and go very freely.

This kind of master should always pray for him to live in the world for a long time. This is very useful. He will not easily show his death, and he can live in the world for a long time.

——————————————For example, when my master Yongzeng Dharma King was eighty-five years old, he became seriously ill. He couldn’t eat or drink water, and he completely cut off his diet.

The disciples asked Master to take a look at the hospital. Master said that it was useless to go to the hospital and the disease could not be cured.

At the strong request of the disciples, Master went to the hospital for an examination, and it was found that he had advanced gastric cancer.

There's no other way. After returning from the hospital, Master is going to pass away, and he's going to arrange for the scriptures to be given to whom... So he started to arrange the funeral.

All the disciples of Dharma King Yongzeng were very sad in their hearts. They all gathered together to ask Master to live in the world for a long time. They all knelt in front of the Master and prayed: Master, you want to live in the world for a long time. If you don't live in the world, we won't get up.

He knelt down in front of the master and prayed for a long life.

However, the master said: "Everyone, get up, I don't have the ability.

"But everyone kept kneeling there and praying to the guru for a long time.

Finally, the master said, "Get up, everyone, how long do you want me to live? How long do you want me to live?" An old lama in front of him said that he wanted the master to live a hundred years.

Master was eighty-five years old at that time, and the master said: Ninety-seven, ninety-eight is a hundred years old, okay! The old lama said: Yes, yes.

The master said, "Get up and cook for me.

"Everyone got up and cooked for the master. The master ate well, and there was nothing to do. You could drink tea and eat. After that, the master was free of all diseases and lived to be ninety-seven years old.

Master passed away in May when he was ninety-seven years old.

This kind of master will pass away when he is eighty-five years old. If everyone makes a prayer for longevity, he will live to be ninety-seven years old. Quiet.

Everyone should understand that praying to the guru to live for a long time has such an effect.

Then why did the master get stomach cancer? It is the energy of exchanging bodhicitta that absorbs the suffering of others.

There is a master in Guide in Qinghai Province called Master Taxiu, who is my master's master, that is, the master of Dharma King Yongzeng.

At that time, there were many people with large tumors on their necks.

Master Taxiu attracted these people's tumors by exchanging bodhicitta from him.

Because he sent out such self-exchange bodhicitta, a tumor grew on his neck gradually, and it grew bigger and bigger.

Since then, the tumor disease in the Guide area of ​​Qinghai Province has been completely eliminated.

The tumor on Master Taxiu's neck gradually disappeared after two or three years.

A disciple once asked me, he said that some masters died of cancer, why does master also have cancer? There are two cases: one is the real karma that is inconceivable, that is, the cancer is caused by the karma of karma; the other is the real self-exchange bodhicitta that attracts sentient beings.

(2) Promise

Bowing includes bowing in words and deeds.

There are many different prostrations, including Hinayana, Mahayana, Sutra, and Tantra.

The most complete prostration is: put the two thumbs in the palms, then close the palms, prostrate to the guru, the Buddha, the Dharma, and the monk, open the palms, visualize there is a wish-fulfilling jewel in the palm, and the wish-fulfilling jewel has become countless. A wish-fulfilling treasure is offered to the guru's Three Jewels, and then the head touches the ground, and the five bodies bow down to the ground. This is a very consummate little prayer.

After doing the small prayer, then lie down on the whole body and do the big prayer. This kind of worship is very rewarding.

A prostration can accumulate the same blessings as a wheel-turning king, eliminate karma in body, speech, and mind, and obtain the blessings of Buddhas and Tathagatas in body, speech, and mind.

To pay homage to the guru, put your hands together and put your palms on the top of your head, you can get the blessing of the guru, and the merit is to be reborn in the pure land.

Promise to the Buddha, put your hands together and put your palms on your forehead, you can get the blessings of all Buddhas and Tathagatas, and can eliminate the karma created by your body.

Promise, put your hands together and put your palms on your throat, you can get the blessings of 84,000 Dharma doors, and can eliminate the karma of oral creation.

Promise to the monk, put your hands together and put your palms on your heart, you can get the blessings of Bodhisattvas, Arahants, and Dharma protectors.

Because bodhisattvas, arahants, and transcendent Dharma protectors are all Sangha treasures, they can eliminate karma created by intention and accumulate great blessings.

Prostration is also a kind of exercise, and prostration is the best exercise for the whole body. On the one hand, the exercise will bring blessings and eliminate karma, which is very special.

When doing this kind of worship, do not exclude the worship of the sutras, nor the worship of the Hinayana.

The obeisance of the Xianzong also has the obeisance of body, speech and mind, while the obeisance of the Hinayana is only of the body and mind.

Although they are all bowing down, there are still some differences in terms of whether they are consummated or not.

When prostrating, the first is to prostrate with one's body, recite the prostration text, and at the same time visualize the body transforming into countless bodies, bowing to the three deities of Tsongkhapa, master and apprentice, and bowing to the three jewels of the guru.

Then there is the prostration of the mouth, visualizing every pore of the body becoming a mouth with a tongue, and each mouth recites the prayer of Master Tsongkhapa: Mingmei blames Wei to see the hot color, straight wheat, and the like of Jiang Bei. Duhong Ma Lu Jiong Zaishan Weide Gangchen Kebezujian Tsongkhapa Lobsang Zabesha La Sowadi.

Thinking about it like this is very special.

Then there is the Yi Ding Li, the belief in the Three Jewels is the Yi Ding Li, the quiet faith, the belief that does not turn back is the Yi Ding Li.

The function of prostration is to generate respect and purity for the Three Jewels, and it can counteract arrogance. When kneeling down to pray, it will give up arrogance.

When bowing, recite:

Knowing all the wisdom

Yan Xianshi is good at speaking

Name He Yaoduan Yanshen

Salute to the Great Sage

You must first understand the merits of Master Tsongkhapa's words and deeds, and then bow down.

"Knowing the wisdom and wisdom of all things" means that Master Tsongkhapa can understand everything. He has the wisdom of the Buddha, the compassion of the Buddha, and the ability of the Buddha.

"Scholar Yan's ears are good at speaking", which is about the merits of Tsongkhapa's speech.

He taught the scriptures based on the foundation of his disciples.

Master Tsongkhapa wrote nineteen (according to the Ta'er Monastery edition) very thick works in his lifetime, each of which is the essence of eighty-four thousand teachings.

There used to be a great siddha who said: Suppose the Tripitaka of Ganzhuer and Danzhuer was destroyed by others (that is the karma of slandering the Dharma), and it no longer exists, as long as the ten thousand words of Master Tsongkhapa If the nine books exist, then the Dharma will remain splendid and will not be destroyed. Everyone knows the essence of the 84,000 Dharma schools of Shakyamuni Buddha. It is difficult to understand the true meaning of the Buddhist scriptures directly by reading the scriptures.

No matter how deep the foundation of sentient beings is, the Fa that Buddha Shakyamuni taught will be as deep.

For example, the Fa taught by Buddha Shakyamuni to the bodhisattvas of the ten places is not suitable for ordinary sentient beings; the Fa taught by Buddha Shakyamuni to Yaksha sentient beings is only suitable for Yaksha sentient beings and not suitable for other sentient beings.

So for different foundations, Buddha Shakyamuni taught different methods.

Buddha Shakyamuni taught a mantra to the bodhisattvas of the ten places. The virtue of this mantra is that he can become a Buddha by reciting it for seven days.

Ten Bodhisattvas can become Buddhas by reciting this mantra for seven days, but it is impossible for ordinary people to become Buddhas by reciting this mantra for seven days.

Once in Xi'an, a young master came to me, and after three bows he said, "Master Ngawang, I ask for a method.

I said what method do you ask for? He said to seek Buddhahood in seven days.

I said where is there such a method? He said yes, but he didn't have any blessings, he didn't get it, I heard that some people have obtained this method.

I said that I don’t have this method, but he said that there must be. Many people in Xi’an have obtained the method of becoming a Buddha in seven days.

I thought about it for a while and then asked him, in the method of becoming a Buddha in seven days, did you become a Buddha in seven days after cultivating it? He said he did not become a Buddha.

There is indeed such a mantra in the Buddhist scriptures. The virtue of this mantra is to recite it for seven days to become a Buddha.

Who can do this? Refers to the Ten Bodhisattvas.

Buddha Shakyamuni taught to the bodhisattvas of the ten places, how can we ordinary people become Buddhas so quickly? Therefore, it is difficult to understand directly by reading Buddhist scriptures.

The Buddhist scriptures must be explained, and their secrets must be unlocked.

However, it is very difficult to analyze the real content of the Buddhist scriptures in detail. It is very clear to use the works of Master Tsongkhapa to explain it.

"The name is glorious, and the body is strict." Master Tsongkhapa was very beautiful and very solemn when he was born.

In the past, many people in Tibet saw Master Tsongkhapa's appearance so solemn, and their eyes were always unblinking. Master Tsongkhapa said, don't keep looking at me like this.

Master Tsongkhapa looks like a boy Manjushri, very solemn.

"Respect the Great Sage of Seeing, Hearing and Thinking", as long as you see the image of Master Tsongkhapa, smell the Dharma of Master Tsongkhapa, and think about Master Tsongkhapa, the seeds of liberation will be planted.

Ruyi merit water flowers

Fragrant incense lamp coating, etc.

Realize the intention to change the cloud sea supply

Dedication Guru wins Fukuda

Offerings include personal offerings, thoughts offerings, mantra offerings, and Samantabhadra cloud offerings.

If it is convenient for you to move, make offerings of the eight offerings, the eight auspicious treasures, the seven treasures, and so on.

Thought offering is the use of thoughts to offer various offerings, that is, offering offerings such as eight offerings, seven treasures, etc., imagined in the mind.

Or visualize the blessings accumulated from life to life into various offerings to Master Tsongkhapa and Buddhas and Bodhisattvas.

Mantra offering is the ability to offer mantras into countless offerings to Buddhas and Bodhisattvas.

Recite the offering mantra three times, and the power of the mantra can reveal many offerings in front of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas.

Samantabhadra Cloud Offering is to visualize oneself as Samantabhadra Bodhisattva. Samantabhadra holds a wish-fulfilling jewel in his hand, and in the wish-fulfilling jewel there are countless offerings like a sea of ​​clouds, which appear to make offerings to Buddhas and Bodhisattvas.

The common result of making offerings is getting wealth, but different offerings have different results.

For example, water supply not only makes money, but also becomes kind-hearted.

Offering lamps not only brings wealth, but also enlightens wisdom.

Some people have problems with their eyes, but if they provide 100,000 or a million lamps, their eyes will get better. There are many such cases.

The teacher's body, speech and meaning are incredible.

For example, Zhangjia Living Buddha, the national teacher of Emperor Qianlong, was blind, his eyelids drooped down, and he could not open it no matter how he opened it.

In order to light up the eyes of Zhangjia Living Buddha, believers in Tibetan areas have lit tens of billions of lamps.

At the same time, the emperor also took out a lot of gold and silver treasures from the treasury and lit tens of billions of lamps.

After lighting the lamp, Zhangjia Living Buddha said that it doesn't matter if I can't see with my eyes, I can see with my fingers.

When he preached the scriptures, with his eyes closed, he could "read" any scriptures.

He can fluently "read" the letters of others by touching them with his hand.

He said that you help me light up tens of billions of lamps. Although my eyes did not light up, all five fingers "lit up" and I could see anything.

This is the inconceivable merit of Master's words and deeds.

In fact, his eyes are not blind, just for us to accumulate good fortune, he appears to be a blind man.

Everyone thinks that when Master was blind, he offered so many lamps. In fact, he gave us the opportunity to offer lamps and accumulate blessings.

There used to be a living Buddha in Ta'er Monastery called Chexi Living Buddha (Chexi Panzhida).

He has the word "A" on his tongue.

When he was teaching the scriptures, the word "A" would glow, and he was such a very special master.

He also said that he was blind, his eyelids drooped down, and he couldn't open his eyes.

Once, one of his disciples returned to the secular world and was very afraid to see the master, so he put on a hat and came to see the master.

Originally, he shouldn't wear a hat when he sees Master, and he has to take off his hat when he sees Master, but he still wears a hat.

When I came in, the master said who you are, I can't see it.

But when he approached, Master said, "Hey, why are you wearing a hat to see Master?" It was because he forgot to take off his hat when he was nervous.

Then the master said, "Come closer, I don't know who you are.

Where is your head? "He said, "Master, your head is under the hat. Just now, under that hat was my head."

"So the naked eye can have it or not, and the wise eye can see everything.

In order to allow sentient beings to accumulate blessings, for certain sentient beings, Master shows you one or two shortcomings, so that you can see Master's merits.

If you see a master's shortcomings, you can only see such a master in your blessings. If the blessings are not enough, you won't even be able to see the thirty-two solemn images.

For example, among the disciples of Living Buddha Zhangjia and Living Buddha Chexi, some people saw that Master was blind, while others saw that Master was a dignified Bodhisattva.

So some masters walk with lame feet.

After the disciples made offerings to the mantra, the blessings of the disciples increased. At this time, the master was healthy and free of any disease.

When the disciples receive bad news, the master's foot hurts and everything hurts. There will be problems with the body, and they will feel uncomfortable everywhere.

Originally, how could a Buddha suffer from illness? But when the disciples don't have any blessings, they see that there is something wrong with the master.

Offering fruits will not only gain wealth, but also food for life; offering music will not only gain wealth, but also a good reputation; offering wish-fulfilling treasures will not only gain wealth but also wishing for wish; offering thrones will not only gain wealth, but also promotions; offering elephants Treasures will not only get wealth, but also encounter Mahayana Buddhism; offering horse treasures will not only get wealth, but also work quickly and smoothly; offering lotus will not only get wealth, but your mood will not be polluted; offering various flowers will not only get wealth, but also appearance It will also be very solemn and beautiful; offering incense not only brings wealth, but also cleanliness of discipline.

You have to visualize many, many offerings in your mind, and each offering is spread throughout the entire space, and then make offerings to the guru and the three jewels, Tsongkhapa, the master and the disciple, and just like that.

(4) Confession

The accumulation of all without beginning

body, speech, mind, unwholesome karma

It violates the three laws

heartfelt repentance

How to repent? You can repent in the presence of a Buddha statue or the Three Jewels of the Guru:

I repent of the karma that I have created in my life after life, including all the karma created by my body, speech and mind, the karma created by greed, hatred and delusion, and the karma caused by breaking the precepts.

You must repent of all the karma you have created in your life.

The karma created by the body includes killing, stealing, and sexual immorality; the karma created by the mouth includes lying, alienating, malicious, and flattering.

The biggest karma in verbal karma is slandering the Buddhadharma, which is as big as killing an arahant.

The "three disciplines" are the precepts of not liberation, the precepts of bodhisattvas, and the precepts of tantric vehicles.

The karma of breaking the precepts must be repented.

Don't take empowerments indiscriminately. There are precepts for empowerments. At the very least, you must receive the Bodhisattva precepts. After receiving the Bodhisattva precepts, you must have pure precepts. Breaking the precepts is a huge sin.

The empowerment of yoga tantra and supreme yoga tantra must be tantric precepts.

The tantric precepts must be pure after they are received. The sins of breaking the tantric precepts are very serious.

Lay people have received the five precepts at home, and the five precepts must be pure.

There are two types of refuge in the lay family: the refuge with precepts and the refuge without precepts.

Refugees with precepts include those with one precept, those with two precepts, those with three precepts, and those with five precepts.

Taking refuge without precepts means that you do not need to take home precepts after taking refuge.

After taking refuge, you have entered Buddhism and have faith in the Three Jewels. You should do more good deeds and don't retreat from your beliefs.

Some people don't understand that taking refuge has precepts and non-precepts, and they say that you can't take refuge, that you can't do this, you can't do that, and so on.

In fact, there are not so many rules for conversion.

Ninety-nine percent of the people in our Tibetan area who take refuge in Buddhism, very few take precepts, and ninety percent of the disciples who take refuge are those who take refuge without precepts.

"Repent with the deepest heartache", we must repent in this way.

Don’t hide the mistakes and bad karma that you have done in the past. You must repent in front of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas: I made a mistake, I regret it now, and I will not do it again from now on.

By repenting in this way, all sins can be eliminated.

Confession is also a good way to cultivate health. If we do shameful things and keep hiding in our hearts, we will be very depressed. When we repent, the stone in our heart will fall to the ground.

Many people do not have the courage to repent of their sins. Once they have done something wrong, they will always hide in their hearts, and they will get sick. We must repent immediately so that our mentality will be balanced.

When repenting, visualize the innumerable rays of light from the bodies of the three masters and disciples of Tsongkhapa. Like the intense rays of light when hundreds of suns rise at the same time, they shoot out to illuminate our body, speech, and mind, and all the karma of our body, mind, and mind will disappear all at once.

Karma is like darkness, blessings are like sunshine, and when the sunshine comes out, the darkness disappears.

Think like this.

(5) Rejoice

Diligently cultivate the news in this turbid world

Eight Dharmas

The great line created by the parent

I'm happy to wait

There are five areas to rejoice in:

1. Rejoice in the merits and blessings of the Buddhas and Tathagatas;

2. Rejoice in the merits and blessings of all Bodhisattvas;

3. Hearing the merits and blessings of an arahant with the happy voice;

4. Acknowledge the merits and blessings of an arahant according to the predestined relationship;

5. Rejoice in the merits and blessings of ordinary people (people who have not realized emptiness).

In particular, we must follow the merits and blessings of the three deities of Xi Tsongkhapa, master and apprentice.

There are many merits and blessings of Tsongkhapa's three masters and disciples, and the greatest merit is listening, thinking, and cultivating.

Master Tsongkhapa learned the methods of various schools and obtained the inheritance of various schools.

We should follow the merits of Master Xi Tsongkhapa, such as cultivating, lecturing and debating, lecturing and cultivating the three treatises and the four major actions (xíng) and so on.

At that time, there were more than 660,000 monks in the six major monasteries in Tibet, and Master Tsongkhapa was the most accomplished master in the six major monasteries.

Master Tsongkhapa founded the Gelug Sect of the Yellow Sect after Wen Sixiu was completed.

All are welcome.

Master Tsongkhapa made offerings of mandras a million times during his retreat in Vokacheron, Tibet, and we should rejoice in this.

Master Tsongkhapa's four major industries are the establishment of Gelum Moran, the establishment of Ganden Monastery, the reconstruction of the Maitreya Buddha in Tibet, and the salvation of Tibetan Buddhism (mainly in terms of precepts).

Master Tsongkhapa founded Gelumoran (Gelug Dharma).

Grum Moran is held every year from the 1st to the 15th day of the first lunar month, offering tens of thousands of tormas, 100,000 lamps, 100,000 glasses of water, tens of thousands of flowers (Zambaga) and so on every day.

Tens of thousands of Tibetans and Tsongkhapa do this puja every year.

The purpose of the dharma assembly is that sentient beings in the six realms get rid of suffering and attain happiness.

This lineage continued from Master Tsongkhapa until before the "Cultural Revolution".

We should rejoice in these blessings and merits.

"The eight dharmas are not empty when the time is full."

The eight worldly dharmas refer to: want to be praised, not criticized; want to gain, not want to lose; want happiness, not pain; want fame, not obscurity or neglect.

What does it mean to cut off the eight dharmas in the world? When someone praises you, you are happy; when someone scolds you, you are miserable.

Master Tsongkhapa will not do this, it doesn't matter if he praises him or scolds him.

Praise, do not be greedy; scold, do not get angry.

Most people are happy when they have offerings, but they are not happy when they don’t.

Master Tsongkhapa would not do this.

If you don’t make offerings, you won’t be greedy, and if you don’t make offerings, you won’t care.

Praise or not.

If you get something, you will be happy, but you will not be unhappy if you don't get it.

This is the eight ways of breaking the world.

When the eight worldly dharmas are broken, the mind will be truly balanced.

Why are we unbalanced now? It’s because we haven’t broken the world’s eight dharmas, so we crave praise and can’t stand being scolded.

When you have reached a certain level in your practice, not only will you not be angry when you are scolded, but it will also be regarded as eliminating karma.

He scolded me because I had karma, so he wanted to scold me and help me get rid of this karma! very good! With this kind of mentality, you will basically be able to balance your mind.

You can visualize it and hear someone yelling at you in various ways, can you bear it? Some people can't even stand the visualization and get angry.

Visualize that after you can stand it, someone really scolds you one day, can you stand it? If you can bear it, you will be balanced.

This is important.

Venerable Atisha had two Brahmin disciples who were very bad-tempered, and the other disciples persuaded Venerable Atisha to drive these two disciples out.

Venerable Atisha said: No, these two are my masters. Whether I can succeed in practicing forbearance depends on them.

Who dares to scold me in the Tibetan area now? No one dared to scold me, only the two of them dared to scold me, and the two of them were my masters.

(6) Please turn the Falun

supreme masters

Dharma body empty cloth sad wisdom cloud

Willing to weigh the soil of the machine

Universal rain of magic

Please meditate in your heart when turning the wheel of Falun: I pray to the three masters and disciples of Tsongkhapa, to turn the wheel of Falun mercifully to save all sentient beings.

The function of turning the Falun is to save sentient beings in the six realms.

I made this request a few times in my heart, and then visualized that the three masters and disciples of Tsongkhapa transformed many incarnations to go to various places in the world, and transformed many masters to go to various places to teach scriptures, teach the Fa, and save sentient beings. This is a request.

Before teaching the scriptures, you must ask for the Fa.

The law must require it, unlike school lectures.

Dharma doors are ordered like school courses, but you must ask for them.

Asked for a few functions:

First, accumulate great blessings;

Second, the karma of slandering the law can be eliminated;

Third, you will cherish this practice.

Because this is what I begged, not sent to me, so I have to cherish it.

"The Cloud of Compassion and Wisdom", the master's wisdom and compassion are the cloud, the rain that falls from the cloud is the Fa, the disciple's foundation is the soil, and our desire for liberation is the seed.

When we have this seed, the teacher will teach the scriptures and spread the Fa, and if the rain of the Fa falls on the foundation of our disciples, the seed will germinate and bear fruit. That’s what it means.

(7) Backward

do my best

Benefit the Dharma and sentient beings

May His Holiness Tsongkhapa

The holy career will be revealed for a long time

After turning back, the blessings will not disappear.

If there is no devotion, a lot of good fortune will be eliminated when you get angry, jealousy will also eliminate good fortune, and many troubles will be eliminated.

If you are angry with the Bodhisattva, the blessings of hundreds of kalpas will disappear in an instant.

If you are angry with your guru, the good fortune may be wiped out for dozens of kalpas.

It depends on how angry you are. When you are very angry, the blessings of thousands of kalpas will disappear.

If you are angry with your parents, relatives, friends, benefactors, etc., it will destroy good fortune, and even if you are angry with your enemies, it will destroy good fortune.

Get angry at the enemy, and you suffer and take away your good fortune.

But after devotion, not only will this blessing not disappear, but it will become bigger and never disappear, so devotion is very important.

For example, the reward of your blessings is to become a Buddha. When you become a Buddha, the reward will come out.

Before becoming a Buddha, no matter how much the retribution comes out, it will never be finished.

When we usually dedicate our devotions, we return blessings to sentient beings in the six realms, free from suffering and attain happiness, the Dharma lives forever, the world is at peace, and everything goes well.

The most extraordinary devotion is that the Buddhadharma will live forever in the world, so be sure to dedicate it well.

The Buddhadharma can benefit all beings. With the Buddhadharma, we will have the wisdom to truly get rid of suffering and attain happiness, and will have a direction.

"To do all the good roots I have accumulated", the good roots are their own blessings.

"Benefit the Dharma and sentient beings", benefit the Dharma and sentient beings.

"Especially wish His Holiness Tsongkhapa, the holy teaching career will be manifested for a long time", especially the Dharma door of devotion to Master Tsongkhapa's double cultivation of esoteric and esoteric living for a long time.

4. Prayer of Master Tsongkhapa

Mingmei Shiwei got to see the hot color in person

Zhimai's pro is more than Wang so that Jiang is sad

Du Hong Ma Lu Jiong Zai San Weed

Gangchen Kebezuchen Tsongkhapa

Lausanne Zabechara Sowadi

This is the prayer of Master Tsongkhapa in Tibetan.

If time is sufficient, before reciting Master Tsongkhapa's prayer, he should make offerings to the three masters and disciples of Tsongkhapa.

Master Tsongkhapa's prayer is very special.

Reciting the prayers of Master Tsongkhapa is equivalent to reciting the prayers of the Buddhas and Tathagatas.

Master Tsongkhapa's prayer has both Chinese and Tibetan versions, but the Tibetan prayer cannot be translated into Chinese without its full meaning.

Therefore, it is better to use Tibetan when reciting prayers.

Chinese can only translate about 95% of the meaning, but not 100% because the content of this prayer is too profound.

The following is the prayer of Master Tsongkhapa in Chinese:

no predestined sadness

Unsullied Wisdom King's Subtle Sound

The Secret Lord of the Devil's Army

Snowland Zhiyan Tsongkhapa

Prayer before Lobsang Chava

"Avalokitesvara", "Avalokitesvara" is the holy name of Guanyin Bodhisattva.

"The Subtle Sound of the Unsullied Wisdom King", "The Subtle Sound" is the holy name of Manjushri Bodhisattva.

"Secret Lord of the Destroying Demon Army", "Secret Lord" is the holy name of Vajrapani Bodhisattva.

The holy names of the three parents are all included.

"Snowland Zhiyan Tsongkhapa, pray in front of Luosang Zhahua", "Luosang Zhahua" is the holy name of Master Tsongkhapa.

Master Tsongkhapa's prayer contains four holy names.

The merits of the four holy names.

The merit of reciting the holy name of Guanyin Bodhisattva is the same as the merit of reciting the holy name of Buddha and Bodhisattva as many as 6.2 billion grains of sand in the Ganges.

The merit of reciting the holy name of Manjushri is the same as the merit of reciting the holy name of the Buddhas and Tathagatas, because Manjushri Bodhisattva is the master of the Buddhas and Tathagatas. Before the Buddhas and Tathagatas became Buddhas, he was the master of the Buddhas and Tathagatas. The Buddha taught the scriptures and preached the Dharma.

After they became Buddhas, Manjushri became the disciples of all Buddhas and Tathagatas, and propagated the Dharma.

The vow power of Manjushri is the most extraordinary vow power of the Buddhas and Tathagatas.

The merit of reciting the holy name of Vajrapani is the same as the merit of reciting the holy name of countless wrathful deities.

Why do Buddhas and Bodhisattvas show their angry deities? It is to subdue your hatred.

Wrath signifies renunciation of hatred.

To know the meaning of "no sympathy and contemplation of freedom".

The compassionate heart of Guanyin Bodhisattva is as great as that of Master Tsongkhapa. Master Tsongkhapa is the incarnation of Guanyin Bodhisattva.

"Unsuccessful sadness and contemplation of freedom" has the meaning of inner and outer secrets, and the meaning of outer secrets is this.

What does "The Unsullied Wisdom King's subtle sound" mean? How much wisdom is Manjushri Bodhisattva, so much wisdom is Master Tsongkhapa, Master Tsongkhapa is the incarnation of Manjushri Bodhisattva.

"Secret Master of Destroying the Demon Army", as great as Vajrapani Bodhisattva is, Master Tsongkhapa has as much power, and Master Tsongkhapa is the incarnation of Master Tsongkhapa.

Master Tsongkhapa is the incarnation of compassion, wisdom and power of all Buddhas and Tathagatas.

"Snow Region Zhiyan Tsongkhapa" means "Snow Region" refers to the Tibetan area.

All the great siddhas in the Tibetan area together are comparable to Master Tsongkhapa, and any single one is not as good as Master Tsongkhapa, so he is called Master Tsongkhapa Zhiyan.

"Tsongkhapa", Tsongkha is the name of a place, and "ba" refers to people.

"Praying before the Losang Drabha", "Losang Drabha" is the name of Master Tsongkhapa.

"Luosang Zhahua" is translated as virtuous.

I want to pray in front of Lobsang Drakwa, and I pray that Master Tsongkhapa will grant me the blessings of the Buddhas and Tathagatas, which is what I mean.

Master Tsongkhapa's prayer has the meaning of inner and outer secrets, which is very special.

It includes not only the prayers of the Buddhas and Tathagatas, but also the mantras of the four deities of Tantric Buddhism, which are very, very special.

Reciting the prayers of Master Tsongkhapa can cut off afflictions, cut off knowledge and obstacles, and can also accumulate blessings, and especially open up wisdom, and can get the blessings of all Buddhas and Tathagatas.

Master Tsongkhapa's prayer includes one hundred and eight methods of breathing, increasing, embracing, and punishing.

There are seven ways to unlock wisdom, more than 10 ways to eliminate disasters, and more than 10 ways to eliminate magic.

There is also a special method of praying for rain. If the sky does not rain and is very dry, you can pray for rain with the prayer of Master Tsongkhapa, which is to pray for the Dragon King to rain.

Master Tsongkhapa's prayer also has a weeding method, which is the method of getting rid of weeds.

In the past, a master went to beg for alms. Many people closed their homes and were busy working in the fields. An old man named Cai Rangji was also busy pulling weeds in the fields. The master made alms with this old man.

The old man said: I can give you something to eat, but I don't have time to get it.

The master said: You go get something, I will pull the weeds.

The weeds were removed from the field by weeding.

And no weeds will grow for 100 years after weeding.

Master Tsongkhapa's prayer also includes one hundred and eight kinds of methods of eliminating diseases, especially the methods of eliminating dragon diseases, as well as methods of eliminating evil spirits, methods of attracting wealth, and methods of longevity.

Therefore, there are three thick books explaining these five rituals and these methods.

Last summer, I passed on these methods to the lamas of Tuola Monastery for four months in total.

Master Xiu Tsongkhapa prays to the grammar door, and exorcising demons is the most extraordinary.

Tell you a story.

Master Tsongkhapa's esoteric disciple is called Xirao Sangge, and Xirao Sangge has a disciple called Huadan Sangwu.

Huadan Sangwu practiced in seclusion in one place, mainly cultivating the prayers of Master Tsongkhapa, and after a period of practice, he achieved it.

When he visualizes the Great Weed, others can really see that he has become the Great Weed.

He visualizes Vajra Hand, and others appear to him to be Vajra Hand.

He visualizes anything that can manifest.

He has been in retreat until he has achieved success.

In the place where he lived there was a large family with only one child.

This child has been hindered by the upper body of the Demon King for three years, and the child has been sick for three years.

The owner of this family invited all the best doctors in the Tibetan area to come over to see his child, but it didn't work.

Asking many eminent monks and great virtues to do things doesn't work either.

After that child was put on by the Demon King, he often said what the beings of the demonic way did and what they said.

It is often said that this one will die today, and that tomorrow will be taken away by our demonic beings, and so on.

The people he talked about would die the next day, which was very effective.

Later, the owner of this family went to Master Huadan Sangwu, knelt in front of Master Huadan Sangwu and explained the situation of his children in detail, and asked the master to exorcise the demons.

Master Huadan Sangwu said: "Is it possible, I want to try it first.

Take my rosary beads, take them down, put them one by one around the wall of your house, then put a pair of my shoes on either side of the door, and then put this seat cushion on the roof on which I sit, See what works.

After the owner of the house did so, the Demon King said, "Oh, I want to run up, and the Great Weed is pressing me on it. Around this wall are the soldiers of the Yama King, and two wrathful deities are guarding it. there at the door.

I really regret it now, why did I stay here for so long? "The Demon King cried.

Seeing this, the owner of this family went to report to Master Huadan Sangwu.

Master Huadan Sangwu said, "Then I will go."

As soon as Master Huadan Sangwu arrived at their home, the Demon King knelt down in front of Master Huadan Sangwu and said, "Forgive us, you forgive us all beings of the devil's way!" The master said, "I can't forgive you, all of you, the living beings of the devil's way, from now on. Can't hurt anyone in the future.

The Demon King said, "Our demonic beings are many times more numerous than your human beings!" We, the demonic beings, suck people's spirit, qi and blood, and people's energy, and we rely on this to live.

You are merciful to people, and we are also a type of sentient beings. You must also show great mercy! "The Demon King asked.

Master Huadan Sangwu thought about it and said, "Yes, from now on, you can't harm the sentient beings who recite Master Tsongkhapa's prayer 108 times a day." The devil said, "Okay! I swear that we will never harm the sentient beings who recite Master Tsongkhapa's prayer one hundred and eight times a day, nor will we absorb their spirit, their blood, or their energy.

If among our demonic beings, anyone harms someone who has recited Master Tsongkhapa's prayers one hundred and eight times, the demon's head will be split into ten pieces, and its body will be split into 10,000 pieces. "So swore.

Therefore, from now on, all beings of the demonic way will never harm those who recite the prayers of Master Tsongkhapa.

If you are afraid of ghosts, you can recite this prayer; if you are afraid of demons, it is better to recite this prayer.

When reciting, it is even more special for everyone to recite in Tibetan: Ming Mei Zhewei has seen the hot sex Zhimai in person, Wang Bo Jiang Bei Sang Du Hong Ma Lu Jiong Zai Sang Wei De Gang Cen Ke Bei Zu Jian Tsong Kaba Losangdha Bechara Sowadi and everyone followed Master's Tibetan accent to learn this prayer meeting.

There are many visualizations about this, and today I will tell you about visualizations.

Visualize that the three masters and disciples of Tsongkhapa are already in the sky in front of you, and then each of the three masters and disciples of Tsongkhapa emits a light inside. The light inside is empty, a light as thick as a tube.

The three rays of light come out from the hearts of the three masters and disciples of Tsongkhapa, and finally reach the place five inches above your head. The three rays of light combine together, and then you recite the prayer of Master Tsongkhapa.

When reciting Master Tsongkhapa's prayer, a lot of nectar water flowed out of the body of the three masters and disciples of Tsongkhapa.

It flows out through the tube of light and into your body.

All the bad things are washed away and discharged, and then your body is filled with nectar water.

After being filled with nectar water, some nectar water suddenly became Manjushri, and some nectar water became Prajna Sutra.

Both Manjusri Bodhisattva and Prajna Sutra emit immeasurable light, and the great wisdom, quick wisdom, deep wisdom, and eloquence wisdom of all Buddhas and Tathagatas have all become Manjushri, Prajna Sutra, or wisdom sword, and are integrated into your body.

You just recite the prayer while you visualize it.

The nectar water flowing from the hearts of the three masters and disciples of Tsongkhapa turns your karma into blessings, troubles into happiness, all beings in the demonic way into deities, and evil spirits into luck.

Master Tsongkhapa prayed to the text to have this extraordinary visualization.

Self-study or a total of more than 100,000 times.

After 100,000 times of practice, it is best to insist on reciting it 108 times a day.

5. Integration

After reciting, visualize a thicker central channel in the middle of your body. Master Tsongkhapa's two disciples merged into Master Tsongkhapa's body. Master Tsongkhapa became smaller and smaller. The top of the head descends along the central channel, and imagine that your heart becomes an eight-petal lotus flower. The moon wheel is laid flat on the lotus flower. Master Tsongkhapa sits on the moon wheel. There is no difference.

Master Tsongkhapa is always seated in your heart lotus.

Then you read:

Possessing the Supreme Treasure of the Master of Victory

Always sit in the lotus of my heart

The vast heart of compassion holds me

Achievements that bestow body, speech and mind

6. Praise

The sea of ​​dust solemnly lists the master, the deity, the three treasures, and the salty offerings. Cluster Sumeru, Four Continents, Sun, Moon, Strict Desires, Offerings to All Buddhas, Crowds, Climbing to the Pure Land, Praying for Use

Manza

Please arouse Bodhicitta and listen carefully!

Today is about Manza.

There are several aspects to Manza to understand:

The meaning of Mandra, the thirty-seven offerings to Mandra, the merits of Mandra, the seven offerings to Mandra, and how to repair Mandra.

The meaning of Manza

The purest, most complete, and most auspicious things in the entire universe are all offered to Buddhas and Bodhisattvas, and they are called Mandras.

Mandha is the way of accumulating good fortune, the most excellent method of accumulating good fortune.

The more Manza is repaired, the more blessings will grow.

The blessings have grown, and everything is done smoothly, and the wishes are fulfilled, and the practice is very fast.

If you want to achieve success in your practice, you need to increase blessings, eliminate karmic obstacles, and get the blessing of the Three Jewels of the Guru. With these conditions, practice can be accomplished.

Mandras can be divided into: outer mandras, inner mandras, mimandras, and emptiness mandras.

We must first understand Waimandra, and we must make offerings to Waimandra.

Once you understand the outer mantra, and after you become familiar with the offerings, make offerings 100,000 or 200,000 times. After you make offerings slowly for a period of time (two or three months), you can pass on the inner mantras.

Waimandha is the foundation. If one is unfamiliar with outermandha and lacks this foundation, then it is impossible to understand Neimandha.

Nemandra has made offerings for a period of time and can speak of Mimandra.

After Mimandra has practiced for a few years, one can speak of emptiness mandra.

This time we are going to talk about Waimanza.

There are four outer mandras, and the first one is the thirty-seven offering mandras.

Why is it called Thirty-Seven Offering Mandha? It has thirty-seven different offerings, and offering these offerings is called the Thirty-Seven Offering Mandha.

The second one is the Twenty-Three Offering Mantra. It has only twenty-three different offerings, so it is called the Twenty-Three Offering Mantra.

The third one is the Nine Offering Mandha, there are only nine different offerings.

The fourth is the Seven Offering Mandrak, there are only seven different offerings.

Thirty-seven offerings include twenty-three offerings, nine offerings, and seven offerings.

Once you understand the thirty-seven offerings of mantras, you will understand the other three mantras.

Thirty-seven offerings to Mandra have inheritance.

Our lineage is the lineage of Gelugpa, that is, the lineage of Master Tsongkhapa.

There is a place in Lhasa called Vokacheron, where Master Tsongkhapa once retreated and offered thirty-seven offerings a million times to the Mandra.

At that time, he made offerings to Mandra and used the Bodhi Meridian on his right hand to rub the Mandrak Plate until the skin around the Bodhi Meridian was completely broken and bleeding, and even the bones inside could be seen, to this extent.

Master Tsongkhapa made offerings to the Mandra a million times, accumulating a lot of good fortune, and dedicating this blessing to the disciples who studied with Master Tsongkhapa in the Gelug Sect and the guardian of Gelug Teachers of teaching.

Because the blessing of Tsongkhapa's devotion is very, very large, the Gelugpa is usually richer.

Gelug sect monasteries, Gelug sect disciples, and Gelug sect guardians are usually relatively wealthy, which is somewhat different from other sects.

This is the reason why Master Tsongkhapa's offering to Mandra was blessed.

Our lineage is also the lineage of Master Tsongkhapa.

With the inheritance of such an accomplished guru, if we practice Mantra according to this lineage, we will definitely be blessed by Master Tsongkhapa, and we will definitely be able to accumulate great blessings. This is very important and very important!

2. Thirty-seven offerings to Mandha

The first thing in the outer mandra is the thirty-seven offerings of the mandra.

To talk about the Thirty-Seven Offering Mantras, we must first understand the concept of a universe and how the universe came into being.

When the universe first formed, a vast and boundless giant tornado blew up in the sky. This giant tornado was very hard and hard, and not a drop of water could drop into it. Heavy rain fell on the giant tornado for thousands of years.

Each drop of rain is the size of a human head, or the head of a horse or an ox.

The rain contains hardware, soil of various colors, gold, silver, crystal and other jewelry.

After the heavy rain, because gold is relatively heavy, it slowly sank, forming a very thick foundation of gold, several kilometers thick.

Manza formed a boundless ocean on the golden foundation. The waves in the ocean moved and pushed the soil of the seabed to different places in the south, south and northwest, forming various mountains and terrains. In this way, the earth is formed.

Outside the earth is the ocean.

When the universe was first formed, it was like this.

Then, when offering the mandra, recite and visualize:

Om Ban Za Pot Mi A Hum

This is a spell to bless the golden foundation.

Extremely pure and free golden foundation

This is the golden foundation I just mentioned.

om banzareka hum

This is a mantra to visualize and bless Tieweishan.

Surrounded by Iron Mountains

Outside the entire universe, as described in Buddhist scriptures, there is a Tiewei Mountain, and the Tiewei Mountain surrounds a boundless giant tornado.

Tieweishan should also be visualized.

In these two sentences, I visualized the extremely pure golden foundation of great freedom, and all the gold several kilometers thick was offered to Buddhas and Bodhisattvas.

There are thirteen different earths in this universe, and the middle earth is called "Mt. Sumeru".

Mount Sumeru is roughly the image of a four-layered square earth.

Surrounding Mount Sumeru is the Sea of ​​Nectar.

In the sea of ​​nectar lived eight great dragon kings. Each dragon king had countless treasures. All these treasures and dragon kings should be offered to Buddhas and Bodhisattvas.

The entire north, south, east and west of Mount Sumeru is formed by various gems.

For example, the east side of Mount Sumeru is formed by various gemstones mainly composed of crystal; the south side of Mount Sumeru is formed by various gemstones mainly composed of sapphire; the west side of Mount Sumeru is formed by various gemstones mainly composed of ruby. ; The north of Mount Sumeru is formed by various gems mainly made of gold.

The entire Mount Sumeru is formed by different treasures.

These are to be offered to Buddhas and Bodhisattvas.

Mount Sumeru has four floors. The first, second, and third floors are where the yaksha living beings live. There are also human beings with supernatural powers and achievements, and some arahants living there, but mainly the yasha living beings live there.

On the first floor is Pan Yaksha.

What is Pan Yaksha? King Pan Yaksha holds a golden plate in his hand, and there are various wish-fulfilling treasures in the golden plate.

King Pan Yaksha has tens of billions of Yaksha sentient beings, each Yaksha is very rich, and every Yaksha has a treasury.

The second floor is the Rosary Yaksha.

The rosary Yaksha king holds a wish-fulfilling rosary in his hand. There are tens of billions of yaksas on this floor, and he is very rich, even richer than the first floor.

The third floor is Changle Yaksha.

Changle Yaksha beings are often extremely happy, they have almost no pain, their wealth is enormous, and there are also tens of billions of Yaksha beings on it.

The fourth floor is where the Four Heavenly Kings live.

The Four Heavenly Kings are the Heavenly King of Chiguo, the Heavenly King of Growth, the Heavenly King of Guangmu, and the Heavenly King of Duowen.

The Four Heavenly Kings also have many dependents and many treasures.

In the center is Mount Sumeru, the King of the Mountains

When reciting, you should visualize the precious earth at the same time, and make offerings to Buddhas and Bodhisattvas on this earth and all living beings, jewels, and pure and perfect things on this earth.

When cultivating together, the speed of everyone should be the same. When cultivating by yourself, you can visualize the center as the king of the mountain and Mount Sumeru. You can visualize it a little slower, it can be a few minutes. If you can't visualize it at that time, you can visualize it for a few hours or even a few days. The view came out and made offerings to the Buddha and Bodhisattva on Mount Sumeru.

East Shrine Island

It is the name of the earth to the east of Mount Sumeru.

There are more than 7 billion people on our earth, and there are more than 10 billion people on the earth of East Saint Body Continent. The area, population, enjoyment, wealth, and appearance are twice that of our earth.

When reciting the Eastern Holy Body Continent, visualize this way.

Nanzhanbuzhou

It is the name of the earth to the south of Mount Sumeru.

The Nanzhanbuzhou mentioned in the Buddhist scriptures refers to the earth we live in. There are more than 200 countries and a population of more than 7 billion. Each country has many tall buildings, trees, flowers, and gold and silver jewelry. All these must be visualized. Make offerings to Buddhas and Bodhisattvas.

The blessings of offering to Manza are very big, and if you really visualize it, the blessings of making an offering to Manza are huge.

When we make offerings to Nanzhanbuzhou, we must especially visualize the Vajra seat in the middle of Nanzhanbuzhou.

The Vajra Seat is Bodhgaya, the place where Sakyamuni Buddha attained enlightenment. At the same time, the Vajra Seat is also the place where one thousand Buddhas attained Buddhahood.

To the east of Nanzhanbuzhou is Mount Wutai, which is the dojo of Manjushri.

This kind of place where Manjushri Bodhisattva practices like the Pure Land, we ordinary people can't see it, but those who have achieved it can see it, and this also makes offerings to Buddhas and Bodhisattvas.

In the south of Nanzhanbuzhou, there is the dojo of Guanyin Bodhisattva, which is Nanhai Potala, which refers to Putuo Mountain in Zhejiang, which also makes offerings to Buddhas and Bodhisattvas.

To the west of Nanzhanbuzhou is the Pure Land of Dakinis, Wujing Kanzhulin, and this Pure Land of Dakinis should also be offered.

Now everyone thinks that this is the former Dakini holy place, and this Dakini holy place is Afghanistan.

There are a lot of people who have done it in Afghanistan before.

The place where Buddha Shakyamuni first taught the secret teachings was Afghanistan, which used to belong to India.

There was a king in India named King Enzabodhi, who made offerings to Shakyamuni Buddha and asked Buddha Shakyamuni for the Dharma.

Buddha Shakyamuni asked him to become a monk, but he said no, he couldn't become a monk, and he couldn't do this ascetic practice.

Buddha Shakyamuni said, what kind of practice do you want? He said that you want to practice happily, and he asked for a way to practice happily at home.

Then Buddha Shakyamuni taught him the Dharma Door of Tantric Buddhism - Dense Vajra.

After preaching the Dharma, Buddha Shakyamuni gave King Enzhabodhi the empowerment of the Dharani Vajra, and King Enzhabodhi was accomplished.

To other people in the country, Buddha Shakyamuni taught the esoteric Dharma, and all those people achieved it.

After everyone was accomplished, Afghanistan was emptied once, and all the people in the whole country were freed, and the place was empty.

Afterwards, some people in the country achieved the achievement, flew to the pure land of various Buddhas and Bodhisattvas, and flew away; some people burned their bodies with natural fire and passed away.

And just like that, the country is empty again.

After it was empty, many people from outside lived in this place. At this time, a disciple of King Enzabodhi, who was accomplished by the dragon girl, went to teach sutras and esoteric methods. All the people were accomplished, and it was empty again.

The country of Afghanistan has been emptied three times in total.

It is such a holy place of dakini. It is necessary to visualize the state in which this holy place was very successful and rich in the past, which can make offerings to Buddhas and Bodhisattvas.

There is a pure land of Shambhala in the north of Nanzhanbuzhou.

The Pure Land of Shambhala is the pure land of the world, the pure land of the world, but it has not been found so far.

"Kalachakra" says: There are ninety-six million cities in the Pure Land of Shambhala, where living beings of heaven, humanity, Asura, and inhumans live.

The sentient beings in the Pure Land of Shambhala live a life like a god or a human being.

There are snow-capped mountains, Baoshan, and a lot of gems and treasures.

Shambhala has twenty-five generations of Dharma Kings, and now it is the twenty-first generation of Dharma Kings of Inexhaustible Dharma Kings.

The Dharma King of Wuxie came back from Master Danchen Nuori, who founded the Tuola Temple.

Each dharma king ruled the Pure Land of Shambhala for a hundred years.

Three hundred and thirteen years from now, that is, when the twenty-fifth Dharma King of Shambhala will arrive, then the Pure Land of Shambhala will appear, the Dharma King of Shambhala will rule the entire Nanzhan Province, and the Dharma will once again be thriving.

This Shambhala Pure Land can also make offerings to Buddhas and Bodhisattvas.

115 Nanzhanbuzhou, we probably all know that there are more than 200 countries with the purest, most complete, and most precious things, and everyone can make offerings to Buddhas and Bodhisattvas.

Nishiniu Hezhou is the name of the earth to the west of Mount Sumeru.

This earth is three times larger than our Nanzhan continent, and human beings are also three times larger than Nanzhan continent. Human appearance is several times better than Nanzhan continent in all aspects, and the blessing is very great.

People on the earth of Xiniu Hezhou can live to be five hundred years old, people on the earth of Dongshengshenzhou can live to be 250 years old, people on the earth of Nanzhanbuzhou have no fixed life, how many years they can live, some people can live Some people live to be 50 years old, some people can only live to be 10 years old, and some people even die as soon as they are born.

This is not the case in other continents except Nanzhanbu.

Xiniu Hezhou

Ninety-nine percent of people live to be five hundred years old, but if some people have a big obstacle, or because of wars, there are also people who die at the age of four or two hundred, but this is very rare.

Manzabekuruzhou is the name of the earth to the north of Mount Sumeru.

It is the most splendid of the four great earths, and the people on this continent can live a thousand years.

On the night before the age of a thousand, a voice will naturally come from the sky, and this voice will tell him: Tomorrow your death is coming.

After hearing this voice, he will die the next day.

Because such a bad voice will be heard before death, many Buddhist scriptures translate it into "Evil Sound Island" when translating Beikuluzhou.

The blessings of the people on this continent are very, very great. There is no need to plant any grains and seeds. Natural rice will grow naturally without labor.

The good news is very big, this is Beijuluzhou.

The largest continent in the universe is Mount Sumeru, plus four continents are five continents, plus eight small continents, there are a total of thirteen continents (earth).

The five continents have been mentioned above, and the following are eight small continents (small earth).

A small earth is only half the size of a large earth,

body continent, holy body continent

Located on both sides of East Saint Body Continent.

On the left of East Saint Body Continent, there is a small earth called Shenzhou, and on the right there is a small earth called Saint Body Continent. They are only half the size of the continent.

The people on the East Saint Body Continent can live to be two hundred and fifty years old, but the people on the small continent cannot live that long, about one hundred and seventy-five years old. The people on the small continent do not have such great blessings, but there are still A lot of gold and silver jewelry, there are many extraordinary things, can make offerings to Buddhas and Bodhisattvas.

Fuzhou, don't Fuzhou

It is the two small globes on the left and right of Nanzhanbuzhou.

The longest human beings on these two continents can live to be fifty years old, and their appearance is inferior to our earth in every aspect.

Xiaoxingzhou, Shengdaoxingzhou

On both sides of Xiniu Hezhou, Xiaoxingzhou is on the left and Shengdaoxingzhou is on the right.

These two small continents are only half the size of Xiniu Hezhou, and the people on them can live two hundred and fifty years old, which is better than our earth.

Mandzakuru Chau, Yousheng Lu Chau

There are two small continents on the left and right of Beiju Luzhou. People on these two small continents can live for five hundred years, and their blessings are also great.

These are the thirteen continents (earth).

These thirteen continents are all habitable earth for human beings.

The distance between the earth and the earth is very far.

Master Gazang Qusong said, "If a stone the size of a yak falls from the nearest earth, and if it falls straight down without encountering any obstacles, it will take at least a year."

There were not only thirteen earths, but many.

But these earths that we are now feeding are the earths that can be inhabited by human beings.

The earths in other heavenly realms, the earths inhabited by devas, and the other pure lands are all earths, but they are not the earths mentioned in our offering mantra.

The earths in Manza are all habitable earths.

After the visualization of the thirteen earths is completed, there are a few very special offerings to be visualized: the King of Baoshan, the wishful tree, the ox full of desire, and the natural rice.

The King of Baoshan imagines that there is a King of Baoshan in the east of Dongshengshenzhou, which is a huge mountain formed by various gems.

The King of Baoshan wanted to make offerings to Buddhas and Bodhisattvas.

The wishful tree is a kind of tree in the south of Mount Sumeru. If you want anything, you can ask for it under the tree. This is the wishful tree.

This is also to make offerings to Buddhas and Bodhisattvas.

Manyu Cow is in Hezhou, Xiniu.

It has a very special feature. Its milk can eliminate all diseases, so the people on Xi Niu Hezhou have almost no diseases, and they all drink the milk of this lustful cow.

A very special lust-fulfilling ox makes offerings to Buddhas and Bodhisattvas.

Natural rice There is natural rice on Beijuluzhou.

Natural rice is rice that grows naturally.

People on Beijuluzhou can have natural rice without labor.

Mandha natural rice is offered to Buddhas and Bodhisattvas.

Regarding natural rice, in some caves in Nanzhanbuzhou, there were highland barleys as big as peas that were blessed a long time ago. These highland barleys and grains gradually became smaller after hundreds of years.

On Beijulu Island, it is different. The grains and wheat on it are very large.

A single wheat seed is as big as an egg, and the other five grains are very large. Naturally, there is no need to plant them. The crops grow naturally, which is very special, and their blessings are great.

The above are a few special and extraordinary offerings, and we should also visualize and make offerings to Buddhas and Bodhisattvas.

The most special offering is the Seven Treasures.

The seven treasures are the Wheel Treasure, Ruyi Treasure, Queen Treasure, Minister Treasure, Elephant Treasure, Horse Treasure, and General Treasure.

We need to know about Qibao, the king is divided into five kings: the king who can rule the four continents of Nanzhanbuzhou, Beijuluzhou, Xiniuhezhou, and Dongshengshenzhou is called the King of Jinlun; the king who can rule three continents is called the King of Yinlun; The king of two continents is called the king of copper wheels; the king of one continent is called the king of iron wheels; the king of one region is called the king of locality.

That's it for five different kings.

The seven treasures mentioned here are the treasures of the Golden Wheel King.

The Silver Wheel King does not have the Seven Treasures, nor does the Iron Wheel King have the Seven Treasures, only the Golden Wheel King has the Seven Treasures.

We don't have the Seven Treasures now, but we can visualize the Seven Treasures as offerings to Buddhas and Bodhisattvas, and the merits are very, very great.

Lunbao Lunbao refers to a very large golden wheel with a thousand pillars, which can emit immeasurable light.

Wherever the Golden Wheel King wants to go, he can fly there by sitting on the Golden Wheel.

The Golden Wheel King of the Wishful Treasure put the wishful jewel on the roof and offered some offerings to make offerings.

Queen Bao The concubine of the King of Jinlun is called Queen Bao, and the concubine of the local king is called Queen, not Queen Bao.

There is a big difference between the queen and the queen treasure. The merit of the queen treasure is many times higher than that of other ordinary women.

Queen Bao's appearance is a hundred times more beautiful than ordinary women, and more beautiful than the goddess in the heavens.

Queen Bao's body can emit a very fragrant fragrance and float to a distance of one or two kilometers.

Wherever the Queen's Treasure goes, disasters can be eliminated, and any disease can be eliminated when encountering the Queen's Treasure.

The Queen's Treasure can expel demons. Wherever the Queen's Treasure goes, the demons can naturally be eliminated. Even writing a letter can exorcise demons. In some places, before the Queen's Treasure arrives, I write a letter: "So-and-so, so-and-so, you are not allowed. stay here."

The devil goes away immediately.

Those who have seen the Queen's Treasure are happy all their lives.

No matter how big the troubles are, as long as they see the Queen's Treasure, their troubles will naturally be suppressed.

The merits of the Queen's Treasure are very different from other queens.

We should make offerings to Buddhas and Bodhisattvas with the Queen's Treasure.

Minister Treasure The Minister Treasure refers to the ministers who can rule the four major earths. There is also a difference between the minister treasure and the minister. It is the minister treasure that we want to make offerings to Buddhas and Bodhisattvas.

Elephant treasure Elephant treasure is a celestial phenomenon, as big as a hill.

The power of this celestial elephant is greater than that of a thousand elephants. Its body is white in color and has six tusks. It can run around the earth once a day.

Ma Baobao is a kind of pegasus with a white body. It can run faster than 100 million ordinary horses. It can run around the earth three times a day, faster than our plane.

General Bao General Bao is the treasure of the Golden Wheel King.

When King Jinlun was there, there would not be any major wars, because with General Bao there, no one dared to fight.

If some people want to fight, when they think of the general treasure, they will be afraid and will not dare to fight.

General Bao has such power.

The seven offerings above are called the Seven Treasures.

The merits of each offering are different.

One of the most extraordinary offerings is called a giant vase.

Giant Tibetan Bottle The giant Tibetan bottle is a bottle as big as a mountain, and it contains various treasures.

Giant Tibetan bottle offering offerings to Buddhas and Bodhisattvas.

Then make offerings to eight goddesses. These are not ordinary goddesses, but very special goddesses.

The eight goddesses are not only found in Tibetan Buddhism, but also in Chinese Buddhism.

We went to Mount Wutai last year. There is a monastery on Mount Wutai called Foguang Temple. Foguang Temple is a monastery in the Tang Dynasty. The Buddha statues in the Mahavira Hall are well preserved. There are eight goddesses in front of the Buddha statue of Sakyamuni in the Mahavira Hall. That is, the goddess of the sky, the goddess of the sky, the goddess of singing, the goddess of dancing, the goddess of flowers, the goddess of burning incense, the goddess of light, and the goddess of painting incense.

Hippian Girl Hippian Girl With a smile on her face, she is very happy, no matter who sees her, she will be happy for a lifetime.

It is very common to hold the Hua Tiannv flower in the hands of ordinary people, but when you hold it in the hand of the Tiannv, the merits of the flower will be released, it will become a hundred times more beautiful, and the fragrance is also a hundred times better, and it is very good in every aspect. 's victory.

Getiannu Getiannu is not an ordinary goddess, she is a dakini, whoever hears the Dharma song sung by the goddess will be liberated.

When Master Tsongkhapa wrote the rituals of Vajra Vajra and the second stage of Vajra Vajra, many Dakinis came to sing Dharma songs, and he recorded them in writing.

Every word of these Dharma songs has a very special meaning, and anyone who hears it will be liberated.

Song Tian Nu is not an ordinary singer who sings. This must be distinguished and understood.

Any move of the dancing girl, the dancing girl, can open up the corresponding meridians in our body.

Tantra says that we have many tiny channels in our body.

All these channels must be merged into the central channel. Once the central channel is opened, it will naturally enter the emptiness and liberate.

The movements of the dancer dancing are called Fa dance. Every movement is a method to let the Qi fully integrate into the central meridian. Whoever sees the dancer dancing the Fa dance, his qi will naturally be integrated into the central channel, which is very special.

What kind of merit does Hua Tiannv have? All the merits of flowers in the hands of ordinary people cannot be released.

But once Hua Tiannv takes this flower in her hand, all its merits can be released.

It is a hundred times more beautiful than ordinary flowers, and its fragrance can travel far away. Only the flowers in the hands of Hua Tiannv have this merit.

So when offering flowers, why should we visualize the flower goddess coming to offer flowers? This is the reason.

Because this flower is different.

The incense burning goddess we are burning now, its merits cannot be released. If you put it in the hands of the burning incense goddess, and burn it, its incense will increase thousands of times. It is very, very incense, and it will become auspicious. Offering the Eight Treasures to Buddhas and Bodhisattvas is very special.

Let's light an oil lamp. It only has a small light, but it can't be separated from too much darkness.

If you put this small oil lamp in Deng Tiannv's hand, this little light will become as big as the rays of hundreds of suns, and all its merits will be released. Deng Tiannv has this ability.

So when offering the lamp, visualize the goddess of the lamp coming to take the lamp.

The esoteric method of tantra is a very convenient and very skillful method.

The lantern goddess offered this oil lamp as offerings, but it was different.

Tuxiang Tiannv is like other Tiannv, and the sandalwood perfume that Tuxiang Tiannv wears is very fragrant and fragrant.

Don't misunderstand these eight goddesses, you must understand.

In the past, I had a disciple from Han. She said that she was relatively poor and could not get wealth in her whole life, so she wanted to find a way to get wealth.

I said you go to Mandrak and gave her a Mandrak offering.

She took a look at the mantra offering text and said, "Oh, Master! How can you make offerings to the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas with singing and dancing girls? How can you feed these things? I don't offer this.

She didn't understand, that's why she said that.

This is where Mandza must explain.

Next is the sun, the moon, and the treasure umbrella, which deter the ten directions of the tower.

Mandra is the sun, and the sun also makes offerings to Buddhas and Bodhisattvas.

The moon is the moon, and the moon also makes offerings to Buddhas and Bodhisattvas.

Treasure umbrellas are large umbrellas made of various heavenly treasures, which are offered to Buddhas and Bodhisattvas.

This treasure umbrella can be a nine-layer umbrella, a ten-layer umbrella, or a multi-layer umbrella.

Some are flags and some are banners hanging in the Daxiong Hall of Deterrence Shifang Zunshengzhuang Temple.

There is a difference between the banner and the banner. The characteristic of the banner is that it has a logo with three very special and magical animals on it.

If there is this sign, it is called a banner; if it does not, it is called a banner.

These three extraordinary animals are the eight-legged lion king, the otter fish, and the naga fish.

The eight-legged, winged lion is called the Eight-legged Lion King; the otter fish has otter hair on its body; the Naga fish has a head like a crocodile and a tail like a conch shell.

129

In this way, all the thirty-seven offerings of Mandha are available.

Mount Sumeru, East Shengshenzhou, South Zhanbuzhou, West Niuhezhou, North Juluzhou, Shenzhou, Shengshenzhou, Fuzhou, Bifuzhou, Xiaoxingzhou, Shengdaoxingzhou, Juluzhou, Youshenglu Zhou, Baoshan King, Ruyi Tree, Desire-filled Cow, Natural Rice, Wheel Treasure, Ruyi Treasure, Queen Treasure, Minister Treasure, Elephant Treasure, Horse Treasure, General Treasure, Giant Treasure Vase, Hippian Girl, Raven Girl, Song Tien Girl, Dancer The goddess, the goddess of flowers, the goddess of burning incense, the goddess of lanterns, the goddess of painting incense, the sun, the moon, and the umbrella, intimidating the ten directions of the towers, a total of thirty-seven.

Thirty-seven offerings Mandha means thirty-seven offerings.

In the center of Manzha, all the gods and people are pure and auspicious, the treasures of perfection are everywhere, and in the universe, you can imagine that the jewels in the world and the jewels in the sky are all offered to Buddhas and Bodhisattvas.

There are countless seas of boundless dust, solemnly enumerating and visualizing each offering as an infinite number, such as Mount Sumeru, which can be visualized as countless number of Mount Sumeru offering offerings to Buddhas and Bodhisattvas.

East Sacred Body Continent, South Zhan Bu Continent, every earth can make offerings, visualize hundreds of hundreds of billions or even countless universes, and visualize them in this way to make offerings to Buddhas and Bodhisattvas.

So this is called the sea of ​​countless boundless dust.

The guru, the deity, the Three Jewels, the guru to be offered here, mainly refers to one's own root guru and lineage guru.

The lineage guru refers to the guru's guru, all the way up to Shakyamuni Buddha.

The deity is the deity of the four tantras: the deity of the supreme yoga class is the five great vajras of the tantra: Victory Vajra, Dense Vajra, Kalachakra, Mahavira, and Hevajra. These deities of the supreme yoga class must be offered.

The deity of the Yoga Department includes the Great Sun Tathagata, etc., as well as many deity Buddhas, all of which must be offered.

The deity of the Xingbu is Vairocana Bodhi Buddha, etc. There are many Buddhas and Bodhisattvas, and many deities and Buddhas, and they all have to make offerings.

There are many deities of Shibu. Twenty-one Tara, Manjushri, Avalokitesvara, and God of Wealth are all belonging to Shibu deity and can be offered to these deities.

The Three Jewels are Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha.

The Buddha is the Buddha Tathagata, the Buddha Tathagata of the ten directions and three times.

The law is the teaching and the proof.

Sangha is the protector of all bodhisattvas, arahants and supramundanes.

The three treasures must be offered.

This is what Mandha offered.

To pray for the benefit of all beings with compassion, to receive the blessings that have been prayed for is to pray to Buddhas, Bodhisattvas, the Guru, the Three Jewels, to benefit all beings, and to accept these offerings.

After accepting it, give me and other sentient beings the blessings of body, speech, and mind.

3. The merits of Mandha Thirty-seven offerings are the merits of each offering of Mandha.

Every offering has a common result, which is to gain wealth.

Different offerings also have different results.

For example, if you make offerings to thirteen earths, you will not only get wealth, but also property; if you make offerings to the King of Baoshan, Ruyi Tree, and Ruyi Treasures, you will not only get wealth, but also your wishes; if you make offerings to cravings, you will not only get wealth, but also health; making offerings to natural rice , not only to obtain wealth, but also to have good wishes without labor; to make offerings to the wheel treasure, you can get incredible merits, and in Buddhist terms, you can teach sutras and teach the Dharma; make offerings to the seven treasures, you can be promoted, and if you spread the Dharma, you can achieve the position of Dharma King; make offerings to the queen Treasures, not only get wealth, but also happiness; make offerings to ministers, not only get wealth, but also open up wisdom; make offerings to elephants, not only get wealth, but also encounter Mahayana Buddhism; make offerings to horses, not only get wealth, but also do things very well.

After the lamp is offered, the eyes gradually get better; offering to the goddess of incense and incense, not only will you get wealth, but the precepts are very pure; offering the sun, not only wealth, but also great wisdom and emptiness wisdom; offering to the moon, not only wealth, but also Bodhicitta; making offerings to the umbrella will not only gain wealth, but also easily reduce one's troubles; 133 making offerings to banners will not only gain wealth, but also gain great authority.

These are all offerings, and each offering has different merits. The merits of the thirty-seven offerings are finished.

Four and seven offerings to Mandha

The seven offerings are very simple. The offerings are Mount Sumeru, the four continents (East Shengshen Continent, South Zhanbu Continent, West Niu He Continent, and North Julu Continent), sun and moon.

Offering these seven offerings is called the Seven Offering Mantra.

This ritual is:

The earth is covered with fragrant flowers

Sumeru is surrounded by the sun and the moon

Willingness to make offerings to the buddhas

Climbing to the Pure Land and praying for use

It is to visualize that the earth is covered with a very fragrant and fragrant layer of incense. Every earth is coated with this incense, and many different flowers are placed. Visualize Mount Sumeru, the four continents, the sun and the moon making offerings to Buddhas and Bodhisattvas. The entire universe makes offerings to Buddhas and Bodhisattvas.

This is the Seven Offering Mandrak.

After the seven offerings of Mandra are completed, the Mantra Mantra shall be recited: Mandra Odanggu Rana Mandra Gonnyadayami This mantra means that I will offer the purest universe to the guru, the Three Jewels, "Firm Such as" is the meaning of guru.

Fifth, how to repair Manza.

First, let's talk about the method of Manzapan repair.

Everyone knows this is called Manzapan.

The empty space below the Manza disk represents the boundless giant tornado when the universe began to form, and the disk above represents the golden foundation of extremely pure freedom.

When making offerings to the Mandra, the left hand must take some offerings, such as gold and silver jewelry, various precious stones, or five grains, etc., and then hold it by the side of the Mandra, and then grab some offerings with the right hand, and rub the Mandra with the Bodhi pulse of the right hand. .

There are two methods for wiping the Manzapan: The first method: Wipe clockwise three times.

The meaning of rubbing it three times is that the first time is to wipe off the afflictions of sentient beings in the six realms, the second time is to wipe away the knowledge obstacles of sentient beings in the six realms, and the third time is to wipe off the habits of sentient beings in the six realms.

Wipe away all bad habits.

The second method:

Rub clockwise twice, then counterclockwise twice.

When rubbing outside (clockwise) for the first time, visualize wiping away all the unclean, impure things from the entire universe.

When rubbing it outside (clockwise) for the second time, visualize the afflictions and knowledge obstacles of all beings in the six realms in the universe, and wipe off all the bad things; when rubbing it inside (counterclockwise) for the first time, arouse If you can get the Buddha's Dharma body, you will know everything.

When you rub it inside (counterclockwise) a second time, you will be able to get the Buddha's physical body (retribution body or incarnation).

Just like that.

You can choose from the above two methods.

After wiping, start reciting: "Om Ban Za Po Mi A Hum", place the offering held by the right hand in the center of the Mandra plate, and visualize each offering becoming an earth. "

Extremely clean and free golden foundation, Om Banzareka ah hum, surrounded by Tiewei Mountain outside", the largest circle represents Tiewei Mountain, placed on the Manza plate, this is the first floor, read "The center is the king of the mountain" Victory over Mount Sumeru," while grabbing some offerings with his right hand and placing them in the middle of the Mandza plate.

There are as many grains of rice as there are in the visualization as many Mount Sumeru, or as one Mount Sumeru. "

"East Saint Body Continent", the four directions of east, west, northwest, identify the side of one's body as east or the opposite side of oneself as east, but the usual practice is to identify the side of one's body as east.

When it's settled, place offerings in the east when reciting "Dongshengshenzhou"; "Southern Zhanbuzhou" to the south; "Xiniu Hezhou" to the west; "North Juluzhou" to the north; "Shenzhou, Shengshenzhou" Put it on the left and right sides of Dongshengshenzhou; "Fuzhou, don't Fuzhou" put it on the upper and lower sides of Nanzhanbuzhou; "Xiaoxingzhou, Shengdaoxingzhou" on the right and left sides of Xiniu Hezhou; "Juluzhou, there is Shenglu Continent" is placed on the bottom, top, and sides of Beijuluzhou.

All jewels placed are visualized as the earth.

After the thirteen earths are visualized, the "Baoshan Wang" is placed in the east, and as soon as the offerings are released, many Baoshan Wangs come out; the "Wishful Tree" is placed in the south;

This is the first way (there are three ways in total).

The second method is to make offerings to the seven treasures: the "Lunbao" is the east side, the "Wishful Treasure" is the south side, the "Queen's Treasure" is the west side, the "Minister's Treasure" is the north side, and the "Elephant Treasure" is the north side. " is the southeast, "Ma Bao" is the southwest, "General Treasure" is the northwest, and "Ju Zangbo" is the northeast.

The first floor is full here.

The second layer is put up, and then "Hip Tiannv" is the east side, "Rang Tiannv" is the south side, "Sing Tiannv" is the west side, "Dancing Tiannv" is the north side, "Flower Tiannv" is the southeast, and "Burning Incense Tiannv" is the west In the south, "Deng Tiannv" is the northwest, and "Tuxiang Tiannv" is the northeast.

Here, the second floor is full.

Next, put the third floor on top, with "Sun" being the east side, "Moon" being the west side, "Treasure Umbrella" being the south side, and "Mighty Ten Directions Zunsheng Building" being the north side.

In this way, the third layer is full.

"In the center of Manzha, all heaven and man are pure and auspicious, the treasure of perfection" and finally put the top tower on it.

"Immeasurable and boundless dust, as many seas, are solemnly listed, and the guru deity, the Three Jewels, make offerings, and I pray for mercy to benefit all people and accept them. I have prayed for blessings."

Then the top pavilion was taken down and offered seven offerings to the mandra, "The earth is covered with fragrant flowers and brocades, and the sun and moon are all around Xumi. 138 Mandra's intention is to make offerings to all Buddha temples, and everyone climbs the pure land to pray and benefit." Put the building on it, and when you recite this Mantra Mantra, "Odang is as strong as Rena Mandala Gunya Dayami", sprinkle the jewels, this is a very complete offering.

After the offering is over, you can keep it in the Buddhist hall and keep offering it, or you can take it down every day to offer it, but when you take it down, don’t pour it out.

After completing the thirty-seven offerings of mandras, make seven offerings of mandras.

Grasp the jewelry with the left hand and take the manza plate, and grasp the jewelry with the right hand and wipe it out (clockwise) three times, or twice clockwise and twice counterclockwise. "

The earth is covered with fragrant flowers and brocades, the sun and the moon are all around Xumi, and the intention is to make offerings to the Buddhas, and everyone climbs the pure land to pray and benefit." At the same time, the right hand is placed in the center, east, south, west, north, east, west, seven Place the jewels in one direction; "Odang is as strong as Rena Manzara Gunya Dayami", and at the same time sprinkle some jewels on the Manza plate, and then pour it in front of his body.

Thirty-seven mantras cannot be done 100,000 times, but seven mantras can be made 139,000 times.

In the past, Master Tsongkhapa offered thirty-seven offerings to the Mandra a million times.

We make the seven offerings of the Mandrak 100,000 times, very simple, that's it.

When Master Tsongkhapa rubbed the mandra plate, the skin on his right hand was torn off and bleeding.

When rubbing Mantra, you must use the pulse of your right hand to rub, this pulse is called the Bodhi pulse.

If this bodhi channel is rubbed regularly, it will be easy to obtain compassion and bodhicitta.

If you smoke, the bodhicitta will be blocked, and it will be difficult to arouse bodhicitta. Smoking is really a lot of sins.

The third way, when the "natural rice" is offered, the first floor is full, and the second floor is added. Bao" is the north, "Xiangbao" is the southwest, "Mabao" is the northwest, "General Treasure" is the northeast, "Juzangbo" is the southeast, "Xi Tiannv" is the east, "Rang Tiannv" is the south, "Song" is the southeast. "Tiannv" is west, "Dancing" is north, "Flower" is southeast, "Burning Incense" is southwest, "Lantern" is northwest, and "Turning Incense" is northeast, so the second floor is full.

140

Manzha is then placed on the third floor, the "sun" is east, the "moon" is west, the "treasure umbrella" is south, the "prestigious tower of the ten directions" is north, and "all the heavens and people in the center of Manzha are pure and auspicious, and they are perfect. Treasures" and finally put the top tower on it, "Immeasurable and boundless dust and countless seas, solemnly listed, the guru deity three treasures make offerings, pray for mercy and benefit all people and accept it, and receive blessings that have been prayed for." Then, the top tower was taken down, It is also possible to make seven consecutive offerings of mandras, or thirty-seven offerings of mandras and seven offerings of mandras in a row, and then to offer seven mandras all the time.

Each jewel is visualized as a separate offering.

When offering offerings to each continent, each jewel is visualized as the earth; when offering offerings to the King of Baoshan, every jewel is visualized as the King of Baoshan.

Visualize what you offer, and only then will you offer it well.

The manza plate cannot be empty. The manza plate must be placed with the offerings, and cannot be separated from the offerings. Even if it is only a little bit, it must be placed.

Manza finished.

Good luck everyone!

141

Practice Mantra together: recite "Heart Sutra" once, "Recite Sutra often" once, "Longevity Prayer for Ngawang Gyatso Vajra Master" once, "Seven Branch Offerings" three times, "Guru Yoga" ( Read "The Holy Spirit will be revealed for a long time") once.

I am an ignorant and ignorant person who breaks vows and breaks all precepts. The guru, the Three Jewels, saves and protects. The deity, Sasam Vajradhara, has a vast body of compassion. Cleaned up and eliminated, this deity enters my body, speech, and mind.

Pariṇāmanā

May this merit spread to all

I and all sentient beings will achieve Buddhahood together.

Vajrasattva
Please arouse Bodhicitta and listen carefully!

To practice Vajrasattva, you need to understand: Vajrasattva, taking refuge, visualizing Vajrasattva, one-hundred-syllable mantra, repentance, and dedication.

1. Vajrasattva

There are two kinds of Vajrasattva.

One is the single-practice Vajrasattva, which is the deity of the Yoga Department; the other is the double-practice Vajrasattva, which is the deity of the Supreme Yoga Department.

The Vajrasattva we practice is a deity belonging to the Supreme Yoga Division.

The inheritance of Vajrasattva of double cultivation is only available in the Gelug School, but not in other schools.

This was passed down by Manjushri to Master Tsongkhapa himself, and Master Tsongkhapa passed it on to Kezhujie, and it was passed down slowly. Therefore, this inheritance is only available to the Gelug School.

The purest and most complete lineage among the other schools, the Gelug School has, while the Gelug School has some lineages that the other schools do not have.

For example, the Vajrasattva of the Supreme Yoga Department is unique to the Gelug School, and its mantra is a hundred-syllable mantra.

The mantra of Vajrasattva of the Yoga Department has only 100 characters, while the one-hundred-syllable mantra of Vajrasattva of the Supreme Yoga Department has 102 characters, that is, the two words "Hum" and "Bah" are added at the end. Character.

Vajrasattva of Supreme Yoga can eliminate all sins and karma.

The Vajrasattva of the Yoga Department, that is, the Vajrasattva of the single practice, can eliminate the obstacles to breaking precepts below the Yoga Department, including the karma of doing the ten evil karma, but the karma of the Vajrayana precepts of the Supreme Yoga Department can not be eliminated. , because he is the deity of Yoga.

If the karmic hurdles caused by the broken precepts of the supreme yoga group are to be eliminated, only the deity of the supreme yoga group can be eliminated, and none of the others can be eliminated.

The karma of the ten evil karma, such as the karma that both those who learn Buddhism and those who do not learn Buddhism, can be eliminated by reciting the Thirty-Five Buddhas Repentance and other scriptures.

Including committing the five uninterrupted sins, that is, killing the father, killing the mother, killing an arahant, giving birth to the body and blood of a Buddha, breaking the karma of reconciling with the Sangha, and reciting the thirty-five Buddha repentance texts can also be eliminated.

When Master Tsongkhapa was practicing in Vokachelong, Tibet, Master Tsongkhapa recited the thirty-five Buddha repentance texts, and did prostrations one hundred thousand times while reciting.

After 100,000 recitations, the ten evil karma and other serious sins were all eliminated, thirty-five Buddhas appeared in person, and Master Tsongkhapa saw thirty-five Buddhas with his own eyes.

Master Tsongkhapa is the incarnation of Manjushri.

Why do it? Those of us who study with him should do this. This is an expression, and it is the standard for us to practice the Fa.

Therefore, whether it is the Kadam School or the Gelug School, they should recite the thirty-five Buddha repentance texts at night, once or three times, and then go to sleep.

If you go to sleep without reciting, your masters will say, "You have no sin? You have no karma? You just sleep like this?" Very strict.

The merits of the thirty-five Buddhas' repentance texts are explained in Jia Caojie's writings, and the merits are extremely great.

Therefore, Master Tsongkhapa attaches great importance to the thirty-five Buddha's repentance in the aspect of eliminating karmic obstacles in the Dharma.

In the tantric sect, there are four deities in the esoteric sect. In the deity of Shibu, the mantra of the Buddha of the Buddha and the heart mantra of Guanyin Bodhisattva are the most important ones in the deity of Shibu. It can only eliminate the relapse karma below the Ministry of affairs, and cannot eliminate the karma of relapsed karma above the deity of the Ministry of affairs.

Because Guanyin Bodhisattva is the deity of Shibu.

After receiving the empowerment of the deity of Shibu, there are also precepts, which are the precepts of the bodhisattva.

If you break the bodhisattva precepts, you can get rid of it by reciting the Great Compassion Mantra, and you can also get rid of it by reciting "Om Mani Pami Hum", but you can't get rid of it if you break the tantric precepts of the Supreme Yoga Department.

When it came to the deity of the lineage, Tsongkhapa attached great importance to Vairocana Bodhi Buddha.

In the deity of the Yoga Department, great importance is attached to the Great Sun Tathagata.

The Yoga Department also has Vajrasattva, which is a single image of Vajrasattva, and also has a hundred-character mantra, which ends with the word "A".

The Vajrasattva of the Yoga Department can only eliminate the sins of breaking precepts below the Yoga Department. The ten evil karma, the five uninterrupted sins and other karma can be eliminated, but the karma of the Supreme Yoga Department who has broken the Tantric precepts cannot be eliminated.

Vajrasattva of the double body is the deity of the Supreme Yoga Department, which can eliminate all karmic obstacles, including all karmic obstacles that break the precepts of the four tantric schools.

The blessings of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas are great, as are the blessings of teachers, but why can’t we get this blessing? Our karma is very heavy, and the karma tightly shuts the door of body, speech, and mind, so the blessings cannot get in.

After our karmic hurdles are reduced, blessings can easily enter our body, speech, and mind.

After the blessings of the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas and the blessings of the guru are obtained, the practice will be very relaxed, not so depressed or distressed, and it will be easier to cultivate in.

Which Dharma door is cultivated is full of Dharma joy, very happy, and happy when reciting sutras all day long.

When you don’t get the blessings, your voice will become hoarse after reciting a little sutra, then your mind will be very troubled and your body will feel uncomfortable.

The biggest karmic obstacle is slandering the guru. If you want to eliminate this karmic obstacle, you must visualize the sameness of Vajrasattva and the teacher. Only then can it be eliminated. Even the like Vajrasattva cannot eliminate this karma.

Once you have visualized that your guru and Vajrasattva are indistinguishable from each other, and then recite the one-hundred-syllable mantra, even the karma of slandering your guru can be eliminated, and nothing else needs to be said.

The precepts of the supreme tantric vehicle have fourteen fundamental precepts, breaking one precept will lead to hell, let alone breaking all fourteen fundamental precepts.

If the eight branches of Tantra are broken, they will all go to hell.

So what to do? Reciting Vajrasattva can eliminate all the karma of broken precepts.

We must understand that even if one of the fourteen root precepts is purified, the blessings will be enormous.

One of the eighteen fundamental precepts of the bodhisattva precepts is purified and the reward is great.

If half of the precepts are broken and half of the precepts are purified, the blessings will be great, but the karma will also be heavy.

When the retribution comes out, whichever is heavier will come out first.

Some people have great blessings, but when the karma is even bigger, the bad rewards of the karma come out first, and the bad rewards such as illness, short life, bankruptcy, etc. will appear.

Although the karma is very heavy, when the blessing is greater, the good reward will come out first.

When good deeds come out, you will be in good health, wealth and longevity, and your wishes will be fulfilled.

But that doesn't mean there is no karma.

At this time, you should recite the scriptures carefully to eliminate all karma.

Good and evil karma depends on the severity.

The ones with the heaviest karma come out first; if the karma is the same, the pretentious ones come out first; if these are the same, then whichever good or bad karma comes out of your mind first, comes out first, especially before death.

Especially a person who is a regular drinker will only think of the evil karma he has created before he dies. At this time, he regrets it very much, but it is too late. He blames himself and hates himself very much, and the power of hatred will bring him to hell.

So let's repent! Even if the karma cannot be completely eliminated, at least it must be eliminated a little smaller than the blessing, so that it will not be able to come out temporarily. After blocking it with the blessing, we will continue to accumulate the blessing and continue to repent, and the karma will be eliminated. It gets smaller and smaller and eventually disappears.

Don't underestimate karma and good fortune, even a little bit will increase every day.

Your accumulated blessings will increase every day, and your karma will also increase every day.

As long as there is a little bit of it left, the retribution will definitely come out.

How to eliminate the good news? Anger and jealousy will take away the good news.

To eliminate karmic obstacles, recite Vajrasattva, and repentance can eliminate karmic obstacles.

Therefore, Vajrasattva of the Supreme Yoga Department is the top priority of the Gelug School! This is very very important! Reciting it one hundred thousand times, together with visualization, will definitely eliminate all karmic obstacles.

After the karmic obstacles are eliminated, the blessings of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas will continue to integrate into you, and it will be easy to achieve after obtaining the blessings.

When practicing the Vajrasattva of the Supreme Yoga Department, that is, the Vajrasattva of the double body image, one should visualize that the master and the double body image of Vajrasattva are indistinguishable.

The Hundred-character Mantra is the heart mantra of Vajrasattva, the master mantra and the heart mantra of all Buddhas and Tathagatas.

The merits of reciting the Hundred-character Mantra, the merits of Amitabha, the merits of the Great Compassion Mantra, the merits of reciting the Heart Sutra, and the merits of reciting the Earth Store Sutra will all have the merits.

Because you have visualized the guru and the double image of Vajrasattva as one and the same.

Whether you cultivate the Fa well or not depends entirely on this heart.

If one wishes to repent, sincerely repent, visualize Vajrasattva and recite the Hundred-syllable Mantra.

If the belief is correct, the practice of the Dharma in an instant will accumulate a lot of blessings and eliminate a lot of karma.

If you just visualize the Vajrasattva without visualizing the Vajrasattva and the guru indistinguishably, the ability to eliminate karmic obstacles will not be great.

If the guru and Vajrasattva are visualized indistinguishably, the ability to eliminate karmic obstacles will be very strong.

If the four deities, the Buddhas and Tathagatas, the bodhisattvas, the masters, and the Vajrasattva are all visualized without distinction, the ability to eliminate karma will be very, very powerful.

Reciting the Vajrasattva mantra once or reciting the hundred-syllable mantra once can eliminate countless karmic obstacles.

The hundred-syllable mantra can be recited without empowerment.

There are two kinds of visualization: one is the visualization of self-esteem, that is, visualization of oneself as Vajrasattva, which requires empowerment before visualization.

The other is the visualization of the deity of the image. The deity of the image is visualized on the opposite side or on the top of the head. The person who has not received the empowerment can also visualize it, as long as he has the oral transmission of the Vajrasattva or the oral transmission of the hundred-syllable mantra That's fine, you don't have to be empowered.

Second, take refuge

All Buddhas, Wonderful Dharma, Zhongzun and even Bodhi, I take refuge
I give all kinds of resources to save sentient beings and wish to become a Buddha
First, take refuge in the Three Jewels of the Guru.

To take refuge in the Guru Three Jewels, visualize the lotus throne in the sky, visualize the Vajrasattva, which is indistinguishable from the Guru, in the lotus throne, and visualize the four deities, Buddhas and Tathagatas, Bodhisattvas, and transcendent Dharma protectors around the Vajrasattva. god.

Then recite the Four Refugees three times, and after reciting it, the Bodhicitta will arouse.

When arousing bodhicitta, recite "The Buddhas, the Wonderful Dharma, the Congregation, and even Bodhi, I take refuge".

"All Buddhas and Wonderful Dharmas are among the most respected", and "all Buddhas" are all Buddhas.

"Wonderful Dharma" is 84,000 Dharma doors.

"Zhongzun" is the Sangha, including Bodhisattvas, Arahants, and Dharma protectors.

The most honorable among all living beings is the Sangha - "the most respected among all".

"I take refuge in Bodhi", which means taking refuge until attaining Buddhahood.

"Taking refuge in the guru, taking refuge in the Buddha, taking refuge in the Dharma, and taking refuge in the Sangha" are the separate refuges of the Three Jewels, and what we are talking about is the refuge of the Three Jewels together.

"I practice all kinds of alms, and I wish to become a Buddha in order to save sentient beings." This is to generate Bodhicitta.

"I practice all kinds of resources such as giving", our current behavior is the behavior of the Bodhisattva, and the practice of the Bodhisattva.

Bodhisattvas have many deeds. Generally speaking, they are the six perfections, that is, "giving and others", that is, the six perfections of generosity, precepts, patience, diligence, meditation, and wisdom paramita.

Accomplishments are blessings, the blessings of taking refuge in the Three Jewels, the blessings of giving, the blessings of diligence, the blessings of prajna wisdom, and the blessings of practicing meditation.

What do you do with these blessings and resources? "I wish to become a Buddha in order to save sentient beings." In order to save sentient beings, I want to become a Buddha myself.

This is the heart of generating Bodhicitta and becoming a Buddha.

This is how to generate bodhicitta three times. After generating bodhicitta, because the arousal is very good, the power of reciting any sutra will be very, very powerful! The three important aspects of practice are to initiate, visualize, and dedicate.

That is to say, the practice has to go through three stages: the beginning, the middle, and the latter: the most important thing at the beginning is the intention, the important thing in the middle is the recitation of the ritual or the visualization, and the last important thing is the dedication.

First of all, get excited.

When chanting sutras and practicing, it is very important to have the initial intention.

If chanting is only for the health of one's own child, then this kind of motivation is very small.

For example, some people "recite a day's scriptures for her daughter because she is sick".

For the sake of his daughter, it is a small blessing to recite the Ksitigarbha scriptures for her.

If I think of a disaster in a certain place or place, I want to recite the sutra to eliminate the disaster. If there are a thousand people in this place, your blessing will increase a thousand times, and reciting it once is equal to reciting it a thousand times.

If there are 10,000 people in this place, it is equivalent to reciting Vajrasattva 10,000 times, and reciting Vajrasattva once for 10,000 sentient beings is equivalent to reciting Vajrasattva 10,000 times.

When you want to recite the scriptures, if you think that I am reading scriptures for all human beings, it is not clear how many human beings really are. There are more than seven billion people in Nanzhanbuzhou, Xiniu Hezhou, Beijuluzhou, Dongshengshen There will be many people in continents and other continents.

If you recite the scriptures for all these people, the merits will be great.

Reciting sutras for sentient beings in the six realms brings great blessings.

Among the six realms, the most are hell beings, and the least among the six realms are human beings. The realm of heaven is more than the realm of human beings, the realm of asura is more than the realm of heaven, the realm of beasts is more than the realm of Asura, the realm of hungry ghosts is more than the realm of animals, the realm of hell is more than the realm of hungry ghosts. There are countless beings.

When we recite sutras and practice, we recite sutras and practice for the sake of all sentient beings, then this blessing is a boundless blessing.

Reciting sutras and practicing in order to become Buddhas in the six realms, the blessings are infinite blessings.

Because the merits of Buddha are infinite.

The blessings of chanting and practicing in order to become an arahant are limited.

Because the merits of an arahant are limited.

So it's important to have a heart.

For the sake of sentient beings in the six realms or for the permanent existence of the Dharma, the merits of reciting sutras and practicing are very great.

Because the Dharma can benefit all living beings, the Dharma is immeasurable and boundless, and the merits have become immeasurable and boundless.

It is very important to have the heart in everything, that is to say, it is very important to have the heart in everything.

May all sentient beings be full of happiness and happiness. May all sentient beings be free from suffering and suffering. May all sentient beings never be separated from the wonderful happiness without suffering. May all sentient beings stay away from love, hatred, relatives, and friends. Four immeasurable hearts.

"May all sentient beings be full of happiness and the causes of happiness." The happiness here is peace, joy, and happiness.

The causes of happiness are the ten good precepts, practice of the Dharma, taking refuge, reciting sutras, and so on.

May all beings find happiness and the cause of happiness.

160 Vajrasattva This is loving-kindness.

"May all sentient beings be free from suffering and its causes." Suffering here is suffering and affliction.

Suffering has the suffering of living beings in the six realms, especially the suffering of the three evil realms. I hope all living beings will be free from suffering and afflictions.

The causes of affliction are afflictions and karma, and afflictions have six root afflictions and twenty secondary afflictions.

The karma includes the ten evil karma, the karma of breaking the precepts, the karma created by the body, speech and mind, and so on.

May all beings be free from troubles and karma forever.

This is compassion.

Compassion is important.

The essence of Mahayana Buddhism is great compassion.

"May all sentient beings never lose the wonderful bliss without suffering", this is the heart of joy.

Undrained happiness is bliss, eternal happiness.

Eternal happiness refers to happiness that never disappears, never suffers.

All sentient beings want to obtain wonderful happiness, so we must send this heart, and may they obtain wonderful happiness and never be lost.

"May all sentient beings stay away from love, hatred, closeness and acquaintance, and live in equality and equanimity." Our beings are very attached. When we think that this person is our relatives and friends, we will have a lot of greed. If we think that this person is my enemy, we will have a lot of hatred. If we let go of greed and hatred, we will be very comfortable.

If you give up greed and hatred, there will be no pressure. The pressure is suppressed by these two afflictions.

When there is anger, it is very uncomfortable, and when there is greed, it is very uncomfortable, so let go of these two afflictions.

Don't be greedy for relatives and friends, and don't have hatred for enemies.

In fact, relatives and friends and enemies are equal, there is no eternal relatives and friends, and there is no eternal enemy.

Today's relatives and friends will become tomorrow's enemies, and today's enemies will also become tomorrow's relatives and friends. This is the impermanence of the six realms of reincarnation we are in.

Friends and foes have changed a lot. All sentient beings are equal and should be treated with equality.

So always let go.

Taking refuge in the Three Jewels of Buddhism, Dharma and Sangha

I'm free from everything

Xianling lived in peace and victorious Bodhi

Sincerely initiate Bodhicitta

This is bodhicitta. There are two types of bodhicitta: one is the wish to be a bodhichitta, wishing to become a Buddha for all people; the other is to practice the bodhichitta, which is not just a vow, but a practice of generosity, precepts and so on.

Our retreat now is to do it in action.

Some people just think, "I want to become a Buddha, I want to become a Buddha..." But they don't take action, and it's not very useful! In order to become a Buddha and practice, the motivation is very important, so I have talked so much about the motivation.

In addition, when cultivating Vajrasattva, the special intention is that in order to save sentient beings in the six realms, in order to obtain the fruit status of Vajrasattva, one must recite the hundred-syllable mantra when cultivating Vajrasattva.

3. Visualize Vajrasattva.

On the top of one's head, visualize the word "Wan", which turns into an eight-petaled lotus flower, the word "A" in the middle turns into a moon wheel, and the word "Hung" grows on the moon wheel. The hum character, the hum character emits light to benefit others, the immeasurable rays of light enter the hum character, and the hum character becomes the Vajrasattva.

For those without empowerment, visualize the word "Bay" on the top of their head.

For those who have empowerment, while visualizing the word "Bay" on the top of their head, their body is emptiness, and the word "Bay" is also visualized on the position of the body, which turns into an eight-petal lotus.

Visualize the word "ah" in the middle of the lotus, and the word "ah" turns into a moon wheel.

The moon wheel is a round, flat moon. On the moon wheel, visualize a "Hu" character, which turns into a white vajra.

The upper part of the abdomen is marked with the character "Hung", and the upper part of the abdomen of the vajra, which is the middle of the vajra, should also visualize the character "Hung".

The word "Hu" shines for self-interest and altruism.

This is very important. The word "Hu" on the abdomen emits immeasurable light. On the light, visualize the auspicious eight treasures, seven treasures, eight offerings, etc., all kinds of countless offerings, appear in the light, and make offerings to the guru and the three treasures. , this can accumulate a lot of good fortune.

Then this light shoots out and shines on all beings in the six realms, and all the karma of the six realms is eliminated.

All sentient beings became Vajrasattva.

Making offerings to the guru's Three Jewels is self-interest, and eliminating the karma of sentient beings in the six realms is altruism.

The immeasurable rays of light enter the word "Hu", and all the rays of light that are emitted are taken back and melted into the word "Hu" on the abdomen of the vajra.

Then the vajra on the abdomen with the word "Hung" becomes Vajrasattva in an instant.

The body is white with one side and two arms, with a bell in the left hand and a pestle in the right hand. The Vajra Buddha mother has a beautiful face and a white body. She sits in a lotus position with a bell in her left hand. Invite, all the Buddhas will be transformed into Vajrasattva, piercing, humming, waning, and merging into one.

The hums in the heart beckon, and all the Buddhas of the Tathagata are empowered, and I pray for the empowerment of Vajrasattva.

Vajrasattva's body is white, with one side and two arms, holding a bell in the left hand and a pestle in the right hand.

There are two kinds of this lineage. One is that the Buddha's mother holds a kabala in her left hand and a yakuza in her right hand.

Our lineage is another, that is, holding a vajra bell in one hand and a vajra pestle in the other.

The great treasure is decorated with all kinds of solemnities, that is, the Buddha's father and mother have many jewel necklaces, bracelets, anklets, etc. on the body. The Buddha's father is sitting in a double-crossed posture, which is different from the lotus-shaped seat of the Buddha's mother.

The word "Hung" in the heart glows and invites, and all the Buddhas are transformed into Vajrasattva.

It is the word "Hung" in the mantra wheel of Vajrasattva that emits boundless light, welcoming all Buddhas and Tathagatas and Bodhisattvas, and inviting the Guru and the Three Jewels together, and turning them into Vajrasattva in the process of inviting them.

"Zha", "Hung", "Wan" and "Ha" are integrated into one, "Zha" reaches the top of Vajrasattva's head, "Hung" is integrated, and "Wan" is indistinguishable. Ha" is how long you can visualize it, and how long it will melt into your body.

The word "Hung" in the heart glows and invites, and all the Buddhas of the Tathagata are empowered.

That is, all the Tathagatas, especially the Buddhas of the five directions, have invited Vajrasattva to empower Vajrasattva.

By praying for the empowerment of Vajrasattva, I become Vajrasattva, and Vajrasattva is myself, my own deity.

Those who have not received empowerment, pray to Vajrasattva for empowerment, which is the empowerment of the opposite deity.

On the top of Vajrasattva's head, visualize the Buddhas, Tathagatas and the Buddhas of the five directions, and recite the empowerment mantra: 166 Vajrasattva Om Sawada Takada Abaihegada Samaya Xiri Yi Hung

The whole body of this deity is full of nectar, and the nectar of the top door cannot be changed into a Buddha.

I pray that all sentient beings in the six realms will be completely eliminated from all sins.

When the Buddhas of the five directions recited the empowerment mantra, they took the aquarium to empower them, and sprinkled nectar water on the body of the Vajrasattva above our heads to cleanse the deity.

If there is a Vajrasattva empowerment, the nectar water is sprinkled on the opposite deity and the self deity to cleanse.

If there is no empowerment, the whole body of the corresponding deity Vajrasattva is filled with nectar water, and a drop of nectar water overflows from the top of the head, and the nectar of the top door cannot become a Buddha.

If there is empowerment, the body of the opposite deity and the self deity is filled with nectar water, a drop of the nectar water overflows from the top of the head, and the nectar water on the top door of the opposite deity and the self deity becomes an immovable Buddha.

The immovable Tathagata Buddha has one face and two arms, a pestle in his right hand, a bell in his left hand, embraces the mudra with both hands, and sits with his legs crossed.

I pray that all sentient beings in the six realms will be completely eradicated.

I want to pray to Vajrasattva that all the sins of me and all beings in the six realms will be completely eradicated. I pray like this.

After praying, Vajrasattva's body emits immeasurable light, and in each light there is a double-figure Vajrasattva to save sentient beings in the six realms.

4. The Hundred-character Mantra:

Om Banzarsa Samaymani Bharaya Banzaersa Tinowad Chakzhi Jumei Bawasud Doha Yome Bawasupo Poha Yome Bawa Anoja Dome Bawasawas Dime Zaya Zha Sarwa Karma Su Zha Mai Zi as a wash day to raise Gu Ru hum ha ha ha ha Hu Bha Gawa Sa Ri Wada Ta Gada Ban Zha Er Mami Men Zha Ban Zha Er Bawa Ma Hasa There are seven types of visualizations of the Hundred-syllable Mantra of Ma Yasattva and Vajrasattva: the lower row to eliminate karma; the upper row to eliminate karma;埵.

(1) Eliminate karmic obstacles down

The first is lower row visualization, in which obstacles are expelled from under the practitioner's body.

When reciting the Vajrasattva Hundred-Symbol Mantra, visualize the moon plate in the heart of Vajrasattva, a "Hum" character in the middle of the moon plate, and the mantra of Vajrasattva around the "Hum" character - Hundred-character Ming curse.

After visualizing the mantra wheel, visualize a lot of white nectar coming out of the mantra wheel. The nectar fills the whole body of Vajrasattva and flows out from the pores of Vajrasattva's body.

These nectars flow in from your top door. It is best to visualize how big your body is, and how big a round moon-like nectar will flow in from the top of your head, flow into your body, and put your body The existing karma and afflictions are all pressed down, and then all these karma are squeezed out from the pores below the navel, sickness turns into pus and blood, karma turns into black ink like black ink, demons turn into snakes, Frogs, spiders, cockroaches and other small animals, and other things such as evil, turn evil into gray things.

The nectar water presses down the karma, just like water squirts out through squeezing. Your karma, illness, demons, and evil energy are all squirted out of the pores after being squeezed by the nectar water.

Then visualize the demon of death that is less than 100,000 miles away.

The appearance of the death devil is the appearance of a human, the head is the head of a bull, and the color of the body is red.

Around the death demon, visualize the grievances and creditors. The sentient beings who have been killed in the past and present life, if they become demons, ghosts or non-humans, they will become your grievances and creditors.

They were all around the Death Demon, all of them were human images, and they all said: "Give me something...Give me something..." At this time, the earth split open, and all the things that were drained by the nectar water entered the Death Demon and the creditors. In their mouths, they are very happy to eat, they are like eating nectar, because it is the nectar that is expelled.

When the grievances and creditors are full, the grudges they have with you will be eliminated, the death demon will not harm you, and you will live a long and healthy life.

You have to visualize it this way.

There are various types of sentient beings, such as grass-eating, meat-eating, and feces-eating. Death demons and grievances and creditors only eat black water from karma that has been excreted from the body, pus and blood from sickness, and so on.

(2) Eliminate karma from the top

The visualization method of the second one-hundred-syllable mantra is the upper row visualization, in which obstacles are expelled from the practitioner's body.

When reciting the hundred-syllable mantra of Vajrasattva, the nectar water flowing from Vajrasattva's body flows from the top of your head to the soles of your feet, and then slowly rises from the soles of your feet, rushing towards the top of your head to press the karmic obstacles outward. All flowed out from the eyes, ears, hair, etc., and then flowed into the mouths of death demons and creditors who were less than 100,000 miles away.

It's like the tea leaves in our cups. When water is poured into the cups, they also float up. That's the truth.

Think like this.

(3) Eliminate karmic obstacles in the middle

The third method of visualization of the hundred-syllable mantra is the visualization in the middle row, in which obstacles are removed from the navel of the practitioner.

Visualize that all the karmic obstacles and demonic obstacles are concentrated at the navel, and then turn the nectar into a vajra. Once the vajra is punched, all the karmic obstacles and demonic obstacles will splash out from the pores of the abdomen and flow into the mouth of the death demon.

After contemplating in this way, the earth is closed, and there is a little nectar on the ground. All the nectar that is left has turned into a vajra, and the earth has also become a vajra land. Death demons and grievances and creditors will never be able to come up.

Just visualize this way, then the first one will have a long life, and the second one will not come to you.

The debts of the acquaintances and creditors have been paid, so they will not come to you.

(4) Five-color mantra to eliminate karma

The visualization of the fourth hundred-syllable mantra is the five-color mantra to eliminate karma.

Visualize the white hundred-syllable mantra coming out of Vajrasattva's forehead, and the white nectar and white light melt into your forehead, eliminating the karma created by your body, and receiving the body blessing of the Guru Three Jewels.

Then, a red one-hundred-character mantra emerges from Vajrasattva's throat, and red nectar and red light melt into your throat, eliminating the karma created by your mouth, and receiving the blessings of Vajrasattva and other Buddhas and Tathagatas.

Then a blue hundred-syllable mantra came out of Vajrasattva's heart, and blue nectar and blue light melted into your heart, eliminating the karma created by the mind, the karma created by greed, hatred, and delusion. Willing to support it.

Then the yellow one-hundred-syllable mantra emerges from the navel of Vajrasattva, and the yellow nectar and yellow light melt into your navel. All the karma created by your body, speech, and mind will be eliminated, and the blessings of the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas will be obtained. .

Then, the green hundred-syllable mantra, green nectar, and green rays of light come out of the secret place of Vajrasattva, and enter your secret place, and all your afflictions such as greed, hatred, delusion, arrogance, doubt, and jealousy will be eliminated. Then you will be blessed with the achievements of the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas.

You have to visualize it this way.

(5) Wisdom and Brightness Eliminate Karmic Obstacles

The fifth 100-syllable mantra visualization is that the 100-syllable mantra of wisdom and light eliminates the karma of darkness.

Visualize that all the karma of your body, speech, and thoughts are all in your heart, visualize the inside of your stomach as darkness, and then Vajrasattva's blessing becomes white light. If it disappears, the karma will be eliminated in an instant, just visualize it like this.

Master Wensaba was a master who became a Buddha.

Master Wen Saba said that the most excellent way to eliminate karmic obstacles is: karmic obstacles are like darkness, blessings are like rays of light, the light of blessings completely eliminates the darkness of karmic obstacles in an instant, and the karmic obstacles disappear in an instant. This blessing is very powerful.

(6) Cultivating wisdom

The sixth type of 100-syllable mantra visualization is the visualization of cultivating wisdom.

All the pores of the practitioner visualize the word "Hu", and the word "Hu" emits immeasurable rays of light, and invites the Buddhas and Tathagatas to speak, argue, write, and broad, deep, quick, and bright wisdom, and then the Buddhas and Tathagatas His wisdom has become the Sword of Wisdom, Prajna Sutra, Manjushri Mantra, and Seed Mantra, which are integrated into the word "Hu", and the word "Hu" becomes a million times as bright as the sun's rays, eliminating all ignorance and darkness.

(7) Infinite Vajrasattva

The seventh visualization is to visualize a Vajrasattva in each of your pores, and then these Vajrasattvas will recite the one hundred-syllable mantra together, as many times as there are Vajrasattva.

Our physical body is also composed of earth, water, fire and wind. Each component can be visualized as Vajrasattva. Those with strong visualization ability can visualize each component as Vajrasattva, and then recite the Hundred-syllable Mantra together. .

This is the method of reciting once to achieve innumerable recitations.

There are many ways to visualize Vajrasattva, and we will introduce the above-mentioned ways of visualization.

The more you recite the Hundred-Character Mantra, the better.

Cultivating together is different from cultivating alone. Now twenty or thirty people are cultivating together, and reciting it once is twenty or thirty times.

Therefore, the blessing of common practice is great.

During the joint practice, Master or Dharma friends recite the scriptures together, and the master can also bless the disciples. Dharma friends recite the scriptures with strong visual power and can support each other and eliminate karmic obstacles to each other.

In addition, practicing together can also increase the merit, and reciting it once has many merits.

Usually in the monastery, it takes seven days to cultivate the Great Sun Tathagata, which is to recite 400,000 times in one retreat.

After that, he cultivated the dense vajra for seven days, which is also 400,000 times. If you really do it, you will have this merit.

The blessings of cultivating together are very great, and cultivating alone is not so great.

5. Confession

Let me be ignorant and ignorant, breaking oaths and breaking precepts,

The Guru, the Three Jewels, saves, and the deity, Satan, Vajradhara,

(Male reading) (Female reading)

Possessing a vast body of compassion, I take refuge in the Lord of all living beings,

Vajradhara said good men/good women, breaking vows and sins,

Everything is purified and eliminated, and the deity enters into my body, speech, and mind.

After the visualization, I have to repent: Because I don't know the precepts, I don't know what evil karma is, I have done many wrong things, broken my vows, and broke the precepts.

When the three precepts are broken, the precepts of not liberation, the precepts of bodhisattvas, and the precepts of tantra are all broken.

Please Guru Three Treasures save me! I want to take refuge in the deity Satan Vajrasattva (that is, Vajrasattva), and I want to take refuge in the guru, the Three Jewels! I have done a lot of wrong things in the past and I have to repent.

Repent like that.

Then Vajrasattva said: A good man (if it is a woman, it can be said to be a good woman or a good woman), violates the vows and sins, and everything is eliminated.

All guilt is removed.

The deity is integrated into the body, speech, and mind, that is, Vajrasattva is integrated into his own body, speech, and mind, and his body, speech, and mind are indistinguishable from Vajrasattva. This can also be integrated without receiving empowerment.

6. Backward

May this merit

pervasive in everything

I wait with all beings

All become Buddhas

Finally, it is devotion. You have accumulated such a great blessing, you must dedicate it.

If you don't dedicate yourself, this blessing will be easily eliminated.

No matter how big the good news is, it will be eliminated as soon as it gets angry. When angry and jealous, it is eliminated.

When dedicating, the bigger the vow, the better. We should vow that all beings in the six realms will be free from suffering and be happy, and all beings in the ten dharma realms will be free from suffering and be happy.

Blessings cannot be just dedicated to our own families being safe, otherwise the Blessings will be smaller.

You can't go back to someone for what you are, and this will reduce the blessings.

The good fortune is to return to the Dharma to live forever in the world and to bring peace to the world.

World peace is relatively small, but we human beings need peace, and Dharma needs peace to live forever. This is very important, so we give it a special devotion.

It's okay to go back to everything, don't make it smaller.

People's ego is very strong, so many people forcibly reduce it after accumulating good fortune.

Originally this good news was very big, he must make it smaller.

Dedicated to my children being at peace and my family being at peace, it has become like this.

You can recite sutras for one person, but the main goal is to be for the sentient beings in the six realms, and you must remember the six realms of sentient beings.

The later devotion is very important. After devotion, this blessing will not disappear.

Good fortune is like a glass of water. If you don't dedicate it, someone will pour it out. When you get angry, it will disappear, and the sun will dry it.

Even if you don't get angry, its fruit grows little by little, it's just so small, and as much as the fruit, the good fortune disappears.

If the water in the cup (blessing) is poured into the stream, then the size of the stream will be as big as the blessing.

If the water in the cup is poured into the lake, then the size of the lake will be as big as the blessing.

If the water in the cup is poured into the sea, then the greatness of the sea will bring great blessings.

The water of the sea cannot be dried or scooped.

In the same way, if you dedicate your devotion to the big aspects, anger and jealousy will not take away your blessings, no matter what you do, you will not take away your blessings, because it is like the ocean, so your blessings will also be grew.

Just like the above devotion, other devotions are also acceptable, as long as the bigger the devotion, the better.

Vajrasattva's practice teaching is complete.

Tashi Delek!

prostration
Please arouse Bodhicitta and listen carefully!

Today is a big prayer.

Prostration can accumulate great blessings, and the blessings can be as great as the blessings accumulated by a thousand golden wheel-turning kings.

The prostration can eliminate karma, and all the karma of body, speech and mind can be eliminated.

The merits of prostration are also great, all the meridians of the whole body can be opened up, and the blessings of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas can be obtained.

The prostration is also a kind of practice in the tantric method to exercise the body.

Therefore, the blessings and merits of the prostration are very great.

Visualize the Lord.

Visualize that there is a lotus throne in the void in front of you, and on the throne sits the Lord Buddha Shakyamuni Buddha.

Shakyamuni Buddha's mind visualizes the vajra total holding Buddha, and the vajra total holding Buddha's mind visualizes the blue hum () character of "Samadhi".

Buddha Shakyamuni has a yellow body with two arms, his left hand holds a seal, a bowl is held in his hand, and his right hand presses the ground.

From the center of the main Buddha Sakyamuni Buddha's heart to the right, the light changes from small to large, and Maitreya Bodhisattva and other "Guangxing School" lineage ancestors appear on the light end; from the main honor's heart to the left, Manjushri Bodhisattva appears on the light end Waiting for the lineage patriarchs of the "Deep View School"; in front are the masters who have formed a dharma relationship with themselves; behind are the lineage patriarchs of the "Blessing School of Practice", such as Vajradhara, Tilopa, Naropa, and Atisha.

If you are unfamiliar with these patriarchs, you can visualize them all in the image of Master Tsongkhapa.

Around Shakyamuni Buddha, there are four deities, Buddhas, Bodhisattvas, Arhats, Shravakas, Warriors, Dakinis, Dharma protectors and other deities.

On the thrones in front of all the Buddhas are placed the teachings and sutras of the luminous body that they have spoken.

Visualize the blue hum character in the hearts of the deities in the field of resources, the hum character emits light, and the light shines on the pure land of each Buddhist country, bringing the real Shakyamuni Buddha and the lineage patriarchs, masters, deities, Buddhas, and bodhisattvas. , Fate Jue Arhats, Shravaka Arhats, Warriors, Dakinis, Dharma Protectors and other wise deities are invited to join the deity deities who have been visualized in front of them, and can also be visualized as having three types of wisdom, compassion and ability. The Buddhas of merit, all of them showed their supernatural powers, and merged with the deities of the grain field.

We should believe in our hearts that the real field of merit is right in front of us.

The Buddhist scriptures say that the wisdom of the Buddha is everywhere, because the Buddha is the one who has achieved dual status, and the body and mind have become one. Therefore, wherever the wisdom of the Buddha pervades, the body of the Buddha can also permeate, but we are blocked by karma. Covered and invisible.

The other deities in the grain field are actually manifested by the Buddha, so they also exist in front of us.

Therefore, the greater our confidence, the greater the blessings and the accumulated merits.

During prostration:

1. Bow down.

Visualize yourself transforming into countless avatars, each standing respectfully in front of the grain field below.

First, lift up your hands and put your palms together on top of your head, put your thumbs in your palms, visualize holding a wish-fulfilling jewel in your palms when you put your palms together, bow to your guru, and put your palms together on top of your head.

By bowing to the guru, one can be reborn in the Pure Land and be blessed by the guru.

Then bow to the Buddha, put your palms together on your forehead, you can get the blessings of all Buddhas and Tathagatas, you can eliminate the karma created by the body, and the karma of killing, stealing, sexual misconduct, etc. can be eliminated.

Next, bowing down to the Dharma, putting your palms together on your throat, you can get the blessings of 84,000 Dharma doors, and you can eliminate the karma of speaking, lying, and provocative words.

Finally, one bows to the Sangha, puts the palms together on the heart, and can receive the blessings of Bodhisattvas, Arahants, and transcendent Dharma protectors.

Because bodhisattvas, arahants, and transcendent Dharma protectors are sangha treasures, they can eliminate karmic obstacles created by the mind, and karmic obstacles such as greed, hatred, wrong views, etc., can be eliminated.

Then, the palms are opened, the palms of the palms are raised upwards, and the palms of the palms are raised, and the countless wish-fulfilling treasures are offered to the guru's Three Jewels in the refuge state.

Then, with the palms down, press the ground from the elbow joint to the palm, kneel on the ground with both knees, and prostrate with the forehead on the ground. This is a small prayer.

Such as prostration, then press the ground with both hands and then slide forward and straighten, the whole body is prostrate on the ground (board) surface, the hands are folded and the palms are raised to the top of the head, and then put down and straightened, so that the five bodies are thrown to the ground.

Get up and do it straight down. When you do it for the last time, the palm of your bow will end from the top of your head down to your heart.

This kind of big prayer is the combination of the small prayer and the big prayer.

If you just do prostration alone, you don't need to do it together.

For prostration alone, the upright body quickly crawls down, the forehead touches the ground, and the hands are folded and raised to the top of the head.

The blessings of prostration are very large. There is so much dust and sand in the 80,000 miles of the ground that the entire body touches during the prostration. There are so many blessings.

The merit of prostration is also very great, that is, a thousand times the amount of dust and sand pressed down by the body when prostrating is the number of times you will be reborn as a wheel-turning holy king in the future. That is a very, very, very big blessing.

Now you can choose, you can combine the small prayer and the big prayer, you can just do the big prayer, and either one is a very, very big blessing.

You can also exercise and open up the meridians throughout the body.

The myriad ways to visualize yourself incarnate are crucial in your practice.

If you visualize yourself alone, you will have only one merit; if you visualize countless incarnations, you will have countless merits.

Just thinking about it like this will magnify your merit countless times, so why not do it! In the past, there was a lama in Ta'er Monastery, who completed 30 million big heads in three years.

Once, he reported his achievements to the native official living Buddha, a great achiever, and the native official living Buddha said to him: "You have cultivated well, but I only need three minutes to complete your three-year cultivation.

"The native official living Buddha said to use this method of visualization.

In Tibetan areas, whether the elderly or children, they usually do prostrations, exercise in prostrations, and use prostrations to accumulate blessings and eliminate karmic obstacles.

In the past, people from Qinghai went to the Potala Palace and the Jokhang Temple in Lhasa, Tibet for prostrations almost every day, and some people even carried their old mothers to the Potala Palace.

Some old mothers wished to go to the Potala Palace and the Jokhang Temple to worship Shakyamuni Buddha. They were very pious when they could not go alone and asked their sons to help carry them on their backs.

Some people walk 100 meters behind their mothers, put their mothers down, and then come back to do prostrations by themselves. This phenomenon not only happened before, but also happens now.

To do this as a child is to honor your parents. To honor your parents to this extent, you walk 100 meters or 200 meters behind your back, put your parents down, and then come back to do prostrations and worship your parents.

In this way, back 100 meters and come back to do the big prayer, that is to say, only one trip to Lhasa is equivalent to three trips to Lhasa.

Really very special! Now Qinghai can often be seen, and many people go to Lhasa for prostration. This is a great blessing! I hope you all have more prostrations, good health and good luck!

2. Spoken salute.

Visualize that each of your avatars has an infinite number of heads, each head has an infinite number of mouths, and each mouth is chanting the Buddha's praise.

The words of praise can be chosen by yourself, or you can recite: "The body is full of auspiciousness and perfection, satisfying all sentient beings' prayers; seeing all the knowledge and meaning, respectfully praise the Lord Shakyamuni."

prostration

3. To pay tribute.

Generate a sincere heart of faith in the Three Jewels of the Guru.

Always think about the merits of the Three Jewels, read the biographies of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas or read the biographies of the lineage guru, so that a respectful and pure heart towards the guru and the Three Jewels can arise.

This is a courtesy.
