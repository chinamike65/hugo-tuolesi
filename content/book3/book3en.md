#### Introduction to Ngawang Gyatso Vajra Guru

Master Ngawang Gyatso was born on March 3, 1969 (the fifteenth day of the first lunar month) in Hainan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Qinghai Province.

The master began to practice Buddhism as a novice monk at the age of six, and became an ordained monk at the age of eighteen. He studied with Dharma Master Lama Yong Zeng, Geshe Rinpoche, Lobsang Dorje Vajra Guru, Gejia Rinpoche, Dharma Master Yeshe Gyatso, and Gazang Qusong Vajra Guru and the 10th Panchen Lama.

Master Ah Wang, having followed the precepts of his teachers, received complete transmission of the teachings from his seven masters, the forty-sixth generational heirs of the "Prajna Paramita Sutra", the most important classic of Buddhism. From them he obtained more than 200 kinds of empowerments, more than 300 advanced special empowerments, more than 280 guiding precepts, with more than 500 scriptural sutras and more than 80 oral transmissions of intangible secrets. Therefore, the lineage of the master's doctrinal transmission is extremely complete and especially rare.

His Holiness Dharma Master Yongzeng, who was once the sutra teacher of the living Buddha, Sechi, in Lamodeqin Monastery was a person of superior virtue and the complete holder of the transmissions of the Gelugpa tantric teachings. Master Ah Wang followed Master Yongzeng for more than 20 years and absorbed all of the experience of the Venerable Dharma Master. The other six masters are also highly proficient in the esoteric secrets and have sufficient evidence of exceptional scholarly achievements. 

In addition, Master Ah Wang studied at Qinghai Buddhist College and the Ta'er (Kumbum) Monastery  Debating College of Dialectics (Debating College).
With a single-minded commitment to study and wide erudition, he completed the study of sutra and tantra, the five major theories of the five great Dharma masters, well ahead of schedule.

Since graduating from Qinghai Buddhist Academy and Ta'er Monastery Debating Academy with excellent grades, the master has been living at Qinghai Tuole Monastery, serving as the Vajra Guru and the abbot of the monastery. He teaches the monks of Tuole Monastery every day in groups: lectures on the five great treatises, San Shi Dao, and the four tantras, and has set up a new sutra debating school in the monastery.

Master Ah Wang has now produced several batches of lamas with a Geshe degree (equivalent to a Ph.D. in Buddhism).

The master also insists on going into retreat for two months every year.

Lama Yongzeng once told Master Ah Wang: **"Your whole career in this life is to turn the wheel of Dharma widely and spread the Dharma for the benefit of all living beings."**

Master Ah Wang often gives sermons, teachings, lectures, and empowerment ceremonies in both Tibetan and Chinese areas, and often holds patriotic teachings, and patriotic activities in monasteries, making due contributions to the promotion of social harmony and stable development.

At the invitation of believers from other places, the master has travelled all over the world to teach the sutras and the Dharma to those who are destined to hear them.

In 2009 and 2014, invited by the Buddhist community in Macau, the master, as representative of Tibetan Buddhist monks, presided over the Puja for the 10th and 15th anniversary of Macau's return to the motherland.

In October 2015, the master was also invited to participate in the 2015 Chongsheng International Forum co-organized by the Yunnan Buddhist Association and the Dali Chongsheng Temple.

Master Ngawang is not only perfect in his practice and perfect in his eloquence, but he is also the author of a rich collection of writings.

The Master's writings include Commentary on Philosophy, Commentary on the Prajna Paramita Diamond Sutra, Dictation from the Three Masters of the Three Paths and Three Schools, Vajrasattva Ritual and Practice, and Dakini Buddha's Mother Ritual. Tracks and Practical Practices, Practice of Retreat, Simmering Sang Ritual, Biography of Vajra Guru Gazang Qusong, History of Tibetan Buddhism, Dabao Motto, Nectar Dharma Rain, Tantric Buddhism Feng Shui and the "Dharma Ocean Treasures" series, etc.

The master's writings are concise and comprehensive, and the analysis is profound and thorough, and has been praised and acclaimed by many great scholars in Buddhist circles at home and abroad.

Master Ngawang once studied under the 10th Panchen Lama, who is deeply loved by the people. The Panchen Lama was called "a great patriot and an outstanding leader of Tibetan Buddhism" by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and made many important contributions to Buddhism in China.

Master Ngawang was deeply influenced by the Panchen Lama. In his religious thought, he advocated that Buddhist disciples should be concerned with the common people, cherish the "three great loves" and practice the "four practices" in order to achieve the harmony and perfection of the "five vows".

"Three Loves": patriotism, love for the people, and love for education.

"Four Practices": take self-purification as the foundation, take altruism as the principle, take harmony as the spirit, and take enlightenment as the goal.

"Five Wishes": Great social harmony, great national unity, great national prosperity, great world peace, great perfection in practice.

Under the leadership of Master Ngawang, the Sangha of Tuola Monastery adheres to the rule of the Gelug School. The results are among the best. Master Ngawang said that no matter if we are talking about Southern Buddhism, Chinese Buddhism or Tibetan Buddhism, they are all Buddha's Dharma, and they are all very special.

Buddhists should go deeper into the scriptures, diligently study and think, and establish a right view. At the same time, it is necessary to develop Bodhicitta widely and truly think for the sake of all sentient beings, in order to achieve a perfect life for oneself and others.

San Shi Dao

The third of the series "Treasures of the Dharma Ocean" in Tuole Monastery

Sanshidao (Part 1 - Lower Scope)

Ngawang Gyatso Vajra Guru explained:

I pay homage to the Great Master and the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas!

Thank you Master! He worked hard to explain the "San Shi Dao", and personally guided the proof-reading of the book, benefiting all sentient beings. Thanks to the teacher's instructions, I wrote this preface with sincerity and admiration.

I would like to share with fellow practitioners the experience of proof-reading and studying "San Shi Dao" over the past year. Please forgive me for any parts which may seem incomprehensible or difficult to understand.

In order to save all sentient beings, the Buddha preached 84,000 Dharma Doors, the core of which is the sequence of the Bodhi path. The order of the path is either manifest or hidden, and has always been hidden in the scriptures.

The sequence of Stages of the Way preached by Buddha Shakyamuni is "The Great Prajna Sutra", and the sequence of Stages preached by Maitreya Bodhisattva is "The View on the Majesty of the Present". 

Great Bodhisattvas such as Nagarjuna and Asanga, as the lineage masters of the sequence of Stages, have all been followers of the sequence of Stages. 

The successive biography of books and essays.

It was not until Venerable Atisha's "The Lamp for the Path to Enlightenment" that the order of the path of to enlightenment was clearly stated, and it was not until Master Tsongkhapa's "The Graded Stages of the Path to Enlightenment" that the steps of the path were explained clearly.

Countless practitioners have achieved success according to the stages of the path to enlightenment, and they have also become a part of learning according to the stages of the path. However, the Great Exposition of the Stages of the Path is very terse and difficult to understand, especially for beginners.

The study characteristics of Gelugpa.

The compassionate master, taking into account the difficulties of all living beings in their studies, explained to us the essence of the path to enlightenment - "The Three Paths".

The "San Shi Dao" explained by the master focuses on the basics. In terms of content, it is mainly based on the teachings of the predecessors of the Gelug School and the sages of the Kadam School. The front and back sections of the whole book  explain and supplement each other.

In teaching the Dharma, the master cultivated profound and extensive knowledge, and adopted a comprehensive teaching method, including Yin and Ming, which was used when explaining the five traditional monastic subjects. The logic is rigorous and clear.

On the whole "San Shi Dao", the master uses vivid and concise language and interesting allusions to describe how an ordinary person must take a bright road from attaining perfection in the world to liberation and becoming a Buddha.

The lower Path mainly talks about the impermanence of life, the suffering of the three evil paths, taking refuge, and knowing cause and effect. Liberation from the cycle of samsara; the middle Path talks about bodhicitta, the ten paramitas, and the four captures, with the goal of attaining Buddhahood.

The cultivation of the three ways of lower, middle, and upper are the stages that every practitioner must go through. Buddhas and Bodhisattvas have come this way, and so have patriarchs and great virtuous masters.

The master also said that the lower path is the foundation and the most difficult part to cultivate. After crossing the lower path and understanding the stages of the path to enlightenment, you will clearly know which stage you are at.

The direction will become clearer.

Right now, we need to know what to cultivate, how to cultivate, to what extent, and how long it will take; what to cultivate in the next stage,

What materials need to be prepared, etc., are all clearly explained.

When reading other classics, it also has a strong guiding significance. It enables practitioners to determine which part of the Dharma a sutra belongs to, whether it is suitable for practice at the current stage, and so on. It is of great help to the study, and it has swept away the confusion in the mind of the student, and made his confidence in the Guru and the Three Jewels more firm.

"San Shi Dao" is not only a teaching of Buddhism, but also has a strong guiding significance for life in this world. The book tells us: To truly cherish oneself and life, is to cherish the human body and cultivate earnestly; if you want to be prosperous and healthy, you must not steal or kill, you must give more, release more living animals, and repent of karma; If you have prestige and good karma, you must not create bad karma and make all living beings happy.

In every respect, it varies.

It can be said to be the best guide book on life in this world.

The master understands the suffering of sentient beings too well, and his words directly point to the hearts of the people.

During the proof-reading period, I often remembered the master's explanation in the middle of the night, even in my dreams, and I couldn't calm down for a long time.

The teacher's words are like a simple and powerful old hoe, and every sentence is hoeed on his heart that has been blinded by ignorance for a long time.

Thinking about the first half of my life, I didn’t know how to choose between good and bad karma, I was dazed and didn’t know the direction, and I lived a life of confusion of right and wrong.

Fortunately, it is worth meeting the teacher, and then you have to wake up.

From now on, just by listening to the teacher's words, being an honest person, steadfastly studying, and benefiting sentient beings, can the meaning of life continue to increase, and only then can one be worthy of the three jewels, of the teacher and one's own life.

The "San Shi Dao" published this time was compiled by many disciples of Tuo Le Shenzhen Center, based on video materials taught by the master in Hong Kong and Lishui in recent years, over two years.

In the process of sorting out the materials, the master also expanded a lot of content according to the actual situation of modern people's practice of Buddhism.

In particular, more detailed explanations and supplements have been made for the relatively brief parts in the "Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path of Enlightenment ".

For example, the section on "Approaching the Good Men" in the "Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path of Enlightenment " has only 15 pages (Guanghua Temple edition of "The Path of Enlightenment"), and the text is difficult to understand. A Detailed explanation is given.

It can be said that this edition of "San Shi Dao" is the most comprehensive, thorough and easy-to-understand book among the books that explain the correct sequence for teaching and learning the Dharma.

The master has repeatedly emphasized that the sooner the "San Shi Dao" is published, the sooner it will benefit all sentient beings!

Therefore, I often proof-read with my disciples until very late at night, and started proof-reading early the next day.

In June 2014, due to overwork, the master felt unwell. Afterwards, at the strong request of the Hong Kong disciples, he went to Hong Kong for a physical examination and adjusted his medication for half a year.

The master hopes that the vast number of Buddhist students can correctly understand the essence of the Buddha's Dharma while they have a strong desire for the Buddha's holy teaching tools, get out of the misunderstanding of non-sequential and blind practice, and diligently study and reflect on the path to enlightenment, and practice diligently according to the three paths, in order to realize enlightenment as soon as possible!

Bow down, thank you, Master!

Thanks to Nie Dolma and all the brothers who participated in the proof-reading!

Inferior disciple Sanjay was established

#### PART I

----

Such as the teaching of the extremely difficult victors, the strictness of the ministry of esoteric interpretation,

The name is spread all over the three places, and I salute the dragon fiercely without any footing.

Photographing the two great cars is good at spreading the flow, seeing deeply that there is no error in wide practice,

Perfect Dharma, teaching Tibetan, salute and hold him the wisdom of burning lamps.

Seeing all the Buddha's words and eyes everywhere, the virtuous species escape from the highest order,

Compassionate, convenient, and good openness, and pay homage to these good teachers.

Zhanbu is skillful to make the top rock, and everyone is called the beautiful and wonderful flag,

Longmeng has no two Dharma streams, and the second best lineage of Enlightenment.

Fulfilling the wishes of many people, teaching the terma such as King Quan,

Countless sutras and tantras come together, and auspicious teachings gather in the ocean.

Witnessing that the teachings of the saints are not violated, and that there is no surplus of scriptures to teach,

It is easy to obtain the deep meaning of the saints, and the foolish and evil cliffs are rescued.

Therefore, the skillful person from India and Tibet, who always believes in Professor Yisheng,

Jue only the order of the three priests, who is not enthusiastic and happy.

.......... Poetry of the Path of Enlightenment

Chapter 1 - lineage of the Paths

 This time I will tell you about the Three Paths and the stages of the Path to Enlightenment.

First of all, we must understand the meaning of "Stages of the Path to Enlightenment".

Bodhi means enlightenment, cut off refers to the removal of afflictions and obstacles to knowledge; Enlightenment means the realization of emptiness, and also has the meaning of awareness; The Way refers to the Three Paths, which are the Lower, Middle, and Upper Paths; the order is the sequence, the procedure.

The Buddha Dharma sequence contains 84,000 Dharma gates, and what the Three Paths teach is the correct sequence of the "Stages of the Path of Enlightenment".

To talk about the "Stages of the Path of Enlightenment", we must talk about the "Extensive Treatise on the Stages of the Path of Enlightenment".

The Dharma of Buddhism is inherited from the pure and perfect Buddha, and the sequence of the paths is also passed down by Shakyamuni Buddha himself.

Once you understand the teaching of the order of the Path, when you study the sutras in the future, you will realize that: all Buddhist scriptures teach the order of the Path.

Buddha Shakyamuni preached the "Prajna Paramita Sutra" at Vulture Peak. After the Chinese translation of the "Prajna Paramita Sutra", there are 600 volumes, including the entire content of 84,000 dharmas, and it is the most important Buddhist scripture.

The "Prajna Paramita Sutra" explicitly preaches the profound order of the Path, while the hidden meaning preaches the vast order of the Path.

The very deep Path sequence was passed on to Manjushri by the Buddha, and Manjushri passed it on to Nagarjuna, and later formed the deep insight sect Dao sequence; the vast Dao sequence was passed on by the Buddha to Maitreya Bodhisattva. He created Maitreya's Five Sutras, such as the "Abhisamaya-alaṅkāra sutra", also known as the Five Treatises of Maitreya, as a teaching of the path to enlightenment, and passed it on to Asanga Bodhisattva. Later, the Guangxing School path was formed.

In this way, in ancient India, two different lineages, deep insight and broad practice, were formed.

The Deep Insight School teaches the right view of emptiness, and the Guangxing School talks about the convenient method.

Only by learning and cultivating the two methods of wisdom, right view and skilfull means, can one be liberated and become a Buddha. Just like the two wings of a bird, both are required.

Before Venerable Atisha, the deep and broad paths were inherited separately.

The lineage of the Profound View School passes from Manjushri to Nagarjuna, Nagarjuna to Candrakirti, Candrakirti Bodhisattva to Dazhengli Rhododendron, and Dazhengli Rhododendron to Xiaozhengli Rhododendron.

The Guangxing School was passed on from Maitreya Bodhisattva to Asanga Bodhisattva. At first, Asanga Bodhisattva retreated for 12 years. After 12 years, he met Maitreya Bodhisattva. Maitreya Bodhisattva brought Asanga Bodhisattva to Tusita Heaven and passed on the Five Sutras of Maitreya.

6

Asanga Bodhisattva passed on the lineage of the Guangxing School to Vasubandhu Bodhisattva, who was Asanga Bodhisattva's half-brother.

Vasubandhu Bodhisattva passed it on to the Vimuktisena, and gradually spread to the great and small Gusa Li and Master Dharmakirti.

Venerable Atisha got the lineage of Profound View from Xiaozhengli Dujuan and the lineage of Guangxing School from Master Dharmakirti.

Venerable Atisha also received the lineage of the Dorje Chang / Vajradhara of the Practice Blessing School. Shakyamuni Buddha incarnated as Vajradhara and passed it on to Tilopa, Tilopa passed it on to Naropa, Naropa passed it on to Zhububa, Jububa then passed it on to Venerable Atisha.

At the same time, Venerable Atisha also received the lineage of Shantideva Bodhisattva's "Entering Bodhisattva Actions" by Manjushri.

In this way, the Venerable received the complete transmission and teaching of the sutra and tantra, and gained access to all the Dharma.

On this basis, Venerable Atisha wrote the famous "Lamp for the Path to Enlightenment", which captures all the essentials of the Dharma, and the phrase "Stages of the Path" has been around since then.

The "Lamp for the Path to Enlightenment" has really opened up a path, a path that an ordinary person can follow and become a Buddha in his present life in a turbid world. It is very, very special!

Later, other sects in the Tibetan area also formed their own sects based on the "Lamp for the Path to Enlightenment", benefiting countless people and laying the foundation for the establishment of the Kadam School.

7

Venerable Atisha passed the "Lamp for the Path to Enlightenment" to Master Dromtönpa. At that time, the venerable passed it to him in secret, and Dromtönpa asked inexplicably, "Why did the venerable teach the secrets to others? The mantra, and teach me the order of the path?" The Venerable replied, "Besides you, I have not found anyone to whom can entrust this Dharma!" This shows the importance and splendor of the "Lamp for the Path to Enlightenment", and it also indicates that it is the origin that Master Dromtönpa will spread the Dharma and benefit life in the future.

Later, Master Dromtönpa founded Radreng / Reting Monastery, established a Kadam School, spread the Dharma, and guided the practice according to the teachings of "Lamp for the Path to Enlightenment". Many people have achieved this.

After the establishment of the Kadam School, Master Dromtönpa passed the "Lamp for the Path to Enlightenment" to Gonpawa, and Gonpawa passed it on to Yeshiba, and Yeshiba passed on Tamaba and Jechenpo, forming the Kadam Road. Sequential faction.

Dromtönpa also passed on the order of the path to Shi Owa, who passed on to Chayuwa, and later formed the Taoist order of the Kadam Professor School.

Master Tsongkhapa received the lineages of these two schools from the great siddhi of Lodha, Namkha Gyaltsen. Master Namkha Gyaltsen was very accomplished and had received the deep teachings of Vajra Hand Bodhisattva himself.

In addition, Master Tsongkhapa also obtained the lineage of the Kadampa school from the Dharma Khenpo Dharma Protector of Tsaku Monastery, which was passed on by Dromtönpa to Potoba, and from Potoba to Sharaba.

8

The three schools were gradually developed and formed according to the broad strategy of study and the ability of later disciples.

To put it simply, the Kadam scriptures are based on the practices of various great scriptures and explain the order of the path, similar to the combination of the five great treatises and the steps of the path now, and the highest requirements for the wisdom and diligence of the disciples; The sect is to explain the order of the path in accordance with the "Stages of the Holy Dharma" by Master Zhuolongpa, which is slightly simpler than the previous sect, similar to the current study in accordance with the broad and abbreviated theory of the path to enlightenment, and the requirements for the disciples are slightly lower; The master explained the order of the path, pointed out the main points, and at the same time cooperated with various brief guiding principles to guide the disciples to study and practice, and the requirements for the disciples were the lowest.

In this way, Master Tsongkhapa obtained all the lineage of the broad, medium and brief stages of the Bodhi path, and the master created the "The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path to Enlightenment" based on "Lamp for the Path to Enlightenment".

"Lamp for the Path to Enlightenment" provides a high-level summary of the teachings and demonstrations of Buddhism. It is very concise and only covers a few pages.

The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path of Enlightenment explains the Theory of the Lamp for the Path to Enlightenment in a deeper and broader way, which is broad, profound and easy to understand. For those who find the Lamp for the Path to Enlightenment difficult to understand, the Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path of Enlightenment explains it very clearly .

In Tibetan areas, the Tibetan version of "Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path of Enlightenment " can be understood a lot by an ordinary person, such as a sheep herder; an arhat with high wisdom will also find it profound, subtle and inconceivable when he sees it. Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path of Enlightenment  is very, very special.

10

Chapter 2 - the peculiarity of the order of the path, mentions the three ways, the order of the path of enlightenment, and the "Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path of Enlightenment", so it is inevitable to mention Master Tsongkhapa. So, what kind of person is Master Tsongkhapa?

Section 1 - Master Tsongkhapa was born on the twenty-fifth day of the tenth year of the Tibetan calendar in 1357 in Huangzhong County, Qinghai Province. Because the place of birth is called "Tsongkha" in Tibetan, he is honored as Tsongkhapa, which means born in Tsongkha.

Master Tsongkhapa is the founder of the Gelug School of Tibetan Buddhism and the wisdom reincarnation of Manjushri. Maitreya Bodhisattva once said: "The incarnation of Manjushri, like the eyes and heart of all Buddhas and Bodhisattvas, will appear in the world."

11

Master Tsongkhapa's father often recited "Manjushri's True Name Sutra". Before the birth of the master, he dreamed of a great virtue, saying that he came from Wutai Mountain in the Han Dynasty and stayed with him, and then various auspicious signs appeared one after another.

All this shows that Master Tsongkhapa is the true reincarnation of Manjushri.

The master was given the five precepts at the age of three. At the age of seven, he was sent to the Xia Qiong Monastery of the Kadam School by his family. He took the secret name of Lobsang Drakpa, and later received the novice precepts. In 1409, the master established Ganden Monastery, and on the foundation of the Kadam School, the Gelug School was established.

The master studied with many teachers in his life, and these masters belonged to different sects. The master gathered the heads of various schools, and after assiduous study, he gradually revealed many unparalleled talents.

In a dharma conference, Master Shuofuwuhan explained 15 treatises at the same time, for three consecutive months without interruption; two books were finished early, and the other two were added immediately. A total of 17 treatises were lectured before and after the dharma conference. . At another Dharma conference, he explained twenty-one great treatises on the same day.

There was even a marvelous event in which twenty-nine great treatises were simultaneously lectured at the Dharma conference, which was admirable. These wonderful lectures have never happened before in India or Tibet.

There are more than 600 volumes of the Prajna Paramita Sutra, which Buddha Shakyamuni could finish in one day, and many listeners could fully understand its profound meaning. It is only by virtue of language that such a wonderful speech can be performed.

12

In the period after the completion of his studies, the master of eloquence without hindrance, according to the scriptures and sects, no one can match;

The master of learning without hindrance is able to understand all the Buddhadharma, and can realize all the holy words of the Buddha as practical teachings.

Master Khedrubje Gelek Pelzang praised: 

The Bodhisattvas in India and the Master Buston in Tibet, although they have learned widely, are not as well-versed as Master Tsongkhapa.

The Kagyu sect has a teaching of Mahamudra, the Nyingma sect has a teaching of Dzogchen, the Sakya sect has a teaching of Dao and Fruit, and the Kadam sect has a teaching of impermanence and bodhicitta.

However, the only one who can teach all the sutras spoken by the Buddha is the teaching of Tsongkhapa. For this reason, the scriptures created by the masters also have the following characteristics:

Able to declare the complete path sequence for the upper, middle and lower foundations.

They are all written by the masters themselves.

Perfect and flawless, no one can refute it.

It has characteristics not found in other scriptures.

All the wise men rejoice and believe.

In the early days of the precept-keeping master, the tenets of Tibetan Buddhism were relaxed, and Khedrubje Gelek Pelzang said in the biography of Master Tsongkhapa: 

"At the time when Buddhism in the snowy land was about to be destroyed and existed in name only, some monks even took the name of the mantle and bowl they used to become monks. Never heard of it."

This shows how desolate Tibetan Buddhism was at that time, and the master was very distressed about it, so he strongly advocated the rectification of the precepts.

The master's own body, speech, and mind rested in a pure and solemn state. Inspired by the master, monks in large and small monasteries in Tibetan areas gradually became pure and virtuous.

Even if I accidentally violated it occasionally, I would feel ashamed and immediately repent according to the ritual.

Many saints have been prophesied by the master Shakyamuni Buddha, Maitreya Bodhisattva, Manjushri Bodhisattva, Machig Labdrön, Yuecheng Bodhisattva, Guru Rinpoche, etc., all of whom have prophesied Master Tsongkhapa.

Padmasambhava's "Ce Li Pai Wen" says:

Padmasambhava foretold that a fully ordained Buddhist monk named Lobsang Drakpa would appear in the east, near the land of China who would be regarded as an emanation of a Bodhisattva of the greatest renown and would attain the Complete Enjoyment Body of Buddha – Enlightenment.

"Near the eastern part of the Han land, there is a Sakyamuni named Lobsang."

In addition, in many sutras and treatises of great siddhas, there are prophecies of Master Tsongkhapa, who call him the second Buddha.

For example, Buddha Shakyamuni once foretold:

"In the snowy regions of Tibet, there will be a person named Lobsang Drakpa who will solemnize my incarnation Buddha image as the image of Sambhogakaya."

Later, as predicted by the Buddha, on the first day of the first lunar month in 1409, Lama Tsongkhapa personally presented a five-buddha crown made of pure gold to the Sakyamuni Buddha statue in the Jokhang Temple in Lhasa at the prayer meeting. There are many precious pearl gemstones on it, and the craftsmanship is exquisite and very strict.

14

Master Wisdom Unhindered has been diligent in studying, thinking, cultivating, lecturing, and writing throughout his life, and has written nineteen books, each of which is the master's mastery.

It can be said that every word is as precious as gold.

In particular, The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path of Enlightenment and The  Great Exposition of Tantra pointed out many subtle mistakes in practice, which are even more precious to later generations of disciples. The master also cultivated many eminent monks and great virtues, saved countless sentient beings, and reinvigorated Tibetan Buddhism, just like the reappearance of the Buddha.

Master Tsongkhapa's special qualities and merits are innumerable and inconceivable. For example, the master foresaw that sentient beings in the turbid world would be troubled and have difficulty in practicing diligently.

For the sake of all beings in the last days to be able to study, and for the Gelugpa to live for a long time in the world, the master is merciful. During the retreat of Olka Cholung, he made thirty-seven point mandala offerings a million times, and his wrists were worn through and he could see the bones. He dedicated the merits of this offering to the practitioners of later generations.

Therefore, disciples of later generations who study the Gelug school are generally wealthier and live longer.

We are fortunate enough to meet the teachings of Master Tsongkhapa, we should cherish and be grateful. There are dozens of biographies of Master Tsongkhapa, many of which are written by later eminent monks, great virtues, and great achievers. We have time to read more, so that we can strengthen our confidence in the Dharma and in our study.

16

Section 2 - "The Graded Stages of the Path to Enlightenment" talks about the order of the Path, which is the content of the "The Graded Stages of the Path to Enlightenment". Therefore, the excellence of the "The Graded Stages of the Path to Enlightenment" is the speciality of the Three Paths. Victory is also the ultimate victory of the path.

"The Graded Stages of the Path to Enlightenment" has five qualities: the creator, the teaching, the location, the persuasion, and the family.

1. Venerable Atisha, the creator of the San Shi Dao, is the incarnation of Amitabha. There were countless disciples in India at that time, and many of them achieved high achievements.

When His Holiness Venerable Atisha went to Tibet to teach the Dharma, he mainly taught the Three Ways, which enabled countless practitioners in Tibet to be liberated by studying the Three Ways.

The teachings of His Holiness also influenced the major sects in Tibetan areas, especially the Gelug sect, which was formerly known as the New Kadampa.

Master Tsongkhapa, the creator of the broad and brief discussion of the Bodhi path, is the reincarnation of Manjushri. The master explained in detail the three ways of Venerable Atisha, and created a complete Buddhist practice in Tibetan areas. Never before.

17

Before Master Tsongkhapa, most monks in Tibetan areas had abolished the precepts; in practice, those who practice meditation cannot distinguish between gross and subtle drowsiness, those who practice emptiness do not understand the deep insight of the Middle Way, and those who practice tantric methods do not Understand phantom body and double body movement.

The emergence of the master has corrected these phenomena one by one. 

It can be said that Master Tsongkhapa saved Tibetan Buddhism.

2. The Exceptional Teachings:

 The special teachings include: the quality is correct; the quantity is perfect; the order is accurate.

(1) The nature is correct

The content of The Graded Stages of the Path to Enlightenment is completely correct in nature, without the slightest error.

In the past, the writings of many great siddhas in Tibet contained many errors in their insight.

Tsongkhapa's eldest disciple, Gyaltsab Je, said that before he met the master, his understanding of emptiness based on the writings of previous scholars was wrong.

Most of the previous commentators achieved success in the convenient method, such as renunciation and bodhicitta. Even if they achieved success, they did not necessarily realize emptiness.

18

Therefore, in terms of the nature of the Dharma taught by the previous generations, there was a little error.

What Tsongkhapa said is not at all wrong in nature, it is very accurate and complete.

(2) The quantity is complete

The entire contents of The Graded Stages of the Path to Enlightenment are extraordinary.

why? Because it is widely discussed that the lineage of Nagarjuna and Asanga is the two major vehicles.

Buddha Shakyamuni once predicted: 

"The practitioners of the later generations will follow Nagarjuna and Asanga Bodhisattva to practice, and to follow other great achievers, the foundation of some people is suitable, but in terms of the foundation of all people, not necessarily suitable.”

Therefore, Shakyamuni Buddha said: 

"In common practice, everyone must follow Nagarjuna and Asanga Bodhisattva."

The essentials of the Three Treasures taught by Buddha Shakyamuni are all condensed in the "The Graded Stages of the Path to Enlightenment", and the outline of the extensive treatise is the San Shi Dao.

Dharma should be learned through listening, thinking, and practicing.

But if there are too many dharma books to study, or if you don’t have the concept of order in your mind, you won’t be able to read it, because 84,000 dharmas can’t be read or learned completely.

Master Tsongkhapa condensed the essence of the 84,000 Dharma doors in a book "The Graded Stages of the Path to Enlightenment", and explained the stages of Buddhist practice completely and clearly, so it can be called a perfect number.

19

(3) The order is accurate

In The Graded Stages of the Path to Enlightenment, the stages of practice are explained very clearly.

It is very clear where to start training when you are just getting started, and how to practice after a while;

If the order is not clear, it will be confusing and lead to blind and disorderly learning.

Only the Bodhisattvas of the Eighth Stage can cultivate the Dharma door, and ordinary people will not be able to achieve it.

It is very, very important to study in order! Whether it is lecturing the scriptures or practicing, if the order is not correct, there will be no achievement.

This is different from reading a book. When reading a book, you need to read more about the news, and you can read any book.

When you really want to cultivate, you have to do it in sequence, so that you won't make mistakes and you will be successful.

If there is no order, there will be no achievement, just as wandering will not help you reach your destination.

3. The place where you live is the place where you live.

20

Master Tsongkhapa was in Radreng Monastery when he wrote "Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path of Enlightenment ".

Radreng Monastery was founded in 1057 by the founder of Kadampa, Dromtonpa, and has a history of more than 900 years. It is the first monastery of the Kadampa.

"Radreng" means "to eradicate all afflictions until it is free from the reincarnation of the three realms". Buddha Sakyamuni had a prophecy about the Radreng Monastery in the Buddhist scriptures.

Studying, cultivating or writing at the practice of the predecessors, the blessing is very powerful, and it is easy to achieve.

The location of Radreng Monastery used to be a bald mountain without a single tree. Later, Songtsan Gampo, the incarnation of Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva, visited here, sprinkled water for washing his hair on the hillside, and prayed for blessings, so two trees grew. There are 15,000 verdant Thuja trees, all of which are prophesied in Buddhist scriptures.

In Radreng Monastery, there are spiritual bone stupas of Master Jinzhou, Venerable Atisha, and Master Dromtonpa, as well as sacred objects such as the statue of Venerable Atisha.

4. After persuading Master Tsongkhapa to practice according to "A Lamp for the Path to Enlightenment" for a period of time, he attained the achievement of the Three Paths.

At this time, the master saw with his own eyes the lineage masters of the two major sects all appearing in front of him.

From Shakyamuni Buddha to the master's own master, including Manjushri, Nagarjuna, as well as all the great virtues of Kadampa, such as Master Dromtonpa  and Master Bodowa, I also saw Venerable Atisha with my own eyes. .


Then, all the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas and teachers merged into the body of Venerable Atisha, who put his hand on the head of Master Tsongkhapa and said, "You want to benefit all sentient beings, and write the "Guide to Bodhi", I'm here to help you and bless you."

After speaking, Venerable Atisha merged into Master Tsongkhapa's body.

At the same time, Guan Que Hua Sang, a great siddha in Tibet at that time, also encouraged Master Tsongkhapa.

In the end, Master Tsongkhapa wrote "The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path of Enlightenment."

During the time when the master was writing "The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path of Enlightenment", Manjushri came in person three times.

It was the first time I came to persuade Master Tsongkhapa to write "The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path of Enlightenment".

When he wrote about the meditation and wisdom method of the San Shi Dao, that is, the meditation paramita and the wisdom paramita, the master thought: Now there are too many people without great wisdom, and it is useless to write too much in this part.

At this time, Manjushri Bodhisattva appeared again and said to Master Tsongkhapa: "If you want to write more deep and broad meditation and wisdom Paramita, it will be of great benefit to all living beings in future generations."

There are human beings and non-human beings among the disciples who support Master Tsongkhapa's writing "The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path of Enlightenment".

For example, during the period when the master wrote the Great Treatise, the diet was mainly undertaken by the land gods of the three thousand great thousand worlds, especially the Animaqin, who was a mountain god of Ando Goluo and a Bodhisattva of the Ten Lands.



5. After Master Tsongkhapa, his family member, wrote the "The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path of Enlightenment", countless human beings and non-human beings have been liberated by studying the Great Theory.

Among them, it is even more difficult to count those who are able to practice both exoteric and esoteric practice and promote Mahayana Buddhism.

Among the disciples of the master, not to mention those who have attained ordinary achievements, are those who are proficient in the essentials of the Tripitaka, and those who have completed the three disciplines of precepts, concentration, and wisdom, and those who have practised intensively in the three ways of spirituality and the second stage of Tantric Buddhism, are like the stars in the night sky, innumerable.

Among them, Gyaltsab Je, Kedrub Je, Zhaba Jianshen, Jamyang Choje,  Jamchen Choje (Daci Dharma King), Gyu Sherab-sengge (Hui Shishi), Gyelwa Gendun-drub and others.

Gyaltsab Je and Kedrub Je inherited the throne of Master Tsongkhapa and ascended to Ganden Tripa (the head of Ganden Monastery, that is, the Dharma King of Yellow Hat school), which laid the foundation of Gelugpa School.

They were the two most outstanding disciples who carried forward the teachings of Master Tsongkhapa.

Master Tsongkhapa, Gyaltsab Je, and Kedrub Je were later honored as "Three Masters of Tsongkhapa".



Section 3 - of other writings on the stages of the path 

1. Other writings on the stages of the path If we understand the "The Graded Stages of the Path to Enlightenment", we will understand the sequence of the Path to Enlightenment, and we will understand how we will practice in the future.

Guang Lun is our teacher and mentor.

My guru, Dharma King Yongzeng's teacher, was Rako Rinpoche. After Rako Rinpoche's teacher passed away, he wrote a letter to another great siddha saying, "To my teacher who taught the scriptures. After passing away, I want to find another guru, which one do you think is more suitable?" 

The great siddhi replied, "Master Tsongkhapa's "The Graded Stages of the Path to Enlightenment" and "The Stages of the Path of Tantra" These two works are your best teachers.

"Therefore, we need to realize the greatness of the Cantonese Theory. If we practice according to the order in the Cantonese Cantonese, we will definitely achieve success. It depends on whether we believe it or not, whether we study it or not, whether we practice or not, and whether we can be diligent or not.

This is because "The Graded Stages of the Path to Enlightenment" mainly focuses on the cultivation methods of ordinary people, not only for those who have been incarnated as Bodhisattvas and those who are great achievers.

After Master Tsongkhapa wrote The Extensive Treatise on the Steps of the Path to Bodhi, a few years later, taking into account the foundation of all living beings in later generations, the master omitted the profound teachings in the Treatise and created the Brief Treatise on the Steps of the Path to Bodhi.


It focuses on the main points of practical training, and the emphasis of Professor Guang Lun is different. The two treatises can complement each other and Dharmacilitate future generations to study and practice.

At the same time, the master also realized that for practitioners in later generations, the teachings of these two treatises are still relatively broad, and some people may not know how to use these broader teachings for practice in the future.

Therefore, the Master graciously instructed: "Though there are very few people who can understand that all discourses are practice, you can first summarize the things that should be practiced, and describe them in detail in a separate book.

"After receiving such a promise from the master, the later great siddhas wrote books based on their own understanding of the "The Graded Stages of the Path to Enlightenment", and wrote hundreds of books before and after. There are eight chapters, called the Eight Great Guidances.

That is, Master Tsongkhapa's "A Grand Presentation of the Graded Stages of the Path (Lam-rim chen-mo)", "A Brief Review of the Steps of the Path to Enlightenment", and "Dao Song"; the fourth Panchen Lama's "The Path of Peace", referred to as "Le Dao"; the fifth Panchen Lama The Master's "Direct Teaching of the Path to Bodhi", referred to as "Speed ​​Path"; "The Path: Pure Gold" by the Third Dalai Lama; "Manjushri Dictation" by the Fifth Dalai Lama; The Essence of Good Speaking".

Among them, "Speed ​​Road" can be regarded as the annotation of "Le Dao", and "Manjushri's Dictation" can be regarded as the annotation of "Dao Ji Di • Pure Gold".

25

The basis of the Eight Great Guidance is also the "The Lamp of the Path to Enlightenment".

The masters who inherit the teachings of the eight great guides and other stages of the path belong to the creators of the three ways.

2. The Importance of the Succession of the Paths

 In the study of Buddhism, the purity of the stream of Dharma is very important.

The primary condition for the purification of the Dharma flow is that the Dharma learned and cultivated must be inherited.

Having a lineage refers to the Dharma that has been heard and practiced. It has been passed down from generation to generation by the lineage teachers, starting with Buddha Shakyamuni, without increase or decrease, until it is passed on to us.

With lineage, there will be blessings in practice.

The lineage includes different aspects, including the lineage of empowerment, the lineage of oral transmission, the lineage of sermons, and so on.

Oral transmission is the teaching of classics that the guru recites and wants to pass on to the disciples. The disciple listens carefully, and after listening to all of them, the continuum of the heart will get the lineage of oral transmission. When they cultivate to a certain life, they will suddenly think of everything that the master has recited. legality.

The lineage of sermons is the lineage of the sutras that the master has. Once he preaches the sutras to the disciples, the disciples obtain the lineage.

The lineage of our San Shi Dao and the Eight Great Guidance is the lineage of lecturing and oral transmission.

Our lineage is passed down by two great siddhis, Gyaltsab Je and Kedrub Je, disciples of Master Tsongkhapa.

26

It was passed on to the Fourth Panchen Lama, the fourth Panchen Lama is the reincarnation of the second coming of Master Tsongkhapa recognized in Tibet.

Then it was slowly passed on to the third Gongtang Rinpoche, and finally to Rako Rinpoche, Rako Rinpoche passed it on to Dharma King Yongzin, and Dharma King Yongzin passed it on to me.

I have studied under seven masters: Dharma King Yongzin, Dharma King Yeshe Gyatso, Guru Kazang Qusong Vajra, the 10th Panchen Lama, Gelga Rinpoche, Lobsang Dorje Vajra, and Geshe Rinpoche. Disciple of Rako Rinpoche.

So, our lineage is that of Rako Rinpoche.

I myself have received the lineage of the Three Paths and the Eight Great Guidances from Dharma King Yongzeng, and the Three Paths, The Extensive Treatise on the Stages of the Bodhi Path, and The Stages of the Bodhi Path from Master Gazang Qusong Vajra and Dharma King Yeshe Gyatso. The lineages of "A Brief Commentary" and "The Way of Peace" have also received other guidance from other masters. It is very important to have a lineage!

How to Learn the San Shi Dao 

#### Part 2

...

The essence of all the sutras is stored in the heart, and this Tao is one by one to hold in mind,

Speaking of the righteousness of the law, hearing the victory of virtue, this collection is the most important thing to think about.

Do all the good and good deeds, the wonderful karma is always the source,

Demonstrating that the Taoist and virtuous practitioners are diligent and courageous, willing to follow the truth,

Judging by the knowledge that he is not willing to give up his life, he obeys the teaching and performs the teacher's joyful offering.

I am always working diligently, and those who are determined to get rid of it should be encouraged!

..........

Chapter 1 - The root of the Path is to be close to the guru.

The guru is the teacher who preaches the sutras and the Dharma, is the good teacher, the source of all good virtues, the teacher who acts for the Buddhas, fulfills the responsibilities that the Buddhas have not fulfilled, and guides the liberation of all living beings. Therefore, the guru is the root of the Path.

Choosing a teacher is very important. To learn the Three Ways, you must first respect the guru, because the guru is not only the guru in this life, but also the reliance of future generations. Therefore, worshiping a guru is a great plan for all eternity. If you choose a good guru, you will benefit from it for eternity;

Choosing the right guru is also very easy to achieve. If you choose a guru who does not have the qualifications and virtues, you will have great troubles.

For example, disciples who have not reached the level of tantric empowerment may break their precepts after empowerment, and they will fall into evil realms in future generations. A truly good teacher will observe, and a disciple will not impart empowerment until he reaches the level of empowerment. The same is true of precepts. If the precepts are pure, the guru will pass them on. If the precepts are observed to be novel and fun, the virtuous guru will not pass them on.

If you worship a bad guru, or a guru who has not achieved success in learning and cultivation, and cannot deeply understand the Buddhadharma, you may teach and guide your disciples misunderstandings. When the master rejects other dharmas, the disciples also reject them; when the master says that a certain bodhisattva is not good, the disciples also say the same, and the disciples also follow the master to hell, and in the end they all fall into the evil realm.

Therefore, you must choose a good teacher, and you must not worship the teacher indiscriminately.

Choosing the right teacher is very, very important!

After choosing a teacher with virtue and qualifications, if you want to be a teacher who guides your own practice, you must also take refuge in this teacher.

First bow three times in front of the guru, and then follow the guru to recite the four refuges three times.

If you don't take refuge, you're not considered a master. Even if you listen to a certain guru teach the Dharma and participate in empowerment, you're not considered a master.

After worshipping a master, one must have firm confidence in the master.

If you can believe in the guru just like you believe in the Buddhas and Tathagatas, you can get the blessings of the Buddhas and Tathagatas in body, speech, and mind.

Our troubles are like cotton, the blessings of Buddhas and Tathagatas are like sunshine, and the blessings of teachers are like magnifying glasses.

32

The magnifying glass can gather sunlight to burn cotton, and so does the blessing of the guru. The blessings of the Buddhas and Tathagatas converge on us through the guru, and troubles will soon be cut off.

33

Section 1 - Qualifications of a Guru

 The guru we want to worship, in general, needs to meet five conditions: pure precepts; perfect understanding of the Dharma; great kindness and compassion; pure lineage; understanding of emptiness.

1. Basic requirements for a guru 

(1) Purity of the precepts 

As a guru, the precepts must be pure.

If the guru is a monk, then the monk vows must be pure.

Tibetan Buddhist monks have 253 precepts, all of which must be pure.

If the teacher has received the Bodhisattva Precepts, the Bodhisattva Precepts has eighteen fundamental precepts and forty-six secondary precepts, and these precepts must be pure.

Likewise, if one takes the Tantric precepts, the fourteen fundamental precepts and eight falling precepts of the Tantric vehicle must also be purified.

Purity of discipline is the first condition of being a guru.

(2) Fully understand the Buddhadharma

 There are 84,000 Dharma gates, and as a guru, one must understand the various points

34

The way of the party.

It is necessary to understand the method of sutra, otherwise, it will be misunderstood and rejected.

These are all slander, and are extremely bad karma.

Being able to fully understand the Dharma is the second condition for being a guru.

(3) Masters with great compassion and great kindness must have a great compassionate heart that wishes all sentient beings to have happiness and the causes of happiness, and a great compassionate heart that wishes all sentient beings to be free from suffering and the causes of suffering.

You must teach the Dharma for the sake of saving sentient beings with compassion, not for the sake of Dharmame and fortune.

(4) Purity of Lineage

 Guru must have a Lineage, not only the Lineage, but also the Lineage must be pure.

Our Lineage is from Sakyamuni Buddha to Manjushri Bodhisattva and Maitreya Bodhisattva, and slowly to Venerable Atisha, Master Tsongkhapa, and then from Gyaltsab Je and Kedrub Je to the fourth Panchen Lama. , the third Gongtang Rinpoche, and finally to Rako Rinpoche, and Rako Rinpoche to Dharma King Yongzin.

35

From Buddha Shakyamuni to Venerable Atisha was the lineage of the Great Prajna Sutra. During that period, the deep and broad paths were transmitted separately.

Beginning with Venerable Atisha, the lineages of the deep and broad stages were combined into one.

In this way, for the lineage of the entire Bodhi path, from Buddha Shakyamuni to Dharma King Yongzeng is the forty-fifth generation, and Dharma King Yongzeng passed it on to me, the lineage is very pure and complete.

It has been more than 2,500 years since the birth of Buddha Shakyamuni, and the reason why the lineage of the path has only gone through forty-five generations is that in the lineage of the Bodhi path, many lineage masters have lived in the world for a long time.

For example, Nagarjuna Bodhisattva lived for over 600 years, his disciple Yueshen Bodhisattva lived for over 350 years, and there are many other long-lived lineage masters.

The lineage of other dharmas has already exceeded forty-five generations.

Purity of lineage  is extremely important.

The pure lineage means that the Dharma taught by the guru started from Buddha Shakyamuni and passed down from generation to generation without increase or decrease.

In the process of teaching the Dharma, the master's own understandings and concepts were not added, or some masters thought they were wrong, and then eliminated the Dharma meaning of the lineage; and each generation of the masters of the lineage never gave up on their own masters. confidence.

Now, when many masters teach the Dharma, they will consciously or unintentionally add their own opinions and ideas, and pass them on to their disciples, such as "What do I think?" and so on.

36

This kind of master loses the pure lineage, or destroys the cleanliness of the lineage, so the Dharma handed down is not pure and complete.

The San Shi Dao that I teach you is passed down from the masters of the past generations, until my master passed it on to me and taught it to me, and it has been passed down to you in its entirety. ", and then added are all the Dharma passed down by Buddhas and Bodhisattvas, and what ordinary people think is not necessarily the Dharma.

Having a lineage, and the lineage is pure and complete, is the fourth condition for being a guru.

(5) Understanding emptiness

 Understanding emptiness means being able to understand emptiness through words and language.

As a teacher, it is best to realize emptiness.

Because the root of liberation is the realization of emptiness.

If you don't realize emptiness, you must at least understand emptiness. If your teacher doesn't understand emptiness, you can't talk about emptiness, and you can't guide your disciples on the path to liberation.

These are the five basic conditions that you need to have to be a guru.

37

There is a difference between a teacher and a guru. A teacher needs to meet the above five conditions, and a teacher must have the will and wisdom to save all sentient beings. The "Master" we usually say does not necessarily have to meet these conditions.

Therefore, when taking refuge in Tibetan Buddhism, one must take refuge in the guru; the main purpose of the practice of Theravada Buddhism is to save oneself, so the master of Theravada is called the teacher, not the guru.

In general, if you want to worship a guru, you must worship a guru who meets the above five conditions.

Guru can be divided into precept masters, Mahayana masters, and Tantric masters, all of which have different requirements.

2. The conditions for the teacher to teach the precepts require that the teacher who imparts the precepts and the precepts refers to the teacher who transmits the precepts of other and liberation, such as the teacher who transmits the five precepts, the novice precepts, and the monk precepts.

A precept master also needs to meet five conditions: purity of precepts; knowledge of disciplines; compassion; purity of residence; knowledge of timing.

(1) Purification of precepts

 As a teacher of precepts and precepts, first of all, he must have received and held the precepts of monks, and he must pass ten years of precepts.

38

Not only should the discipline be pure, but the precepts should also be pure.

For example, when you wear a cassock, you need to dress very standardly and not casually.

Precepts and tenets must be pure.

(2) Masters who are familiar with the precepts and precepts must be familiar with the prescribed requirements of the precepts.

For example, it is necessary to understand what is abstinence and what is a violation of the precepts; if one violates the precepts, how to repent and remedy them, etc.

Another example is when preaching the Five Precepts, it is required to be able to recite the rituals for preaching the precepts, and not to read out according to the original text.

Mastering the requirements of these precepts is called mastery of the discipline.

(3) It is absolutely impossible to have compassion without compassion.

 Without compassion, you are not qualified to be a guru.

(4) The place of residence is clean.

 The place of residence is clean, that is, the environment in which the masters who teach and give precepts live should be clean.

This means that the master's living environment and interpersonal interactions should not affect his own precepts, such as living in a clean place such as a monastery, a mountain or a forest.

39

(5) Know the timing

The timing of preaching precepts and teaching the Dharma must be all about timing, as well as seasonal regulations, the appropriate age for precepts, the length of time for offenders, etc. The timing requirements stipulated in the precepts must be mastered.

For example, it is necessary to understand the age rules for giving ordination.

One must be twenty years old to receive the ordination of a monk, and seven years old to receive the ordination of a novice. The preceptor must know this.

The above are the five conditions that must be fulfilled by the precepts and ordination guru.

3. The condition of the Mahayana guru requires Maitreya Bodhisattva to say in the "Sutra of Majesty":

A good teacher must possess precepts, concentration and wisdom, Virtue is diligent and knowledgeable,

With right view and good explanation, full of compassion and patience.

The requirements for the masters of Mahayana lecturing and teaching are relatively high, and they need to meet ten conditions: possessing morality; possessing determination; possessing wisdom; profound knowledge; Be patient.


(1) The purpose of keeping the precepts with sufficient precepts is to use precepts to subdue the unruly mind, so precepts must be pure.

The precepts can be divided into three categories: 

the precepts of no liberation, 

the precepts of the bodhisattva, 

and the precepts of the tantric vehicle.

The precepts of no liberation include the Theravada precepts, the Upasaka precepts, the Upasaka precepts, the novice precepts, the novice precepts, the study precepts, the monk precepts, and the monk precepts.

Keeping the precept of liberation can subdue the evil karma of the body and mouth.

That is, the body must not kill, steal, or commit sexual misconduct, and the mouth must not speak lies, slander, double-talk, or slander.

Holding the Bodhisattva Precepts can subdue the sinful karma of body, speech, and mind, especially the mind, which is the mind.

For example, to subdue miserliness, it is required not to be miserly in wealth, nor to be miserly in Dharma, which is a matter of body and mouth; it is also required to practice generosity frequently, all of which are aimed at subduing the miserliness.

The eighteen precepts of the Bodhisattva Precepts are mainly methods for subduing the mind.

The precepts of the tantra are also methods of subduing the mind.

When these three precepts are purified, they will naturally subdue the body, speech, and mind.

Precepts can completely subdue the body and mouth, but not the mind. The way to completely subdue the mind is to meditate.

41

(2) Having sufficient determinate form, sound, smell, taste, and touch, is called external environment. Having samsara and being unaffected by external conditions means having sufficient determinateness.

As a teacher, the mind must be able to settle down, and if you have the ability to meditate, it will be even more extraordinary.

Many of our lineage masters have the skill of meditation.

If you don't have the ability to meditate, you need to keep your mind stable at all times and not be troubled by external disturbances.

(3) There are many kinds of wisdom with wisdom, which here refers to the wisdom of distinguishing right from wrong.

As a teacher, you must have a strong ability to distinguish between good and evil, and if you have the wisdom of emptiness, it will be even more extraordinary.

(4) As a teacher with profound knowledge, one must be able to fully understand the Dharma.

First of all, you must master the methods of Theravada, then learn the methods of the Mahayana Buddhism, and then learn the methods of the Tantra, all of which must be learned.

In Tibetan Buddhism, it takes about sixteen years to learn the methods of Theravada and Mahayana sutras first.

During these sixteen years, the master has to teach the scriptures every day, and the disciples have to recite it every day, and then learn and master it by debating the scriptures. Next, it takes seven or eight years to learn the tantra method.

42

All in all, even if he is very diligent, an ordinary Tibetan Buddhist monk needs to study for more than 20 years before he can become a guru.

Not only that, as a guru, one must also master the teachings of the Tripitaka and the Five Mings.

The ten studies of the Five Ming and Ming Dynasties include astronomy, geography, medicine, and technology, etc. In Tibet, the knowledge is in the monasteries, and the good teachers who understand the knowledge are also in the monasteries.

Therefore, during the winter and summer vacations, there are always many students who come to the monastery to study.

If you are proficient in the Tripitaka, you will have deep knowledge; if you are proficient in all the Five Mings and Ten Learnings, you will have a broader range of knowledge.

As a guru, the most important thing is to be proficient in the essentials of the Tripitaka.

(5) Having the right view and the right view refers to the right view of the emptiness of the dependent origin, the right view of the person without the self, the right view of the law without the self, and so on.

The sutra says: 

"Virtues are more important than life, and right view is more important than morality.

"Without right view, it is impossible to have right faith, right thought, and right practice.

As a teacher, at the very least, you must understand emptiness, and it is better to realize emptiness. In this way, you have the right view of emptiness.

43

(6) Superior Morality and Ability

 As a teacher, it is very important to surpass the disciple in virtue and ability.

The Bodhisattva of Shiqin said in the "Collections of Relatives and Friends":

Those who worship the inferior will degenerate, those who worship the same will not make progress, those who worship the superior will make progress, and those who worship the superior should be teachers.

That is to say, if you worship a teacher whose morality is lower than your own, you will also degenerate; if you worship a teacher who is similar to you in all aspects, you will not make progress; only by worshiping a teacher can surpass your own teacher. , there will be progress.

Therefore, we should take refuge in a teacher whose virtues and talents are superior to our own.

Not necessarily in some special cases.

For example, none of Tsongkhapa's teachers surpassed Tsongkhapa in virtue and talent. Later, these teachers worshiped Tsongkhapa as their guru.

Master Tsongkhapa had more than forty teachers, the most outstanding is Master Rendawa.

When Master Tsongkhapa studied the five great treatises, most of the content was taught by Master Rendawa.

At the end of each lecture, Master Rendawa asked Master Tsongkhapa. He found that Master Tsongkhapa understood differently from himself. Master Tsongkhapa had a deeper and broader understanding. This was the case every time. .

44

So after finishing the five great treatises, Master Rendawa worshipped Master Tsongkhapa as his teacher.

Several other masters of Master Tsongkhapa later worshiped Master Tsongkhapa as their masters. There is such a situation in Tibetan areas, if the disciples are good in virtue, knowledge and achievements, they will worship the disciples as masters.

In general, the morality of the master must surpass that of the disciple.

(7) Diligence and hard work

 As a teacher, you must be diligent, study hard, and constantly improve yourself.

You must also be diligent in teaching your disciples, diligent in teaching the Dharma, diligent in practice, and diligent in all aspects.

(8) To be good at expository

 means to be fluent in teaching the scriptures and teaching the Dharma, so that you can speak freely and speak without hindrance.

The language should be able to express the content of the scriptures clearly and satisfaactorily.

(9) Compassionate Guru

 It is very important to have a compassionate mind, and it is a very necessary condition for the promotion of Buddhism.

45

A compassionate guru will affect the people around him, making people very relaxed physically and mentally, and they will be more receptive when teaching the Dharma, and the disciples will be more willing to get close to such a guru.

At the same time, because of his compassion for all beings, such a master will take the initiative to remove all kinds of obstacles when he propagates the Dharma, which is more conducive to the spread and promotion of the Dharma.

(10) Be patient. 

As a guru, you must be patient and not be annoying.

Because disciples have different abilities, qualities, habits, etc., they may be asked repeatedly when they are just starting out, or in the process of learning and cultivation. The master must be patient and never tire of asking questions.

To be a Mahayana teacher who teaches sutras and Dharma, one must meet the above ten conditions.

4. Requirements for a Tantric Guru: 

A master of tantra empowerment needs to have many more conditions than a Mahayana master. At least thirteen conditions must be met: 

Uphold the three righteousness; be full of wisdom; be patient; be upright; No fraud; understand medicine and mantra; have compassion; know scriptures and teachings; master double ten methods;

46

Right Mind:

Righteousness of heart is righteousness of mind.

(2) The wisdom of the tantric empowerment masters exceeds that of the Mahayana sutra masters. The ability to distinguish between good and evil must be very strong, and they must also have a very keen insight.

(3) Tolerance: 

To be able to endure humiliation, to be able to endure all kinds of hardships in the practice, and all kinds of hardships while teaching the Dharma.

(4) Upright character:

Tantric masters must be upright, have a kind heart, and cannot be cunning or scheming.

47

(5) No deception 

As a tantric master, one cannot deceive people.

There is no such thing as supernatural power, so you cannot say that you have supernatural powers. If you have not attained bodhicitta, you cannot say that you have bodhicitta, and you cannot deceive others.

(6) Understand Medicine

To be able to save all sentient beings, one must also be proficient in medical remedies and medicine in general.

In Tantra, there are many ways to use medicine to eliminate disasters, and some medicines and tantric incantations can be used to eliminate disasters.

So, as a tantric guru, it is very important to master these.

(7) Compassion 

A Guru who imparts precepts must have compassion, as should all Mahayana and Tantric masters.

To be a guru requires great compassion.

(8) Deep Knowledge of scriptures and teachings

One must be proficient in the teachings of the Mahayana and Hinayana Vehicles, as well as the teachings of the Sutra and Tantra.

As a Tantric Guru, it is a very important requirement to understand all the scriptures and teachings of Theravada, Mahayana and Tantra.

48

(9) Mastery of the Double Ten 

The Dharma of Tantra is divided into outer and inner tantras.

The outer tantras are of four classes.

Kriya tantra (bya-rgyud) – ritual deity practice

Charya tantra (spyod-rgyud) – behavioral deity practice

Yoga tantra (rnal-'byor rgyud)– integrated deity practice

Anuttarayoga (bla-med rnal-'byor rgyud) – peerlessly integrated (highest yoga) deity practice.

Three of these belong to the lower path.

Ritual, Behavioural, and Yoga.

The inner tantra refers to the tantra of the Supreme Yoga, and the double ten methods refer to the ten kinds of knowledge, skills and practices of the outer and inner tantras that the tantric master should be skilled or proficient in the use of.

The lower tantric masters must master the ten outer tantric methods, and the Supreme Yoga masters must master the inner tantric ten methods.

There are also many kinds of Bodhisattva sitting, such as lotus sitting and growth sitting.

Maitreya Bodhisattva's sitting method is the contemplative posture, Vajra Buddha's sitting method is lotus posture, and the essentials of these sitting methods must be mastered.

(6) Reciting what is appropriate to these two classes of tantra

There are six Dharma faults in reciting mantras incorrectly: speaking too fast; speaking too slowly; unclear pronunciation; inaccurate pronunciation; too loud; too soft.

If you recite mantras incorrectly, the blessing will be weak, so you must know how to recite mantras correctly.

Fire offering includes four kinds of fire offerings: pacifying, enriching, magnetizing, and wrathful. 

You must know how to perform these.

(8) Making the various other offerings

 You should be familiar with the methods of offering external, internal, and secret offerings.

Mahayana has only external offerings, and only Tantric schools have internal offerings and secret offerings.

Generally, people who do these bad things are because the devil and other demons are helping him.

Tantric masters must be proficient in isolation.

The above are the thirteen conditions that a master of tantric empowerment needs to meet.

#### Section 2 - Getting close to the guru

 After understanding the requirements for a guru, if you encounter a guru with these virtues, you must rely on him, listen to the scriptures, listen to the Dharma, and study hard.

During the period of study, you may encounter many teachers who are full of virtues. Then, you should rely on one teacher and then practice meditation;

How to choose this?

Both Thongtunpa and Sangpowa were disciples of the Venerable Atisha, and they were outstanding in every aspect.

Master Thongdunpa founded the Kadam School. Master Sangpowa was a great translator and has made great contributions to the spread of Buddhism in Tibet, but the way they relied on their masters is completely different.

Master Sangpowa had many teachers, and when he heard that there were people teaching the Dharma, he would listen to them.

On the way to meet Venerable Atisha, he heard that a layman was teaching the Dharma nearby, and he also went to listen.

His disciples all thought that they should not go. The disciples said, "To listen to the layman's teachings with your prestige is simply to damage your reputation."

Master Sangpowa said: "You can't say that. At least if I listen to it, I will have the merit of hearing it and rejoicing."

On the contrary, Master Zhongdumba has only five teachers, two in India, three in Tibet, and after the age of thirty-nine, he only relied on the Venerable Atisha.

58

So, which master's way of following a teacher is preferable?

Once, when the two masters Bodowa and Gombawa were together, they talked about this issue. In the end, they agreed that for the disciples who are just starting out, because their troubles are still more serious, they should look at the faults of others more than the merits and virtues of the master. If you haven't developed enough confidence to see your teacher as a Buddha, you should learn the way of relying on Master Zhongdunpa, and it is better to have less good teachers.

Now some people have worshipped many teachers, learned from everyone, listened to everyone's Dharma, and attended when they heard that there was empowerment.

For beginners, doing this is actually a taboo, and it is difficult to achieve success.

Beginners should rely on one or two masters, and study and practice in the order taught by the master. If the direction is right, the path will not go wrong.

1. How to get close to the guru 

After relying on the guru, you must get close to the guru. First of all, you must understand the contents of being close to the guru.

Getting close to the guru mainly includes three aspects: making offerings to the guru, serving the guru, and following the teachings.

59

(1) Offering to the Guru 

Offering is the most important method of accumulating merits, and offering to the Guru is especially extraordinary, because the Guru is the incarnation of the Buddhas and Tathagatas, and if you make an offering to the Guru, you will make offerings to all the Buddhas.

There are three types of offerings to the guru:

Wealth offering: 

All legally obtained wealth and items can be offered to the guru, but they must be done according to their own abilities.

Also, it would be better if the offering would please the guru, or if the offering was made with one's own beloved items.

This will also cultivate one's own equanimity and respect for the guru, and it is also a good way to obtain the guru's blessing.

Body, speech, and mind offering: 

It means offering one's body, speech, and mind to the guru.

Act as a teacher, take responsibility for doing things; speak for the teacher, pray and praise; think for the teacher, be pure and respectful, and correspond with the teacher.

Dharma offerings: 

After receiving the tantric empowerment, you have already made samaya vows and precepts with your guru. Therefore, you should practice diligently in accordance with the Dharma, and use your practice knowledge and practical actions to benefit sentient beings as offerings to your guru.

Among the three kinds of offerings, Dharma offerings are the most outstanding, body, speech, and mind offerings are second, and wealth offerings are the lowest.

60

(2) Serving the Guru 

Serving the Guru is actually a kind of body offering.

"Cheng" means to bear and take responsibility; "things" include all the things big and small that the guru has ordered to do, including not only the great undertakings of assisting the guru to spread the Dharma and benefiting students, but also including serving the guru in front of him. little things.

(3) The purpose of practicing Buddhism according to the teaching is to get rid of all kinds of troubles of oneself. In order to liberate and become a Buddha, it is also for this purpose to get close to the teacher.

After making offerings to the guru, if you do not earnestly practice the Dharma taught by the guru, you will not be able to liberate yourself.

Therefore, it is very important to listen to the teacher's teaching and follow it.

In addition, the disciple listens to the teacher's words, and practices according to the teacher's teaching.

61

2. The merits of offering and serving

 (1) The merits of making offerings to the guru 
 
 To make offerings to the guru, you must first know the merits of making offerings.

When you make offerings to the master, you make offerings to the Buddhas and Tathagatas.

In the Sequel to the Master of Victory Vajra, it says:

Live in the body of the teacher and accept the confession of believers.

what does it mean? This is to say that the four deities, such as the Victory Vajra, and the Buddhas and Tathagatas live in the body of the master and receive offerings from the disciples.

If a disciple makes offerings to the guru, it is equivalent to making offerings to the four deities, and thus making offerings to the Buddhas and Tathagatas.

When the guru accepts the offering, the Buddhas and Tathagatas receive the offering.

Therefore, making offerings to the guru is a great way to accumulate blessings.

If you only make offerings to Victory Vajra, then you can only make offerings to one deity; if you make offerings to Buddha Shakyamuni, you can only make offerings to one Buddha; if you make offerings to Amitabha, you also have the merits of making offerings to one Buddha.

However, if you make offerings to the guru, you will have the merit of making offerings to the Buddhas and Tathagatas!

"Sambhuza Tantra" is a fundamental tantra of the Supreme Yoga Department of Tantra. In "Sambhuza Tantra", it says:

A single pore on the teacher's body, the merit surpasses the merits of offering offerings to all Buddhas and Bodhisattvas in the ten directions.

This means that if you make an offering to a single pore on your guru, the merits and virtues will surpass that of making offerings to the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas of the ten directions.

For example, even rubbing a little oil on one of the pores of the guru's body is very beneficial.

There are many reasons for becoming a Buddha very quickly in the tantric method, and offering is one of them.

The offerings of tantra are mainly to make offerings to the guru, and if one makes offerings to the guru, one will make offerings to the Buddhas and Tathagatas.

The offerings of the Hinayana are mainly offerings to Shakyamuni Buddha, and the offerings of the Mahayana sects are Buddhas and Bodhisattvas. If you make offerings to a Buddha, you will only have the merits of making offerings to one Buddha; if you make offerings to a Bodhisattva, you will only have the merits of making offerings to a Bodhisattva, and you will not make offerings to others. The merits of the Buddha.

(2) The merits of serving the guru. 

What the guru should do, and the disciples help to do it, the merit of serving the guru is also very, very great.

The Huayan Sutra says: 

Serving the guru has incredible merit.

Venerable Atisha had many highly accomplished disciples, and there was one disciple named Anijang Qu Rinchen, who was an old man.

When he worshiped His Holiness as a teacher, he felt that he was very old and could not learn much about the Dharma. It was enough to serve the teacher well. He has been serving His Holiness for 17 years.

Later, among the disciples, he had the highest concentration and understanding.

Geshe Gon Bhawa once said:

"At that time, Ani served the guru, and Zhongdumba was the interpreter for the guru. I concentrated on practicing meditation, but later, both of them had higher concentration and understanding than me."

Geshe Sharaywa dedicated himself to serving his guru Shohwa.

One time, when he was cleaning the ashes, when he was carrying the ashes and was about to go downstairs to dump it, he suddenly realized all the essentials of the classics very clearly on the stairs, and he also had many magical abilities.

The Saban Teachings written by Sakya Pandita says:

After several kalpas of ascetic practice of prajna practice, giving of body, hands and feet,

The teacher's way is complete in an instant, and he is happy to worship the teacher's practice.

When Sakya Pandita was a child, he followed his uncle Drabajian to learn the Dharma.

When asking for Guru Yoga, Drapa Jianshen said:

"I can't pass on your Guru Yoga yet."

He asked, "Why?"

Zhaba Jianshen said: "Because now you can only see me as an uncle, not as a Buddha or Bodhisattva. Without this belief, it is useless to pass on it."

Afterwards, one time, Master Zhapa Jianshen was ill, and Sakya Pandita also suffered from the cold. Zhapa Jianshen said, "I can't move. Please take good care of me during this time."

64

In this way, although Sakya Pandita himself was suffering, he still did his best to serve the guru.

Three months later, Zhaba Jianshen said, "I can teach you Guru Yoga. I got sick to eliminate karma for you. Now, your karma has been purified."

After teaching the Dharma, Sakya Panzhida diligently practiced Guru Yoga, and soon became proficient in the Ten Great Dharma.

In fact, Buddhas and Bodhisattvas are everywhere, but sentient beings cannot see them. Why? It is because the karma of sentient beings is heavy!

Serving the guru can quickly eliminate karmic obstacles, and it is possible to see Buddhas and Bodhisattvas.

Serving a guru is a relatively easy way to achieve success.

When serving a teacher, you should treat your teacher as a Buddha or a Bodhisattva, who has the blessing power, and treat it as an ordinary person who has no blessing power.

There is no Guru Yoga in Sutra, only in Tantra.

The meaning of guru yoga is to visualize the indistinguishableness of the guru and the Buddha, the indistinguishability of the guru and the Buddha Shakyamuni, and the Buddhas and Tathagatas.

After contemplating in this way, because the guru is regarded as the Buddhas and Tathagatas, if you offer a cup of water to the guru, it is equivalent to offering a cup of water to the Buddhas and Tathagatas, not just one or two Buddhas.

In this way, in the moment of making offerings, there will be great merit, and in the moment of cultivation, many karmic obstacles will be eliminated, and great blessings will be accumulated.

65

Therefore, the Dharma door of Tantra is very special.

Xianzong does not have such a method.

In the sutras, if offering offerings to Amitabha Buddha, only Amitabha Buddha will receive offerings; if offering offerings to Shakyamuni Buddha, only Shakyamuni Buddha will receive offerings.

If you want to make offerings to the Buddhas and Tathagatas, you must make offerings one by one.

Therefore, under normal circumstances, if you want to accumulate great blessings in the practice of Theravada or Sutra, you must go through ascetic practice.

It is only possible after going through a lot of ascetic practices, even giving one's own body to all beings.

Guru Yoga, a tantric practice, does not need to go through ascetic practices, and it can also accumulate great blessings and eliminate many karmic obstacles.

(3) With what kind of heart to serve the guru 

When serving the guru, it will be more complete if you follow the "Nine Hearts of Respecting the Master" stated in the Huayan Sutra.

The nine hearts are:

The mind of a filial son is to regard the master as a parent, and as a disciple is a filial son, serving the master with the mentality of a filial son.

The "filial son" here is translated as "Shunzi" in Tibetan, and the word "shun" is highlighted, which means to obey the master's will.

66

Because people nowadays have strong ego-clinging, they are used to everything being self-centered, and they can do whatever they want.

To rely on the guru, one must throw away the ego and serve the guru like a filial son serves his parents.

When a dutiful son in ancient times wanted to do something, he would not do it according to his own ideas, but to observe his parents. If the parents were happy, they would do it, and if they were not happy, they would not do it.

The same is true when doing things for the guru. You must first observe the guru's face before making a decision.

Sometimes, it is not easy for the guru to speak directly about what the disciple is going to do, or it is inconvenient to say it at the time. At this time, if he sees that the guru is very happy, he approves; Whatever you say, don't stick to your own ideas.

It is also stated in the Sutra of Samadhi Now Realized by the Buddha:

He renounces self-righteousness in all things, and turns with the pleasure of a good teacher.

On this point, Master Tsongkhapa especially reminded: 

to act according to the will of the master does not mean that it must be done in front of any master, but must be in front of a master with virtue.

If the other party is not a real virtuous teacher, he cannot be led by the nose.

67

Vajra Heart 

The heart of relying on the guru is the vajra heart that never changes.
After relying on the guru, the heart of being close to the guru must never be shaken, and it can be as firm and indestructible as a vajra.

Whether it is a "demon" who destroys the Dharma-rectification, learning and cultivation, or an evil friend who slanders the teacher and slanders the Dharma, none of them can destroy or shake the dependence relationship between oneself and the teacher, leading to separation from the teacher.

"Magic" here refers to those who hinder study.

The scriptures say: "You should stay away. Friendship is impermanent, and affection is impermanent."

That is to say, in order to take into account the relationship and affection of some friends, you cannot follow them and prevent yourself from relying on your guru.

The center of the earth can carry anything, it can carry high-rise buildings, it can carry people and animals, it can also carry trees.
Whatever the guru has to do, as a disciple, you should have the courage to undertake it, that is, the "earth heart" that bears heavy responsibilities.

The earth's heart includes six aspects. Since you have made up your mind to take responsibility for your guru, you must do it from six aspects:

(1) Mountain Heart

The heart of the mountain is widely known as the heart of the Lunwei Mountain, and the Lunwei Mountain is the Tiewei Mountain.

The Tiewei Mountain firmly surrounds the saltwater sea in the middle, and the monstrous waves of the saltwater sea cannot shake or destroy the Tiewei Mountain.

At the end of the robbery, the robbery fire that can destroy all things cannot burn the Tiewei Mountain, and the violent storm is even less likely to shake the Tiewei Mountain.

Here, the mountain heart is used as a metaphor for the kind of perseverance that a disciple will never give up under any pressure or tribulation when he undertakes heavy responsibilities for the master.

(2) Servant's heart 

If what the guru instructs to do is relatively low, and think that it is not in line with one's own identity, don't feel embarrassed, hesitate, and do it decisively, that is the servant's heart.

Once upon a time, there was a gathering place for great translators and wise men in the back of Tibet. There was a mud flat there. Zhong Dunpa took off his clothes to clean up the mud, and then spread a layer of clean white clay. He was still in front of Venerable Atisha. Made an altar.

His Holiness was very happy when he saw it, smiled and said, "It's amazing that there are people like you in India, but Tibetan places are very rare."

In fact, as Zhongdumba, he could instruct others to do the dirty work, but he still did it himself.

That is to say, when serving the guru, as long as it can benefit the guru, no matter whether it is big or small, honor or disgrace, you must do your best.

69

(3) The people of the lower class are the people of the heart, which is widely called "the removal of the unclean people".

India has a caste system. This kind of people is a lower caste. Because they have lived at the bottom of the society for generations, they are very humble.

The subordination of the human heart means that when doing things for the guru, one should be respectful and not have any thoughts of "arrogance" and "too slow", and always maintain a humble attitude to serve the guru.

Master Zhongdunpa said: "I am slow to the high hills, and do not go out of the waters of virtue."

It means that arrogance is like the top of a mountain and cannot accumulate merit water.

Shu Owa also said: "At the beginning of spring, you should look at the high places on the top of the mountain, where the blue color grows everywhere, and the low places in the valleys and pits start first.

"It means that in early spring, looking at the tops and valleys, where the grass grows first, it must be the grass that grows first in the low-lying areas, and then slowly grows to the top of the mountain.

Therefore, it is said that only by being humble and low can you grow your merits. If I am slow to pay tribute to the higher, not only do I have no merits, but there are also faults.

(4) Chechengxin 70

Even if the task that the master asks to be done is very arduous, the responsibility is heavy, and it is beyond one's own ability, like a carriage that can bear the load, he must bravely undertake it, take it all down, and then find a way to complete it.

To be able to take on heavy responsibilities and to be the backbone of the master's preaching of the Dharma is to ride the heart.

(5) A righteous dog can endure humiliation and does not abandon his master, just like a righteous dog that never leaves its master.

Here is how to deal with the scolding of the guru.

When a disciple has made a big mistake, if the master wants to scold it, it is actually a good thing. Simply saying that the disciple may not listen to it, and will mistakenly regard the fult as a merit.

The teacher's scolding is a blessing. It should not be simply considered that the teacher lost his temper, nor should he be angry. As a disciple, you must have such wisdom.

There is a sentence in the "Eight Thousand Poems of Prajna", which is translated into modern language: If the master seems to scold the person who came to seek the Dharma, and then ignored it after scolding, in this case, the Dharma seeker Not only should people not give up, but they should also seek the Dharma more diligently.

Because the rectification of the Dharma is difficult to obtain, sometimes the guru does not teach the Dharma. It may be due to the fact that the disciple’s current blessings are not enough, and the precepts cannot be kept pure. At this time, the disciple must understand the guru and act according to the teacher.

71

(6) The heart of sailing the boat is not tired of doing anything for the guru, and is not afraid of trouble. This is the heart of sailing the boat.

No matter how heavy, numerous, troublesome, or repeated things the guru instructs you, you must persevere as a disciple, and you can't get bored or complain.

According to the biography of Venerable Milarepa, Guru Marpa asked Milarepa to build a house, and as long as he did it alone, no one else was allowed to help.

When it was about to be finished, he immediately picked on the Dharmault and asked him to dismantle it. After dismantling, he also asked him to put the stone back in its original place and arrange it properly.

It was built and demolished in this way, and it was demolished and built again. After going back and forth, I don’t know how many times, Milarepa carried the stone and worn out his back, and his bones were exposed.

But Milarepa persisted in this way, and thus eliminated the karma of killing thirty-five people and horses with the secret mantra in the past in order to avenge his parents. He achieved great achievements and became a Buddha in his lifetime.

The meaning of the heart of sailing is the same. The ship is loaded with goods and comes and goes at sea, constantly loading and unloading.

The disciple's commitment to the master should be like a sailing ship, not afraid of repetition, not bored, not complaining, and willing to bear it.

72

Master Tsongkhapa simply divided the nine hearts into four parts: The first part, when getting along with the teacher, pay attention to observe and understand the teacher's will, and obey the teacher's will, which is the heart of filial piety.

The second part, after relying on the guru, pay attention to cherish and protect the dependence relationship with the guru, so as not to be damaged by the alienation of those who slander the master and slander the Dharma, which is the vajra heart.

The third part is to respect the master's cause of spreading the Dharma and benefiting students, to undertake all the important responsibilities for the master, to keep diligent and never slack off, which is the earth's heart.

In the fourth part, the earth heart is divided into six areas: The unshakable belief in doing things for the guru is the mountain heart.

When doing things, no matter the big or the small, being able to do it yourself is the servant's heart.

To be humble and low-key when doing things is to be down-to-earth.

Being able to shoulder heavy responsibilities when doing things is the heart of the car.

To be able to endure the master's scolding when doing things is a righteous dog's heart.

Being able to do things without fear of trouble and repetition is the heart of sailing.

When serving the guru, use the nine hearts to observe, compare and guide yourself, the merit will be great, the blessing will be great, and the progress will be faster.

73

3. The merits of devotion and devotion There are three kinds of merits of devotion and devotion to the guru: natural blessing; spontaneous understanding; accelerated achievement.

(1) Naturally, if you are blessed with sincerity and sincerity to your guru, you will naturally receive the blessings of your guru and all the Buddhas and Tathagatas.

Master Bodova has a book called "The Blue Treasure Book", which is the most famous work of the Kadam School. The "Blue Treasure Book" says:

The strength of the guru's blessing is not the guru's own.

What is the size of the Guru's blessing? It mainly depends on the sincerity of the disciple.

If the sincerity of the disciple is very great, the blessing of the guru will be very great, and the blessing of the Buddhas and Tathagatas will be very great.

If the sincerity of the disciple is not enough, he will not be able to receive the blessing of the master. Even if the master is the incarnation of Manjushri Bodhisattva or Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva, it is useless, and it is useless for Buddha Shakyamuni to speak the scriptures personally.

The greater the sincerity, the greater the blessing.

The Five Kagyu Laws also say:

On the four-body snow-capped mountain of the master, if the sunshine of faith does not shine,

The nectar of blessings will not flow out, and you should make more efforts in faith and vows.

It shows that the strength of the disciple's blessing from the guru depends entirely on the strength of the disciple's belief and vows, that is, the strength of devotion to the guru and the strength of the will to pray for the guru's blessing.

(2) Self-generated comprehension

A devout and reverent teacher, you must comprehend the real truth because of faith, understanding, and understanding is not enough. Only when you understand it can it really work.
Knowing and realizing are different. Knowing that you only gained the wisdom of hearing, realizing that you have obtained the wisdom of thinking, and realizing that you have obtained the wisdom of cultivation.

For example, we all know the suffering of the six realms of reincarnation, and we understand the impermanence of life, but we still have a lot of troubles in our hearts, why?

Because I only understand those truths on the surface, but I haven't deeply realized and experienced them in my heart.

For another example, if we realize the suffering of becoming one of the three sufferings, we can truly feel the suffering of being without support, and realize that apart from Buddhas and Bodhisattvas, everything else is unreliable.

At this time, if someone does something against their will, they will not be troubled or suffer, but they will realize that people and things in the world are like this, and they are inherently unreliable, so why bother.

In this way, you can truly let go of your worries.

With devotion and devotion to the guru, your understanding will naturally increase, and you will realize many truths, until you realize that there is no ego in human beings and emptiness.

In addition, if the disciple's sincerity is great, and the confidence in the master is high, understanding will naturally arise, and understanding will be enhanced.

The Kagyu Master Guocangwa has achieved very high achievements. He said:

High faith and aspiration, high comprehension, medium faith and aspiration, medium comprehension,

The power of faith is low and the understanding is low. Correct faith is very important.

If you have high faith and aspiration, your comprehension will naturally improve. In the end, your comprehension will be very high, you will realize a lot of truth, and you will eliminate a lot of troubles.

For example, a water glass, once you realize its true nature, will not have the trouble of breaking the water glass, and will not be attached to it.

Master Wensaba is an important patriarch of Gelug's teaching method. Like Venerable Milarepa, he has attained the perfect status of Double Luck Vajra Holder and attained the Vajra body of immortality, but he is not like Milarepa. Ba has been practicing asceticism for a long time, but he has achieved success very easily.

Master Winsaba said:

The high and low levels of enlightenment and enlightenment depend entirely on the power of meditation, faith, and aspiration.

76

This is the experience of Master Wensaba, which shows that the key to the master's achievement is that through meditation on the power of faith and aspiration to the master, the understanding is improved, and the achievement is achieved.

The Seventh Dalai Lama also said:

To promote the realization of achievement, the guru's blessing is the most powerful, which in turn relies on the power of faith and vow, because prayers must be made sincerely.

In a word, the greater the faith in the guru, the greater the blessing; the greater the blessing, the greater the understanding; the greater the understanding, the greater the achievement.

Therefore, the power of faith and aspiration triggered by devotion to the guru is the secret to generating enlightenment. If the power of faith and aspiration reaches a certain level, it will naturally induce a sense of enlightenment.

The power of faith and vows is high, and Nagarjuna Bodhisattva has five disciples, one of whom is named Longbodhi, who has great faith and vows to Nagarjuna Bodhisattva.
Once, Nagarjuna Bodhisattva was tired and spit out some saliva. He immediately took it with his hands and ate it as the nectar blessed by the Bodhisattva. His comprehension improved immediately, and he realized emptiness the next day.

This is the behavior of a person with a very strong faith and will. If the faith and will is not at this level, it is useless to do so.

77

Once, Naropa was walking with his master Tilopa, and Tilopa brought Naropa to a tomb, and there was a dead body in the tomb, and Tilopa brought the rotten head of the corpse, Put it in a kabbalah, hand it to Naropa and say, "If you have enough faith in me, you can eat it, and if you don't have enough faith, don't eat it."

Master Naropa's faith and sincerity in Master Tilopa was very great, so he ate it and achieved it in his lifetime.

There are some Buddhists in Tibet who take back the water that the master used to wash his feet and face, and use it to wash his face and bathe, hoping to get the blessing of the master.

It is not impossible to do this, but it depends on whether the devotion, faith and aspiration to the guru are enough. If it is not enough, it will not work. If it is enough, using these things can improve the understanding.

(3) Accelerated achievement Respecting the guru with devotion will accelerate achievement, and achievement will be quick.

Master Tilopa said:

That is, the body achieves the vajra practice,

The ultimate way is the way of teachers,

The highest faith teacher.

By honoring the guru with the highest faith, the achievement will continue to improve.

The supreme belief is to see the guru as a real Buddha, a living Buddha.

When one's belief is raised to this level, one can get the blessings of both big and quick, and it will be accomplished very quickly.

Even just visualizing the guru without practicing the Dharma can be accomplished.

Master Yanggongpa, a very accomplished guru of the Kagyu school, said:

The master does not teach a single sentence of the Dharma, 

the disciple does not meditate once,

 and once he becomes a Buddha, 
 
 he believes in the master's path.

That is to say, when the sincerity of the disciple is so great that he can see that the teacher is a real Buddha, a living Buddha, even if he does not meditate or recite sutras, he will achieve success.

Guru is Buddha! 

A master is a living Buddha! 

It is very, very important to cultivate and consolidate this belief!

4. The merits of shaping the image of the guru 

In "Atisha Form Continuity", it says:

To build an image of a guru, the merit is far better than,

To make countless images for countless Buddhas.

It shows that the merits and virtues of sculpting the statue of the Guru are far greater than the merits and virtues of sculpting countless Buddha statues.

Offering a photo or image of the guru has the same merit.

Reverently sculpting the image of the guru is the same as sculpting the statues of Buddhas and Tathagatas. It is amazing. For example, offering a photo of a guru is equivalent to offering images of Buddhas and Tathagatas, but it must be an image of one’s own guru to have such merit. Because this is the origin of the heart-to-heart connection between the master and the disciple, and it is a very special origin.

When Master Tsongkhapa built Ganden Monastery, most of the Buddha statues and mandala were ready, only the Buddha statue in the middle of the hall had not been built.

Master Tsongkhapa said: "Disciples, this Buddha statue is up to you to build."

Everyone discussed: 

What is the best way to build this most important Buddha statue? Finally, all the disciples agreed to build a statue of Shakyamuni Buddha.

At this time, both Sera Monastery and Drepung Monastery chose the image of Master Tsongkhapa as the main Buddha statue in the center of the hall.

After the Buddha statues of the three major monasteries were all built, Master Tsongkhapa said: 

"It is very good to build the Buddha statue of Sakyamuni in Ganden Monastery, but Drepung Monastery and Sera Monastery built my statues. In the future, the Dharma relationship of Ganden Monastery will be inferior to that of Sera Monastery and Drepung Monastery.”

Later, it turned out to be the case. Ganden Saichi was the throne of Master Tsongkhapa. Those who sat in this position were equivalent to the leader of the Gelug sect. They were all the best teachers in the three monasteries. Among them, the most came from Sera Monastery and Drepung Monastery. Yes, there are very few from Ganden Monastery, because of the origin of the statue of the master.

80

The origin of the statue of the guru is very good, and the statue of the teacher is the statue of the Buddha.

Therefore, in the Great Sutra Hall of Tuola Temple, there are statues of Dharma King Yongzeng, Jiayang Xieba, and many teachers.

5. The merits of missing and praying

 the merits of praying to the guru, including the merits of thinking of the guru and the merits of praying to the guru.

(1) Remembering the merits of the guru

In the case of the opposite, thinking of the master is better than thinking of the Buddhas. The merit of thinking of the master is to visualize the merit of the Buddhas and Tathagatas, and it is to visualize the merit of the deity.
Sometimes, if it is difficult to visualize the deity, just visualize the guru.

The Canon of Oaths says:

81

With a dignified body, contemplating a hundred thousand kalpas,

It's not as good as a moment to miss the teacher.

This means that contemplating the Buddha's thirty-two and eighty-sixty appearances, or the appearance of a bodhisattva or deity for 100,000 kalpas, is the same as thinking of the guru for a moment.

Therefore, the merit of thinking of the guru is very, very great! Many people say, "I can't visualize the deity, nor can I visualize Shakyamuni Buddha."

In this case, it is enough to visualize the guru.

Sometimes it's a little more difficult to visualize the guru, and that's the reason for karma.

When some people meditate on the guru, they can't remember what they think. Even the guru has just given them empowerment, but they even forget the guru's face. This is because the karma is relatively heavy.

In terms of practice, the master of contemplating the practice of the master is better than practicing Tantra, the second and second master Guo Cangwa said:

Although there are many stages of generation, the method of visualizing the master is the best.

It is also stated in the Atisha Form Continuation:

Give up sleep and hustle and bustle,

 and meditate on the path of perfection through eons.

No more than an instant in my mind, visualize the tenth of the masters.

Whether our practice can be successful or not depends on two aspects. The first aspect is to see if one has achieved Guru Yoga, and is able to visualize that the Guru and the Buddha are indistinguishable. When there is a belief in the mind that "the guru and the Buddha are indistinguishable", the achievement will be very Dharmast.

The second aspect is to practice the second stage of Tantra on the basis of the achievement of Guru Yoga, so that one can quickly become a Buddha.

At this time, if you visualize any deity, such as King Matou Ming, as long as you visualize the same as the master, there will be blessings, and there will be two kinds of blessings, big and quick.

If we only have faith in Buddhas and Bodhisattvas, due to our heavy karma, no matter how great the blessings of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas are, it will be difficult for us to obtain them, and achievement will be slow.

For future generations, it is easier to be reborn in the Pure Land when you miss your guru. The merits of missing your guru are very, very great, especially when you are dying. If you can miss your guru, you will definitely be reborn in the Pure Land. This is 100%!

The tantra classic "The Good Army Request Continuation" says: "When a person is dying, he can transfer his consciousness to rebirth when he misses his teacher."

Buddhist practitioners, if they do not achieve success in this life, when they die, no matter how heavy their karma is, as long as they can remember their guru, and through the power of faith in the guru's Three Jewels, they will surely be able to transfer their consciousness to rebirth. Outstanding.

83

Tibetan Buddhism has the Powa method of transferring consciousness to rebirth, and the Chinese have the method of reciting Amitabha Buddha, but if you don’t accumulate a certain amount of merit, you may not be able to successfully be reborn in the Pure Land, because when the bad karma is too heavy, you will be drawn by the bad karma. will fall into evil.

Therefore, relying on oneself may not really be able to be reborn in the Pure Land.

However, when you are dying, if you can really think of your guru and miss your guru, you will definitely be reborn in the Pure Land!

In terms of career, it is easier to miss the guru as you wish. If you miss your guru often, your career will be as wishful and easy to accomplish.

The Tibetan version of the Huayan Sutra says:

Always keep the teacher in mind, 

everything is easy to accomplish.

The same is true for the cause of Buddhism. If you miss your guru often, you will easily get the blessings of the Buddhas and Tathagatas.

Master Tsangpa Gyare once said:

As long as the mind does not leave the teacher,

Even if you don't read scriptures,

Even if you don't know how to meditate.

As long as you think of your guru, 

you will be successful if you don't read sutras or meditate.

Because only through the guru can the blessings of the Buddhas and Tathagatas be obtained, and because of this dependent origin, as long as the mind does not leave the guru, one can always obtain the blessings of the Buddhas and the Tathagatas.

84

(2) Praying for the guru's merits

 Often praying to the guru, such as reciting the guru's prayer, the merit is also very, very great.

Because reciting the guru's prayers is the same as reciting the prayers of the Buddhas and Tathagatas, so there is such a great merit.

Master Guocangwa said that it is better to pray to the master once to recite the mantra thousands of times.

Reciting the guru's prayer once is the same as reciting the mantra thousands of times.

We can also recite Master Tsongkhapa's prayer:

Mingmei blames Wei for seeing the hot color in person, 

Zhimai is more sad than Wang Wujiang,

Duhong Ma Lu Jiong Zai Sanweed, 

Gangchen Kebezujian Tsongkhapa,

Lausanne Zabechara Sowadi.

Frequently reciting the prayers of Master Tsongkhapa will have the merits of reciting the prayers of all Buddhas, Tathagatas, lineage masters, and root masters. It is very, very special.

85

6. The merits of the Buddha's reverence 

(1) The guru is the prophecy of the Buddha according to the scriptures, and all masters with virtue are the manifestations of all Buddhas and Bodhisattvas.

For example, in the "Baoji Sutra: The Meeting of fathers and Sons", the Buddha said:

After I attain Nirvana, I shall transform into the body of a guru to benefit all sentient beings.

...

When I appear in the body of a master, I also appear in the form of birth, old age, sickness and death.

"Second Observation Continuation" says:

At the end of the Dharma, I am now a master.

The Vajra Sutra says:

At the end of the turbid world, I appeared to be a good teacher and spoke.

The Vajra Body Tantra says:

Originally a Vajrasattva, for the benefit of all sentient beings, 

he is now an ordinary teacher.

86

...

For the last five hundred kalpas, 

I am now the master,

Treat it as a vajra holding and treat it with respect.

Before the Buddhas became Buddhas,

In order to become a Buddha, 

one must make a vow,

Only when the willpower is mature,

to become a Buddha.

For example, making a vow: 

"After I become a Buddha in the future, 

I will save all sentient beings."

Therefore, after becoming a Buddha, he will surely come to save us.

When the blessings of human beings are very great, the Buddha can manifest himself in person to save sentient beings; when the blessings of people are small and greed, hatred and delusion are very great, even if the Buddha appears, sentient beings will not be able to see it.

So, what method is used to save sentient beings? The Buddha merged into the body of the master to save sentient beings.

Many times, the Buddhas and Tathagatas merge into the body of the guru, or transform into the image of the guru to save sentient beings.

Therefore, the disciple should regard the guru as the Buddha.

Treat your guru as a Buddha and you will receive the blessing of a Buddha; as a Bodhisattva, you will receive the blessing of a Bodhisattva; as an ordinary person, you will have no blessing, because ordinary people have no blessing.

Some people have multiple masters. We are not sure whether these masters are all Buddhas, but according to Buddhist scriptures and tantras, due to the bodhisattva's vow to become a Buddha, at least one Buddha will be integrated into the master's. Physically, that's for sure.

As for which Buddha was integrated into the guru, or the body of which guru the Buddha integrated into, it is not certain.

87

Therefore, if we treat all the teachers we have taken refuge with as Buddhas, we will surely receive the blessings of the Buddhas and Tathagatas.

Sometimes, it is necessary to regard Buddhas, Bodhisattvas, and Buddhas as incarnations of teachers, and the merits of such visualization are even greater.

(2) The Buddhist scriptures on merit and virtue as viewed by the Buddha

 say: Believe in refuge is inconceivable, 
 
 and its retribution is also inconceivable.

To believe is to believe sincerely.

It means that the power of the Three Jewels of Believing in the Guru is incredible, and the good deeds and blessings obtained are also inconceivable.

Because the Buddha is inconceivable, the results obtained by taking the guru as a Buddha and taking refuge with sincerity are also inconceivable.

From this point of view, it is very important to take refuge in regard to the guru and the Buddha as one and the same.

There is a biography called "Jinwen Dawa Biography", which tells about the incarnation of a Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva. 

The biography says:

With one heart and one mouth, 

he regards the master as one Buddha, one body.

All good virtues develop the power,

 and all the disciples of the Buddha practice the Way together.

It means: to cultivate the heart of faith and refuge in the guru to the extent that it is consistent with the heart.

When we praise the guru as a Buddha in our mouth, and see the guru as a Buddha in our heart, we see that the guru and the Buddha are indistinguishable.

88

It is also stated in the Vajra Hand Empowerment Tantra:

Benefit all sentient beings, 

he is the Buddha,

With this thought in mind, 

all good things will arise.

Guru Marpa was majoring in the Hevajra deity. One morning, while Guru Marpa was still sleeping, his master, Master Naropa, manifested Hevajra in the sky, and then woke Guru Marpa. Said: 

"You get up now and go outside and have a look."

Master Marpa went out and looked at it and said, "It's nothing.

Master Naropa said: 

"Look into the sky. "

Master Marpa looked into the sky and saw Hevajra.

Master Naropa asked Guru Marpa, 

"If you want to bow down, do you want to bow down to me or the Hevajra first?"

Master Marpa thought: 

"The teacher is always in front of me, and there are many opportunities to bow to the teacher, but there are not many opportunities to bow to the Hevajra. 

I want to bow to the Hevajra."

Master Marpa gave the Hevajra three obeisances.

At this time, Master Naropa said, "Without a guru, there would be no Buddha, Bodhisattva, or yidam.

 Buddhas, bodhisattvas, and yidams are all transformed and manifested by a guru."

After he finished speaking, he took back Hejingguo and integrated it into his heart.

Then he said to Master Marpa, "In the future, the lineage of your descendants will not last long.

This morning, if you had bowed to your guru first, the continuation of the lineage of your descendants would have been very good, but you didn't. 

"It turned out to be so.

Guru and Buddhas and Bodhisattvas are indistinguishable, and when one bows to the master, one bows to the Buddhas and Tathagatas.

When Guru Marpa bowed to the Hevajra, he did not necessarily bow to Naropa, but if he bowed to Naropa, he bowed to the Hevajra.

When we cultivate Vajrasattva, we must visualize that Vajrasattva is indistinguishable from the guru, and is indistinguishable from the Buddhas, Tathagatas, and the four deities.

With this state of mind, reciting the hundred-syllable mantra once is equivalent to reciting the mantras of the Buddhas and Tathagatas, and is equivalent to reciting the mantras and fundamental mantras of the four deities.

If you don't have this mentality, you won't have so much merit when reciting the hundred-syllable mantra.

There are many kinds of Guru Yoga: 

Guru Yoga of Avalokitesvara is to visualize the teacher and Avalokitesvara as indistinguishable; Guru Yoga of Manjushri is to visualize the Guru and Manjushri as indistinguishable; Tsongkhapa Master's guru yoga is to visualize that the guru and Tsongkhapa are indistinguishable.

In any kind of guru yoga, the guru and the Buddha and Bodhisattva must be regarded as indistinguishable, and the guru and the deity are indistinguishable.

When practicing the deity, in order to obtain the corresponding, you also need to first practice guru yoga.

Vajrapani Bodhisattva once said to Master Nanka Gyaltsen:

90

"You should know that you have not yet cultivated great respect for your guru, but you are lying when you say that you have seen the deity in person and that understanding has arisen in your heart... Relying on your guru, you should treat your guru like a Buddha with confidence."

Therefore, we must understand that all the deities we meditate on are the manifestations of our masters. If we can’t cultivate in accordance with our masters, how can we correspond to deities? Only by practicing Guru Yoga and practicing the deity can you achieve rapid achievement.

The first emphasis of tantric practice is to take refuge in the guru and the Three Jewels. If there is no faith in the guru to be a Buddha, the practice of tantra will not be successful.

The blessing of the master is like an iron hook, and the disciple's faith and vows are like an iron ring. Without this ring, the iron hook cannot hook anything.

(3) The merits and virtues of the Buddha's reverence include the reverence of body, speech and mind.

Physical reverence includes prostration, prostration, and reverence in actions and behaviors when in contact with the guru; verbal reverence includes admiration and praise of the teacher’s virtue on all occasions, as well as reverence in words when talking with the guru.

Respect includes respect and love for the guru from the heart, and a heart of love and respect for the guru who sincerely takes refuge in the guru.

Since the guru is the incarnation of the Buddhas and Tathagatas, if you pay homage to the guru, you will have the merit of respecting the Buddhas, and you will be able to accumulate a huge amount of merit.

91

In particular, if you can develop pure faith in ordinary teachers and pay homage to the Buddha, in addition to increasing blessings, you can also get many incredible merits such as the mutual help of humans and gods.

Respecting the guru with body, speech, and mind is the source of all good virtues.

92

Section 3 - Sins of Disrespecting the Guru 

Not respecting the Guru is not respecting the Buddhas and Tathagatas, which is a very serious sin.

After worshiping a teacher, one must respect the teacher and do what the teacher says; do not disobey the teacher, let alone slander and slander the teacher.

Once a master-disciple relationship is established, if you have doubts about your guru, or have other impure thoughts or words and deeds, it is a very serious evil karma.

Especially after receiving the tantric empowerment, if you don't respect the guru, you will not only violate the tantric precepts, but also go to hell, and you will not be able to achieve it after countless kalpas.

The sin of disrespecting the guru is divided into three aspects: body, speech, and mind.

1. The sins of the body include the sins of disrespecting the guru, including the shadow of disrespecting the guru.

If you step on the guru's shadow with malice, it is equivalent to destroying a stupa.

In other respects, it is also a great sin to sit on the guru's cushion, throne, or to step on the guru's robe and bedding without the master's permission.

93

In the past, there were small living Buddhas who were mistakenly identified in the Tibetan area and were placed on the cushions of the large living Buddhas who had passed away. Because the blessings are not enough, it is also very pitiful.

2. The guilt of speech 

The guilt of speech includes two parts: slandering the teacher and violating the teacher's words.

No matter what the reasons are, the consequences of slandering and slandering the master are extremely serious. The result is that even the Buddha cannot bear to elaborate, and the future generations will definitely fall into the endless hell.

In the Vajrapani Empowerment Sutra, Vajrapani asked the Buddha, "Bhagavan, if there are those who despise Acharya, how familiar should they feel?"

The Buddha replied: "Vajra Hand, don't say anything like that, all the gods and the human world are terrifying! The secret master, of course, should say a little:

Warriors should listen carefully, I say no time to wait,

The hells of extreme suffering are where they are born,

Going there for boundless kalpas, therefore all species,

The teacher should not be underestimated,…”

The Buddha considered that if he answered Vajrapani in detail, it would cause great terror to all beings in the world, so he only said roughly that he would need to stay in the endless hell for many years.

94

Therefore, under no circumstances should one despise or slander the guru.

Not only can you not despise and slander your guru yourself, but it is also not good to contact and talk with those who slander your guru.

Even those who slander the guru in the dream will be regarded as unlucky.

As the tantra says:

Don't say anything to destroy the teacher, you don't want to see it in your dreams.

He also said: "Those who slander the guru will not only fail to practice tantra, but also their best friends will fail to achieve success."

Therefore, not only can you not make friends with people who detract from your guru, but you will also be affected by their evil spirits even if you approach them.

One must be careful when contacting fellow Vajra brothers. Even if it is a good friend, if he finds out that he has slandered or slandered the guru, he should persuade him with kind words and ask him to go to the guru to repent immediately, or stay away from him if he cannot persuade him.

Don't make up your mind because everyone has a good relationship, and finally break your own life.

(1) The sin of slandering the guru

Slandering the guru is the crime of slandering all the Buddhist scriptures that say:

For his savior, if his disciples slander him,

Because of slandering the Buddhas, their people suffer a lot.

95

The guru is the savior who frees sentient beings from the suffering of samsara. To slander the guru is to slander the Buddhas and Tathagatas.

Buddhas and Tathagatas transform into ready-made masters, or integrate into masters to save sentient beings. They are the greatest and most profound fields of blessing for sentient beings.

To make offerings to one master is to make offerings to all Buddhas, and to slander one master is to slander all Buddhas. This kind of bad karma will lead to all kinds of misfortunes, diseases, and disasters.

Slandering the guru, cultivating secret methods cannot be accomplished. Some people worship the guru and participate in the empowerment, and scolding the guru on the way back. This is a very, very sinful act!

Once you are a teacher, you cannot scold or slander.

If you want to scold or slander your guru, don't take refuge in that guru in the first place.

Slandering the guru, for example, the guru has a big temper, gets angry every day, and says that the guru is greedy, looks dignified, does things unfairly, etc. This is a great sin!

Those who have committed the five unrelenting sins have very heavy karma, and they will not be able to achieve the practice the Hinayana method, and it will be difficult to practice the method of the Mahayana sect.

If you practice tantra and have enough devotion to your guru, you can eliminate these sins and even achieve enlightenment in a lifetime.

96

However, those who slander, beat and scold the guru will not be able to achieve anything by cultivating! The Dense Vajra Root Tantra says:

Although the world has committed all kinds of sins that are inexhaustible and degenerate,

In the great ocean of the Vajrayana, cultivating and realizing this path will be accomplished,

Those who deliberately slander the guru will not succeed in cultivation.

It means that even those who have committed the five unrepentant sins can practice Tantra.

However, those who deliberately slander the guru will not succeed in cultivation.

In "Vajra Heart To Be Solemn" it says:

If one slanders the guru, although diligence is the best,

Let go of sleep disorder, and diligently cultivate in a thousand kalpas,

Also repair hell.

That is to say, if someone slanders his master, even if he did not sleep or wander for a thousand kalpas, and diligently practiced the most excellent methods of the four tantras, he would only be in the dark. That's why the evil of going to hell has been repaired.

Slandering the guru is not good for the present and future generations. The "Fifty Verses of the Guru's Dharma" says:
Those who slander the guru are prone to illnesses and disasters,

Haunted by poison, the Dharmans will die,

Official fire and poisonous snakes, water thieves and natural disasters,

Demons and ghosts, chasing their lives to hell.

This is the result of slandering the guru.

Since slandering the guru is slandering the Buddhas and Tathagatas, those who slander the guru will not only suffer from illness and suffering in this world, be poisoned or be haunted by ghosts, but even lose their lives due to being overtaken and deceived by ghosts, poisonous snakes, robbers, etc., will also be harmed by evil spirits and go to hell, which is not good for this life nor the next life.

To slander the master is to slander  the master of the vajra, and to slander the master of the vajra is the sin of slandering the Buddhas and Tathagatas.
Ungenerated merits do not arise again; merits that have arisen also disappear.

The vajra master mentioned here mainly refers to the master of tantric empowerment.

Just as the roots of a tree die, so will the branches and leaves of the tree.

The foundation of all merits and virtues is the power of faith in the guru. If you lose your faith in the guru and slander the guru, you will not only fail.

When achievement occurs, even the original merit will be lost.

(2) Sins of Violating the Master's Words 

The guru taught the disciples how to study. If the disciples don't do it, they can't follow the teachings, which means that they have violated the master's words.

What is the sin of violating the teacher's words?

Contrary to the teacher's words, there are many disasters in this life, and you will go to hell in the next life. "Vajra Account Tantra" is a Tantra of the Supreme Yoga Department of Tantra. The "Vajra Account Tantra" says:

Disciples who have received empowerment, 

if they violate the teacher's words, 

there will be many disasters in this life, 

and they will fall into hell in the next life.

After receiving empowerment, if you disobey the teacher's words, you will suffer many disasters in this life, and you will go to hell in the next life.

The teacher's words mentioned here are not ordinary teacher's words, such as the tantric precepts. After the master has empowered the disciples, the disciples have received and upheld the fourteen tantric fundamental precepts.

The master requires the disciples not to violate these precepts. If the precepts are violated, it is a violation of the master's words, and there will be sins of violating the master's words.

As Master usually says, disciples who disobey will also have karma, but there is no major karma.

Therefore, when we cannot do what Master said, we must explain the reasons to Master clearly.

99

For example, if the master asks the disciple to recite the one-hundred-syllable mantra one million times, the disciple has to think about whether it can be accomplished or not, and if not, he must explain the reason to the master, for example, he does not have that much time, etc., even if he admits that he is lazy, Saying "I'm lazy" works too.

If the disciple ignores it, he is also guilty.

If you don't listen to your guru, you won't get accomplished. Master Tilopa said:

If you don't listen to your teacher,

 you won't achieve success.

This sentence is very easy to understand. If you don’t listen to the teacher’s words and follow the teachings, you will naturally not achieve anything!

3. The sin of will

People who are just beginning to learn Buddhism, or those who have a very low level of diligence, have not yet firmed their confidence in the Three Jewels of the Guru, and they cannot control their thoughts, and their troubles will become heavier.

At this time, it is easy to have retreat or create karma.

However, if you also randomly guess and speculate about your teacher's words and deeds, and have all kinds of thoughts, or even get angry with the teacher and make him unhappy, the bad karma will increase.

100

(1) The sin of being angry with the guru 

The sin of being angry with the guru is stated in the Kalachakra Root Tantra:

The moment he was angry with the teacher, his good deeds were destroyed for a kalpa, and he was reborn in hell for several kalpas.

That is to say, if you are angry with your guru for a split second, the blessings of one kalpa will be eliminated, and you will go to hell after death, and you will have to stay in hell for several kalpas.

According to Theravada 

Theravada, a flick of the finger takes sixty-five "moments". Therefore, if one flicks a finger of anger toward a teacher or student, one will spend sixty-five kalpas in hell in the next life.

This is still the time calculated according to the Hinayana theory, and the time according to the Mahayana theory is even longer than this, we have to think about how terrible it is!

Anger towards teachers and students will also eliminate a lot of good fortune.

Except for the blessings of devotion, the blessings of bodhicitta, and the blessings of emptiness that will not disappear, other blessings will disappear.

So, don't get angry with the guru.

However, if you accidentally get angry with your guru, you should immediately repent to your guru, and your sins will be eliminated in an instant.

101

One month before Dharma King Yongzeng passed away, and two months before Master Gazang Qusong Vajra passed away, he informed all his disciples as much as possible of the news that he was going to pass away.

The two masters were very merciful, and they did this so that the disciples could have time to eliminate their karma and repent in time, or to deal with other unsatisfactory things.

If the guru passes away, it will be more troublesome. Only by visualizing that the guru and Vajrasattva are indistinguishable, and reciting the hundred-syllable mantra one hundred thousand times at the same time, can the karma of being angry with the guru be eliminated.

(2) The sin of looking for the guru's faults and defects is always looking for and paying attention to the guru's shortcomings or defects, which will reduce the strength of faith in the guru, and gradually lose confidence in the guru. In the end, a lot of merit will be lost. Lost, can not be achieved.

When the Buddha was alive, some people were taught by the Buddha himself to be tamed, but because they were always looking for the Buddha's shortcomings, they were not able to achieve it.

Shanxing Bhikkhu is one of the disciples of Buddha Shakyamuni. He doesn't look at the Buddha's merits, he only looks for the Buddha's faults, but he can't find any no matter how he looks.

He has been searching for twelve years, and finally found it: once, he saw Devadatta hitting Shakyamuni Buddha with a stone, and the Buddha's thumb was injured; another time, there was a thorn that hurt the sole of the Buddha's foot.


The Xing Bhikkhu did not understand that these things are all due to causation, but he just thought that if the Buddha's ability is the greatest and his merit is the most perfect, the Buddha should not be harmed.

In this way, because the monks of good stars often searched for the defects of the Buddha, they failed to achieve it in the end, and went to hell after death.

Later, the Buddha went to hell to save him. After seeing the Buddha, he developed confidence and the Buddha saved him from hell.

Why do I see the flaws and defects of the guru? Everyone feels different about the guru when they look at their guru. Some people look at the guru very frightened, some think the guru is not solemn, and some people think the guru is very solemn. ,mercy.
This is determined by the degree of purification of one's own karma, as well as the angle and prejudice of looking at the problem.

(1) Causes of Karma 

Sometimes, some people may think: "Since the guru is the incarnation of the Buddha, why is the guru still flawed? Since there are flaws, how can it be a perfect Buddha?"

In fact, what sentient beings see is unreal.

103

For example, although the Buddha is perfect, all living beings can only see Buddha Shakyamuni appearing in the form of a mortal person due to karma.

The flaws we see in our guru are also the cause of our own karma.

Everything in the eyes is the projection of karma, what kind of karma there is, what kind of appearance will be seen.

Since the minds of sentient beings are polluted by karma, everything they see is a polluted appearance.

Just as the image of the moon in clear and turbid water is different, it is the water, not the moon, that makes the difference.

In order to see the Compassionate Venerable, the Bodhisattva Asanga was Maitreya Bodhisattva, who meditated on the Compassionate Venerable for twelve years.

When the karma is not pure, he can only see Maitreya Bodhisattva as a rotten mangy dog.

Twelve years later, when the karma was eliminated, I saw Maitreya Bodhisattva.

After seeing the Bodhisattva, he complained, saying that he had cultivated for so long and worked so hard before he saw Maitreya Bodhisattva. Maitreya Bodhisattva said, "I've been by your side all the time, and it's because of your karma that you can't see it."

Seeing that Bodhisattva Asanga did not believe, Maitreya Bodhisattva said, "I'm sitting on your shoulder now. Go and ask other people what they have seen."

Then Maitreya Bodhisattva sat on the shoulders of Asanga Bodhisattva, and Asanga Bodhisattva asked people on the roadside to worship Maitreya Bodhisattva. As a result, everyone thought he was crazy and said that there was nothing on Asanga Bodhisattva's shoulders.

In the end, only one old grandmother said: "You have a mangy dog ​​with a rotten lower body on your shoulders, and there is no bodhisattva."

Only then did Asanga Bodhisattva believe the words of Maitreya Bodhisattva.

104

When Naropa was looking for his teacher Tilopa, the leprosy woman, the rotten bitch, etc. he saw along the way were actually the manifestation of his teacher Tilopa, but he didn't recognize him. Afterwards he was desperate because Tilopa finally appeared when he could not see his master and was ready to commit suicide.

Naropa said:

"Master, I searched so hard, why did you appear?"

Master Tilopa said, "I have always been by your side, and it is because of your bad karma that you do not recognize me."

The biographies of these patriarchs and great virtues are all living examples.

Therefore, it is the karma of sentient beings that obstructs themselves.

Although the guru possesses all the qualities of a Buddha, because the minds of sentient beings are blinded by ignorance, they cannot see that the guru is a Buddha. Instead, they will see that the guru has various flaws.

(2) Influence of perspective and prejudice 

On the other hand, when people look at problems, they are also affected by the angle from which they look at the problem and the prejudice produced by their own experiences.

For example, when looking at one's own children, shortcomings will be regarded as advantages. Even if the child has shortcomings or Dharmaults, they will not care. This is a matter of perspective.

When a lively person sees a silent person, he will have a prejudice that the other party is difficult to communicate with. In fact, the other party may just like to be quiet; people who like to drink will generally ignore people who do not drink because of their own habits.

105

The same is true when disciples look at their masters, and they will unconsciously be affected by their own habits.

But because of the existence of ego, you will think that your thoughts are always correct, and you will not realize that what you see is only superficial.

Therefore, one cannot judge that a guru has some kind of flaw or defect based on what he sees on the surface.

The flaws of the guru are actually merits. On the other hand, the flaws and flaws shown by the guru are actually the embodiment of merits.
The Dharma body of a Buddha can only be seen by a Buddha and a Buddha, not even a Bodhisattva of the highest rank.

Even the dignified and dignified incarnation of the Buddha, that is, the body of the Buddha, can only be seen by ordinary people who are clean of karmic obstacles.

In Daojidi Ganluzang, it says:

Even before the hurdles of evil karma are removed, even though countless Buddhas come in person, apart from the appearances that you see now, there is no reason to get the good body of seeing appearances.

That is to say, for ordinary beings whose bad karma has not yet been purified, even if countless Buddhas come in person, they can only see the appearance presented by their own karma, and they cannot see the good and solemn appearance of the Buddha. so.

106

Not only that, even a teacher who seems to be an ordinary person cannot meet him if he does not have certain blessings, let alone hear his sermons.

Therefore, we must understand that the shortcomings and defects shown by the guru are for the benefit of sentient beings, not because they are really flawed, but only for the sake of matching the karma of sentient beings.

Master Yeshi Jianshen said: 

The guru was originally a Buddha and Bodhisattva, and he was able to heal his flaws. In fact, it was because of the guru's merits and virtues that he could not heal his flaws without the corresponding merits.

For example, in order to save sentient beings in a certain place, it is necessary to show signs of disability in order to attract everyone's attention.

Ordinary people may need to actually hurt their own bodies if they want to show their disability, such as breaking their arms, etc. But Buddhas and Bodhisattvas want to show their disability, and they can show it at any time without breaking their arms. This is the inherent merit of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas. ability.

Zhangjia Living Buddha, the national teacher of Emperor Qianlong, was a highly accomplished master of the Gelug Sect. He practiced at a very high level and acquired many magical abilities.

However, such a virtuous master has very few disciples.

In his later years, Zhangjia Rinpoche had problems with his eyes. When he showed such defects, it corresponded to the blessings of all beings. Since then, countless disciples in Han, Tibet and Mongolia have converted to Zhangjia Rinpoche.

107

All of these show that when the disciple's blessings are not enough, the master must show some flawed appearances to create opportunities for the disciple. Otherwise, the disciple may not have the chance to listen to the master's sermons or even meet the master.

Blessings are really important. I have taught San Shi Dao all these years, such a precious and rare method, but very few people have the chance to hear it. Only those disciples who have practiced for a long time and accumulated blessings for a long time can have it. opportunity to hear.

Those who are just starting out or those who have not enough good fortune will not hear about Sanshidao.

Focusing on the sinful karma of finding the flaws of the guru, we now understand that the flaws manifested by the guru are for the benefit of all sentient beings;
Therefore, one cannot look for or focus on the flaws of the guru.

At the same time, the sin of paying attention to or seeking out the flaws of the guru is very serious.

The Sequel says:

Seeing the good results in success, seeing the Dharmault destroys the achievement.

108

It means that if you pay attention to the merits of the guru and develop respect, you will also be successful in the future.

Conversely, focusing only on the guru's faults and Dharmaults hinders achievement and destroys the original merits.

Master Bodova once said: "Only focusing on the Dharmaults and Dharmaults of the guru will not only lead to the Dharmailure of the guru's blessings, but will inspire generations to come when the evil consequences of Dharmailing to meet the guru will lead to vomiting, heartache, and numbness in this life. Madness and other illnesses, or disasters and unlucky things.”

These are all things that need to be paid close attention to and must be kept in check at all times.

(3) Seeing the guru as an ordinary person's sinful karma 

People who are just beginning to learn Buddhism do not understand many aspects.

faith and confidence have not yet been established, and I have no concept of many things. It is easy to regard the guru as an ordinary person like myself. This is understandable, and it can be gradually changed through study and practice.

However, for those who have practiced for many years and even received tantric empowerment, no matter what the reason is, if they still treat their masters as ordinary people, this is actually a serious breach of precepts, and it is also a serious breach of precepts. Without blessings, there will be no progress and no achievement.

When Venerable Atisha first arrived in Tibet, Master Dhondunpa asked the Venerable: 

"There are many practitioners in Tibet, but why are so few attained?"

109

The Venerable replied: 

"No matter how big or small, the achievement of merit is inseparable from the master. You Tibetans treat the master as an ordinary person, how can you achieve success."

(4) The sin of despising the guru 

The Kadampa predecessors said:

Those who do not respect the guru are useless even if they are proficient in the Three Treasures.

There used to be a yogi in India, his guru was just a commoner, but he himself was a Brahmin nobleman, and he was highly accomplished, able to fly in the air.

Once, when he was flying in the air, he saw the master teaching the Dharma below. According to the etiquette, he should stop and pay respects to the master. However, he felt that his identity and achievements had surpassed the master, so he was arrogant and deliberately. Flying through the air above the master's head, he fell to the ground on the spot and lost the ability to fly.

At any time, disciples should not be arrogant and despise their masters because of their background, appearance, knowledge, etc.

Lay disciples should pay more attention not to treat their masters slowly because of their social status, status, wealth and other factors.

Otherwise, not only will you Dharmail to achieve success in this life, but it will also hinder the future life, and there will be endless troubles.

110

(5) Sins that make the guru unhappy 

If the disciple's words and deeds are inappropriate and bring unhappiness to the guru, this is also a sin.

A master with great compassion and virtue is generally not angry or unhappy about his disciple's inappropriate behavior.

And a teacher with insufficient moral ability may get angry and lose his temper when he sees his disciple's bad behavior.

If the master is really angry, the disciple will have a great sin, and the retribution will be heavy.

In the Fifty Verses of the Guru's Dharma, it says:

At any time, without disturbing the mind, if ignorance is violated, you will suffer from purgatory.

That is to say, as a disciple, at no time should the guru be upset or unhappy.

Otherwise, you will suffer in purgatory!

However, a master with virtue will not get angry easily, and has a strong ability to endure humiliation. When a disciple's behavior is inappropriate, such a master will not care, and will seize this opportunity to practice forbearance.

Even if some disciples scold their masters, the masters will not be angry. Therefore, after taking refuge in a master with virtue, the disciples will generally not have this karma.

(6) The sin of misunderstanding the teacher’s words and deeds 111

A guru is a Buddha, so every word and deed of a guru is for the benefit of all sentient beings. If you don’t understand the practice and behavior of your guru for the time being, don’t have bad misunderstandings.

Misunderstanding the teacher's meaning can also lead to sin.

If you are beaten by your guru, you should think that the guru is exorcising evil spirits for us; if you are scolded by your guru, you should think that your guru is reciting the mantra of a wrathful deity and bless us; Thinking of this, it must be that the guru pays more attention to us.

If the guru acts like he hates us, think that it is the guru who is removing karma and obstacles for us.

The Mahasiddha Tsangpa Gyare said:

Whipping is empowerment, from which blessings are obtained, scolding is a fierce curse, removes all demonic obstacles, hates and alienates, loves soothe me, loves me for growth, hates me for encouragement, everything is convenient.

Treat being beaten by a guru as an empowerment, and you will definitely receive blessings.

Being scolded by the master is regarded as a fierce curse, which will definitely exorcise the demons.

It is okay to think that everything the guru does is for our good.

Some actions of the master, such as beating and scolding the disciple, usually have deep meanings.

Moreover, a master with virtue will not easily get angry, beat and scold his disciples.

112

The abbot of Labrang Monastery, Master Jiangyang Xieba, is a great siddhi, a very special kind teacher, who is very compassionate to every disciple.

There is only one disciple. As soon as this disciple comes, he will scold the disciple and even beat him with things. This disciple is always like this every time he sees him, so that everyone agrees that Master treats this disciple too badly. , this behavior continued for several years.

A few years later, Jiangyang Xieba said to this disciple: "I used to beat you and scold you to help you eliminate karma. Now, when a great disaster comes, someone needs to preserve the lineage of the Dharma. I beat and scold you every day. If you can bear it, it shows that you are capable of taking on heavy responsibilities, so I did not choose anyone else, only you, and you will keep the scriptures."

Two hundred years ago, Qinghai was in chaos, many monasteries were destroyed, and almost all Buddhist texts were burned.

Muslims arrest monks when they see monks, but when those Muslims saw this disciple of Jiangyang Xieba, they felt very close and treated him very well, so many scriptures were preserved.

In the past, there was a master at Ta'er Monastery, and a disciple had been ill for several years. This disciple often came to ask Master for blessings.

Once, when this disciple came to ask Master for blessings again, Master beat him with a stick and scolded him while beating: "Every day you say blessing, it is useless to bless you every day."

113

The master was very angry and hit him.

Since then, the disciple's illness has been cured, and the master has removed the demonic obstacles for him in this way.

Once, I saw Master Gazang Qusong beat his attendant. The waiter was a Mongolian. Master Gazang Qusong scolded him and beat him angrily. He cried and left. Then the master returned to the room and secretly smiling.

Therefore, Master Gazang Qusong was not really angry, but pretended to be angry, in order to exorcise this disciple and eliminate his ego.

A master with virtue will not mess around, and everything he does has a certain meaning or a great secret meaning, so we can't distort or misunderstand it at will.

Before Venerable Milareba entered Buddhism, in order to take revenge, he went to Bonbo in Tibetan area to teach the method of cursing.

Curses the relatives who took his property and persecuted his mother and sister after his Dharmather died.

Because of this, many people were killed, and the sin was very heavy.

Later, Venerable Milarepa met Guru Marpa, and when he visited Guru Marpa, he told Guru Marpa that he was very poor and had nothing to offer him, so he offered his body, speech and mind.

Master Marpa said, "Very well, from today onwards, your body belongs to me, and you should do what I tell you to do."

114

For the next nine years, Master Marpa beat and scolded Milareba every day, ordered him to work every day, and asked him to do the work that was unnecessary. Even Master Marpa's wife couldn't stand it anymore. , Seeing Milareba suffer every day, she was about to cry.

When lecturing the sutras, Milareba came to listen to the sutras. As soon as Milareba came, Master Marpa reprimanded him: "What are you doing here? What qualifications do you have to listen to the sutras? You are a traitor!" scolded in front of many people.

The same is true when empowering empowerment. Because the method of empowering empowerment is very precious, sometimes, some people use the wealth they have accumulated for a lifetime to ask for empowerment.

At this time, Master Marpa scolded Milareba: "You are just a poor ghost, what can you use to participate in the empowerment?"

In the end, everyone couldn't stand it anymore, and even Milareba himself had doubts about himself, thinking how good it would be if his life was over, and he had this idea.

Nine years later, one day, Master Marpa held a grand and solemn empowerment ceremony, and many big disciples came. Master Marpa was at the front of the disciples, offering a throne with his own hands, and then said , I'm going to invite Milarepa to sit here today.

Milarepa was very frightened after hearing this, thinking that Master Marpa was playing tricks on him again. When he sat on the throne tremblingly, Master Marpa said solemnly: "Before, I was here to give you Eliminate karma, starting today, you are my real noble person, and I will not scold you again."

Master Marpa often beat and scolded Milarepa in order to eliminate Milarepa's sins.

He said regretfully that if Milarepa can endure ten years of asceticism, he can achieve success in a lifetime without practicing.

But everyone interceded for him, so he only practiced asceticism for nine years. Since his sins were not finished, he would have to go through a long period of ascetic practice before he could achieve it.

Master Yanggongba said:

What you show is all merit, what you say is all teaching, and what you do is all righteous and beneficial.

What the guru does is merit, and what the guru says is teaching.

For the disciple, all the actions of the guru are beneficial to oneself, so there will be no misunderstanding when looking at the actions of the guru.

this is very important!

(7) Treating the Guru's Sins Unequally

 After attending a teacher, the disciple must treat the master as a master with virtue, otherwise, there will be great sins.

Some people have worshipped many gurus successively as their masters, and they have consulted these masters for teachings and received empowerments.

116

But in the end, I just want to get close to those famous and prestigious teachers, or the teachers I like.

In fact, this is the self-generated mind of discrimination and greed. There may be differences in some aspects of the masters themselves. However, from the perspective of disciples, they should all be regarded as Buddhas and Bodhisattvas who came to educate themselves, and should be treated the same. The same respect, the same offering.

If there is discrimination, you should realize your mistake in time.

The scriptures say:

Teach one or four verses, if you don't look at it as a teacher, you will be born in a dog's body for a hundred generations, and then you will have a humble body.

If you don't do this, not only will your wishes in this life be unsatisfactory, but you will also become a dog in the next life. After you have been reincarnated as a dog a hundred times at least, you may become a more difficult person.

Therefore, if you worship a master, the disciple must treat the master equally, and treat the master who has worshipped as a master with all the virtues.

117

The fourth section of the mentality of being close to the guru The mentality of being close to the guru is to treat the guru as a Buddha.

In order to see the teacher as a Buddha, the disciple should always think about the teacher's own merits and the teacher's kindness to him, build confidence and inspire respect.

1. The merits and virtues of reciting the guru and building confidence. 

Although the blessing of the guru can grow the merits of the five realms and ten places, it still depends on whether the disciple's confidence in the guru is deep and firm enough.

If the disciples can believe in the guru the way they view the Buddha, it can greatly increase the depth and breadth of their belief in the guru, and it can also avoid other wrong ideas.

Therefore, it is very important for the disciple to be able to see the teacher as a Buddha and thus to develop confidence in the teacher.

Although the guru is a Buddha, when the disciples first began to learn Buddhism, the blessings were not enough, and they could not see it.

Therefore, it is necessary to understand the infinite transforming power of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas, as well as the uninterrupted vast power of vows to transform sentient beings.

118

(1) The incarnation of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas 

The incarnations of inconceivable Buddhas and Bodhisattvas pervade all times, all places, all the time, and everywhere.

This is because the Dharma bodies of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas are inconceivable, so the wisdom of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas is everywhere, and the wisdom of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas can be transformed into Buddha bodies at will.

The womb and birth of our ordinary people must follow the laws of the world, and the transformation of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas is beyond the laws of the world.

Now, because of heavy karma and insufficient blessings, we cannot see the incarnations of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas for the time being.

When you get the golden bodhicitta, you can see the Buddha's extraordinary incarnation, which is the Buddha's physical body, and you can also hear the sutras preached by the extraordinary incarnation.

After cultivating to see the Bodhisattva in one place, you will begin to see the Buddha's Sambhogakaya and hear the Mahayana of the Sambhogakaya.

When Buddhas and Bodhisattvas save sentient beings, they generally have three kinds of manifestations: responsive conditions, responsive tools, and responsive benefits. In this way, they can attract sentient beings with different external circumstances, internal Dharmaculties, and different interests and needs.

The inconceivable and inconceivable salvation of karma is the manifestation of the karma that Buddhas and Bodhisattvas should save sentient beings.
That is, when saving sentient beings, Buddhas and Bodhisattvas want to appear with the same race, the same kind, and the same causal conditions as the sentient beings to save.

119

Only in this way can all beings be psychologically identified and willing to accept the subduing and transformation of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas.

The founder of Kadampa, Master Chung Dunpa, is an incarnation of Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva, but he looks like a very ordinary person.

Venerable Atisha taught scriptures in Tibet for seventeen years. When he was in Ali, the Venerable said, "I want to go back to India. The weather in Tibet is too cold. There are many disciples in India waiting for me to teach the Dharma."

Master Zhongdunba said: "There are many more sentient beings in Tibet that you need to save than in India. You can go to Lhasa. There is a place called Nie Tang nearby. It is very warm and you can see flowers in winter."

After hearing this, Venerable Atisha said: "If this is the case, go to Lhasa and live in the place you said blooming in winter."

When winter came, Venerable Atisha went to Lhasa.

After arriving in Lhasa, the Venerable asked Master Zhongdunpa: "Where is the place you said blooming in winter? Let's go there."

When they arrived at Nie Tang, they found a very small flower by a small stream. Master Zhong Dunba pointed to the flower and said, "This kind of flower blooms in winter."

Venerable Atisha said: "Alas! It can be said that you are not lying. However, what I want to see is not such a small flower, but a very large flower."

Master Zhongdunba thought for a while, and then said: "Master, you can see the flowers you want to see, you can see them."

Master Chung Dunpa stuck out his tongue, which looked as big as the whole of Tibet, with various thousand-petal lotus blossoms open on it.

120

A master like Chung Dunpa looks like a very ordinary old man. When he was old, he often had a runny nose, but he was really the incarnation of Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva.

When Buddhas and Bodhisattvas save sentient beings, they will transform into animals.

In the past, in order to save birds, Buddha Shakyamuni transformed into a bird.

In the Biography of Zhenwen Dawa, it is recorded that the Buddha turned into a bird in order to save birds, a monkey in order to save a monkey, and a king of hungry ghosts in order to save the living beings from the hungry ghosts.

When Buddhas and Bodhisattvas transform into different sentient beings, they must transform into the same race and the same kind of appearance as sentient beings.

"Baoji Jing·Father and Son Meeting" says:

Sometimes Brahma and Buddha appear, sometimes demons appear,

Benefit all sentient beings, the world is unfathomable,

Women and women stop, also in the way of animals,

No greed, no fear, no fear,

No madness, no madness, no madness,

The appearance of the non-blind and the blind, various manifestations,

Subduing all beings.

Father and son here means master and apprentice.

In Tibetan Buddhism, Dharmather and son are often used to refer to Mahasiddha and his disciples, or teachers and apprentices who have a good relationship of dependence, such as Atisha and his son, which refer to Atisha and Zhongdunpa masters and disciples.

121

This sutra says that Buddhas and Bodhisattvas often show signs that sentient beings can accept to save sentient beings.

The sentence-by-sentence translation is: In order to save sentient beings, Buddhas and Bodhisattvas sometimes appear in the form of Brahma Kings and Dishatians; when saving sentient beings in the demonic way, they will appear as Demon Kings; when Buddhas and Bodhisattvas benefit sentient beings in the world, it is difficult for us ordinary people to measure their words and deeds. .

When they appear female, they behave the same as women; sometimes they also appear in the animal realm; Buddhas and Bodhisattvas have already cut off greed, hatred, and delusion, but in order to let all beings accept them, they will show greed without greed; If there is no ignorance, there will be the appearance of ignorance; if there is no madness, there will be the appearance of madness; if the eye of the Dharma is like a torch, there will be the appearance of blindness, and so on.

The purpose of showing various faults is to correspond to the faculties of sentient beings, so as to help sentient beings to believe and accept them, and to accept and subdue them.

Ordinary people can only accept mortal appearance, that is to say, only the karma of mortal appearance.

Therefore, Buddhas and Bodhisattvas transform into ordinary people, and teachers are Buddhas and Bodhisattvas who transform into ordinary people to save sentient beings.

The degree of responsiveness is incredible. Among the sentient beings of the same race and the same kind, because of different conditions such as ability, wisdom, and blessings, different psychological cognitions will be generated, and finally different root tools will be formed.

122

Responsive transformation means that Buddhas and Bodhisattvas transform all sentient beings into corresponding appearances according to the different root tools of sentient beings.

All living beings have different faculties and different understandings. They will accept different teachings and choose different religions and sects.

Buddhas and Bodhisattvas manifest according to the foundation of sentient beings, and whatever kind of foundation the sentient beings have, Buddhas and Bodhisattvas turn into what kind of masters.

Buddhas and Bodhisattvas have transformed themselves into gods of outsiders in order to save sentient beings from outsiders.

Among the precepts of tantra, there is a precept that one should not slander the gods and hierarchs who are heretical.

There are many kinds of heretics, and it can be said that most of the leaders and gods of heretics are incarnations of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas.

For example, in Hinduism, there are two Mahayana kings, one is the real one, and the other is the embodiment of Buddha and Bodhisattva; the same is true of Brahma, the Catholic Virgin Mary is the incarnation of Guanyin Bodhisattva.

These are the incarnations of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas, especially Avalokitesvara.

Because the sentient beings who accept this type of religion only have the blessing of doing some good deeds, or the fruit of human beings and heaven, but not the blessing of liberation.

Therefore, they can only accept the teachings of the corresponding type of religion, and Buddhas and Bodhisattvas will take the form of the leaders of that type of religion to save them.

Now, there are very few people with the blessing of liberation, and there are many people with ordinary blessings. Buddhas and Bodhisattvas will take the form of incarnations that these people can accept to guide them.

123

We have chosen the most excellent and ultimate Buddhism, and we have converted to the Mahayana in Buddhism, and it is also the most excellent Vajrayana in the Mahayana, and we have learned to practice Tsongkhapa, the most complete and most difficult to meet in the Vajrayana. The teachings of the master.

What is even more rare is that I also meet a master who has mastered this teaching method. While feeling joy and happiness, I must clearly understand that the master is the Buddha and Bodhisattva who respond to our kind of people and come to save us.

The inconceivable benefit of conversion refers to the transformation of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas in response to the interests and needs of all beings, manifesting the corresponding signs to save all beings.
For example, the often-mentioned "Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva, who is compassionate and compassionate, and who saves suffering and calamities," will appear immediately when sentient beings encounter disasters, and the allusions of Green Tara, etc., are all good examples.

Now, when we want to learn the Dharma and have the idea of ​​liberating from samsara, we meet the corresponding guru.

Therefore, we must understand that a guru is a Buddha or Bodhisattva who comes to meet our needs and to teach the Dharma.

After understanding this, it is even more necessary to establish confidence in the guru and truly treat the guru as a Buddha or Bodhisattva.

124

(2) The vows of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas are inconceivable. Before each Buddha attains Buddhahood, he will generate Bodhicitta, and he will make a vow. After attaining Buddhahood, he will save sentient beings.

Therefore, after becoming a Buddha, the power of vows will also mature, and the Buddha will definitely return to take advantage of the vows to save sentient beings.

However, due to the heavy karma of sentient beings in the age of the end of the Dharma, the Buddha will not be able to see the manifestation of the Buddha, and the Buddha will take the form of a teacher.

In the "Vajra Account", King Kong Zongzhi said:

Originally a diamond heart, it appears as a teacher, for the benefit of all sentient beings, and turns into an ordinary person.

That is to say, in the future, in the evil world of five turbidities, in order to save all sentient beings, the Vajra Master will incarnate as a teacher, and the above-mentioned teachers will save all sentient beings.

There are many such classics, and the "Second Thoughts Continuation" also says:

In the five hundred years of the end of the Dharma era, I will manifest the teacher's body, recognize it as my body in my heart, and have a heart of admiration for him.

Buddha Shakyamuni once said the same thing. The sutras said: When the Buddha was about to pass away, he saw Yi Bodhisattva and asked Shakyamuni Buddha, after the Buddha passed away, who would guide the monks and how the sentient beings in the Saha world should be saved? Buddha Shakyamuni replied:

125

Jianyi, listen to me, in that future life, I will appear as a teacher, and I will transform into a teacher.

This is what Shakyamuni Buddha himself promised.

Therefore, we can conclude that the guru is the Buddha.

Praying and visualizing the guru with this belief is the foundation of eliminating karmic obstacles, accumulating blessings, and becoming a Buddha after liberation.

Vajrapani Bodhisattva and other four deities, in order to save sentient beings, often take the form of ready-made masters. These masters seem to be ordinary people, ordinary people.

Therefore, some people have many teachers, and one of them must be the incarnation of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas; some people have only one teacher, so this teacher must be the incarnation of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas.

When our karma is very heavy, when we look at the guru, we will feel that it is very ordinary, and even see that the guru has many shortcomings and Dharmaults; when half of the karma has been eliminated, we can see the guru's many merits; when most of the karma has been eliminated, we have truly entered the path. Or when you attain bodhicitta, you see your guru as a bodhisattva; when you reach a bodhisattva in the eighth ground, you see your guru as the incarnation of a Buddha or deity; when you reach a tenth-level bodhisattva, you see your guru as the Buddha’s sambhogakaya.

Therefore, we should now consider our root guru, as well as all lineage masters, to be all Buddhas and Bodhisattvas.

(3) The virtues of reciting teachers build confidence 126

Now that we have understood that the guru is the incarnation of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas, let’s think about the merits and virtues of the guru from all aspects: The guru is proficient in the five great treatises, the four tantras, and the ten great dharmas. Being a monk, etc., these are the merits of the guru, all for the purpose of educating and benefiting sentient beings.

This makes it easy to build up confidence in the guru.

The greater the confidence in the guru, the better, and the greater the confidence, the greater the blessings you will receive.

Confidence in the guru is cultivated to the highest level. Seeing the guru and the Buddha is indistinguishable, seeing the guru and seeing the Buddha, seeing the Buddha and seeing the guru.

At this time, great blessings will naturally be accumulated and many karmic obstacles will be eliminated.

2. Reciting the kindness of the master inspires respect For ordinary disciples, the belief that the guru is a Buddha is not strong enough, and many people do not have a deep understanding of the kindness of the guru.

Therefore, you should always think about the kindness of your guru, which will help you to increase your faith and respect for your guru.

(1) Master En wins Buddha 127

Teacher's kindness always surpasses all Buddhas. A teacher is a Buddha, and a teacher is the same as a Buddha, but in terms of kindness, the kindness of a teacher is greater than that of all Buddhas.
In the past innumerable kalpas, countless Buddhas were born, but none of us deserved to meet them.

According to the classic records, in the sage kalpa we are now in, there will be a thousand Buddhas born. Buddha Shakyamuni is the fourth Buddha. Buddha Muni and Buddha Kasyapa) were born to guide and educate sentient beings, but none of us encountered them.

Now, we have met the guru, and the guru also taught us the full circle teaching of liberation and enlightenment, and guided us.

Therefore, although the merits of the master are equal to those of the Buddhas, the kindness of our teachings is greater than that of all the Buddhas.

Master Bodova once said a paragraph, to the effect that: For ordinary practitioners, the appearance of the Buddha is the icing on the cake, but the appearance of the guru is a blessing in disguise, and the kindness of the guru is even greater.

Because in the early stage of learning, you will generally not see the Buddha, let alone accept the teachings of the Buddha.

Only after one has cultivated to a certain level and reached a certain level, can one see the Buddha, and even hear the Buddha speak sutras.

However, at this time, the cultivators have reached a very high level, and even if they cannot see the Buddha, the achievement may be a matter of one day and one day.

But the guru is different. The guru usually pulls the disciples back from the brink of the three evil realms when the disciples are just learning Buddhism, or even before they learn Buddhism, saves their Dharmakaya's wisdom and life, and leads them to liberation.

Therefore, for ordinary practitioners, the kindness of the guru is greater.

128

Master Kedrub Je said in "Ode to the Three Realms of Auspiciousness":

The only eyes of sentient beings in the three realms, the supreme parents for seeking liberation, the great compassion surpassing all Buddhas, the unparalleled master invites you.

When we can't meet or see other Buddhas and Bodhisattvas, only the guru can teach us the Dharma, teach us the Dharma, and guide us. Therefore, the guru's kindness to us surpasses that of the Buddha.

Shien is even better than Sakyamuni Buddha's Buddhist scriptures say that during the calamity period of the sage kalpa, in the Saha world, there was a wheel-turning holy king who ruled the four continents. The minister is called Hai Chen.
When they aroused bodhicitta before the Treasure Treasure Tathagata, the Treasure Treasure Tathagata prophesied that they would become Buddhas in virtuous kalpas, and after they became Buddhas, they would receive their respective realms.

At this time, everyone chooses the period that is easy to control or the pure land. In the end, there are two periods of life spanning 100 years and 80,000 years old. No one dares to choose these two periods, because they have observed that the life span is 100 years old. When I was in a period of conflict, it was difficult for all sentient beings to subdue them, so they were afraid and gave up.

129

Finally, Minister Hai Chen decided to subdue all sentient beings during the century of human life after becoming a Buddha.

The wheel-turning holy king Fu Wang was the later Amitabha Buddha, his thousand sons were the later Xian Kalpa Thousand Buddhas, and the minister Hai Chen was Shakyamuni Buddha.

Therefore, to us living beings in the age of one hundred years of life, Shakyamuni is more gracious than other Buddhas.

However, even so, we still have no good fortune to meet the Buddha, and we can only rely on the teacher to subdue us, so the teacher's kindness is even more important.

It is also stated in the Treatise on Entering the Bodhisattva:

To benefit all sentient beings, countless Buddhas have passed away, but because of my own Dharmaults, I have not been taught by them.

After the Buddha passed away, many masters and great siddhas appeared in India and Tibet.

In the post-Hong Kong period of Tibetan Buddhism, there have been many incomparable and extraordinary figures such as the Five Sakya Patriarchs, Master Marpa, Venerable Milarepa, Venerable Atisha, Dhondunpa, and Master Tsongkhapa. Dade.

However, due to our own karma, we were not able to receive the guidance of these masters due to the location and time of rebirth.

Only the present masters never leave us and teach us to renounce suffering and attain happiness.

Therefore, for us, the teacher's kindness is especially important.

130

(2) The grace of the teaching Guru's kindness is Dharmar more than the above.

Venerable Atisha, in order to hear the teaching of the order of the Tao, disregarded the danger of storms and other dangers, and drifted in the sea for thirteen months before he saw Master Jinzhou; Master Marpa, Venerable Milareba and other patriarchs, He went through hardships to seek the law.

The road to India used to be very difficult, but the translators still went to India desperately to seek the Dharma.

According to the biography, later, when they recalled the hardships and dangers of the road, they often trembled with fear.

Now, we do not need to suffer a little bit to seek the Dharma, and the master has taught us the complete Dharma.

In "Ganlu Zang" it says:

Even after the same verse for several kalpas, it will be difficult to make offerings to repay the teacher's kindness.

It is also said in the Diamond Sutra that the merit of explaining one or four verses of the Dharma to others is greater than the merit of filling the three thousand great thousand worlds with seven treasures. The Perfection teaching was passed on to us.

It also teaches us to repent of bad karma, increase the blessings, and gain happiness.

For such a great kindness, we should always think about it and feel grateful. Who else has greater kindness than a teacher!

131

(3) The grace of continuous blessing All the progress of our practice comes from the blessing of the guru.

When we practice guru yoga, we want to achieve rapid achievement through the blessing of the guru.

Now, we have the opportunity to receive the empowerment, and the one who gave the empowerment and planted the seeds of liberation for us is the vajra master.

If you don't get the tantra empowerment, you won't even be able to read books on tantra. It's the guru who let us see the dawn of liberation in the samsara of our lives.

(4) The kindness of reciting the master inspires devotion to Venerable Atisha and said, "All my merits belong to the master."

The meaning of this sentence is: all merits are born only by the grace of the guru.

The human body, happiness, happiness, wealth, etc. that we have gained in this life, although it seems that all these are the blessings of our previous life to uphold the ten good precepts and practice generosity, in fact, getting such blessings is also the grace of the teacher's teaching.

Therefore, all our happiness comes from the guru.

132

In all aspects, big and small, we often think about the kindness of the guru: I didn’t know how to learn Buddhism and do good deeds before, but the guru taught us to enter the Buddhist gate.

I didn't know taking refuge before, but the guru led us to take refuge in the Three Jewels and saved us from falling into the evil realm. This is the kindness of the guru.

I didn't know what was bad karma and what was good karma before; which is good fortune and which is karma, but now I can distinguish it clearly. This is the kindness of the guru.

I didn't understand Buddhism before, but now I have made progress every day and opened up wisdom. This is the kindness of the guru.

We couldn't recite "Om Mani Pami Hum" before, but the master taught us to recite it. This is the kindness of the master.

In the past, I couldn't be a human being, and I lost my temper every day. After listening to the teacher's teaching, I don't lose my temper now. This is the kindness of the teacher.

I used to be very greedy, but now I'm less greedy. This is the kindness of the guru.

I didn't even know how to bow before, but the guru taught us. This is the kindness of the guru.

Guru's kindness and parents' kindness are the greatest kindness.

The kindness of parents is the kindness of nurturing, and the kindness of the guru is the kindness of teaching Dharma, the kindness of opening up wisdom, the kindness of nourishing blessings, and the kindness of breaking samsara.

Think about all aspects, how much progress you have made than before, all from the kindness of your guru.

133

134

Section 5 How to learn to be close to the guru We now understand why we are talking about being close to the guru. We also understand the merits of being close to the guru, as well as the various disadvantages of being disrespectful to the guru. Next, we need to learn how to meditate. Get close to the guru.

1. How to practice during the right practice. The part of the right practice is divided into the front line, the right line, and the end line.

Preliminary practice, also known as additional practice, is the preparatory work before the right practice begins, and it is the reason why the experience of right practice can arise smoothly in the mind.

(1) Moving forward is divided into five steps.

Sweeping the Dojo and setting up Buddha statues (1) Sweeping and cleaning the Dojo is the practice of Venerable Atisha’s guru, Master Jinzhou. The purpose is to invite our master to the Dojo through visualization later , Buddha and Bodhisattva to express respect, there is great merit.
135

According to the "Louge Sutra", there are five kinds of merits in cleaning the dojo:

1) Clean your mind. Get rid of the defilements in your heart, and you will be happy.

2) His heart is pure. Remove the defilements in the hearts of all sentient beings who come to this dojo, and make them happy.

3) The Dharma protectors are often protected. Heavenly dragon protectors like to be clean, and they like to protect them even more.

4) Delightful. The body of the sweeper will be healthy and beautiful, and the discipline will be pure.

5) Born in the land of Buddha. After death, you will be reborn in the Pure Land.

When cleaning the dojo, if the intention is to become a Buddha and save sentient beings, in order to make the guru Three Jewels happy, there will be greater merit, and the intention is very important.

Among the disciples of the Buddha, Zhou Lipan Tuojia attained the fruit of Arahantship from the Yisasao Taoist Temple.

When Venerable Ananda first became a monk, he was greedy for a small Dharmamily and could not practice peacefully. The Buddha also asked him to clean the jungle and gradually get rid of the obstacles of greed.

136

(2) Before the Buddha statues were displayed, the teachers of the Kadam School often wore the Buddha statue of Sakyamuni Buddha with them. belief.

Now, temples and Buddhist halls have generally installed Buddha statues, so there is no need to rearrange them.

For Buddha statues, many people may always think: "I am very Dharmamiliar with those Buddha statues, and there is nothing to see."

In fact, if every time you look at a Buddha statue, if you look at the Buddha statue as the real body of a Buddha and Bodhisattva with respect, you will continue to produce extraordinary and other fruits in your heart, and you will gradually see the image as real. Buddha and Bodhisattva.

In addition, the clay statues and bronze statues that we see now, when we cultivate to the Dharma Flow Samadhi of the Mahayana Accumulation Path, we will see that these are like the truly extraordinary incarnations of the Buddha.

At this time, we can still remember the sutras and teachings passed down to us by our previous masters that we have forgotten, and we will not forget them again; when we attain the position of Bodhisattva in the first realm, we will see that the Buddha statue is the true Buddha’s perfect Sambhogakaya.

Therefore, it is extremely important to think of Buddha statues as the true bodies of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas.

Display offerings without flattery 137
After setting up the Buddha statue, it is time to make offerings. At this time, you should pay attention and make offerings to the Buddhas and Tathagatas without flattery.

Flattery is flattery, a flattering and flattering mentality for the purpose of deception.

Flattery is divided into two aspects: flattery of offerings and flattery of motivation.

Flattery of offerings: For lay people, it refers to offerings obtained by stealing, killing, cheating, or other means, or offerings purchased with improper means to make money. Such offerings cannot be used to make offerings to Buddhas and Bodhisattvas.

Motivational flattery is intentional flattery, and intentional mischief is intentional.

The intention is not to make offerings to save sentient beings, liberate and become Buddhas, but to gain Dharmame and Dharmame.

In addition, when lay people make offerings, they are generally for the benefit of this life, happiness, etc., and their intentions are relatively small, and the merits and blessings obtained will be small. These are all things that should be paid attention to.

After sitting uprightly, taking refuge and making offerings to the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas, it is time to sit down to practice and make offerings.
(1) Sit upright on a comfortable cushion, with the back high and the front low, sitting in the eight-support method of Pilu.

138

If you can't do the Vairocana Eight-Support Method, you can sit in a sitting posture that you feel comfortable with, and prepare to practice the four refuges, the bodhicitta, and the four immeasurable hearts.

(2) Refuge Before starting to practice taking refuge, you must first visualize the grain field.

1) Visualize the field of seed and seed. The field of seed is also called the field of blessing, and there are five or six different fields of blessing.

Ordinary people, if we don’t have such a strong ability to visualize, just visualize the guru and Buddha Shakyamuni as indistinguishable, or visualize the guru and the Buddhas as indistinguishable.

Then, practice taking refuge and making offerings to the seven branches.

If you are more wise and capable, you can visualize the Futian in "The Tao of Peace and Happiness": in the void in front of you, tens of meters away and directly between your eyebrows, visualize a lotus throne held high by eight white lions. The superior visualization and his own root guru are indistinguishable from Shakyamuni Buddha. Dharmacing himself, he holds the bowl in his left hand to form a seal, and his right hand forms a seal on the ground; the Buddha's mind visualizes the Vajra Master, and the Vajra Master holds the mind. Think of a blue Sanskrit hum () character.

This kind of Shakyamuni Buddha visualized is called Nengren Vajra General Holder.

139

Before Shakyamuni Buddha, Dharmacing yourself, visualize your root guru; around the root guru, visualize the guru with whom you have a dharma connection; around the masters, visualize the deity, and others Buddhas, Bodhisattvas, warriors, brave mothers, Dharma protectors and other wisdom deities.

In front of the Dharma thrones of all the deities, there are teachings of their own, which appear in the form of scriptures that emit light. Visualize the Buddhas, Bodhisattvas and teachers looking at them with joy.

If the visualization ability is stronger, you can visualize the grain field in detail in the following way:

Above the head of Nengren Vajradhara, visualize the lineage gurus of the practice and blessings group headed by Vajradhara, such as the great yogis such as Venerable Lahoula and Venerable Levwa.

The right shoulder of Nengren Vajradhara is shining, and on the light, he visualizes Maitreya Bodhisattva, the surroundings of Maitreya Bodhisattva, and visualizes the lineage masters of the Guangxing School, such as Bodhisattva Asanga, Bodhisattva of Worldly Relatives, Bodhisattva of Liberation Army, etc.

On the left shoulder of Nengren Vajra General Holder, there is light on the light to visualize Manjusri Bodhisattva, around Manjusri Bodhisattva, and visualize the lineage masters of the Deep View School, such as Nagarjuna, Moon Bodhisattva, Dazheng Li Rhododendron, and Venerable Atisha. Wait.

Our gurus include root gurus, as well as lineage gurus from the Guangxing School, the Deep View School, and the Practice and Blessing School.

In front of Nengren Vajra Master, there is the surrounding of the Dharma-connected guru, and visualize the four deities.

140

The first is the deity of Supreme Yoga, such as the Five Vajras: Victory Vajra, Kashgar, Hevajra, Kalachakra, and Mahavira.

The outer periphery of the Deity of Supreme Yoga, visualize the Deity of Yoga.

For example, the Great Sun Tathagata, etc., there are many deities in the yoga department.

On the periphery of the deity of the yoga department, visualize the deity of the practice department, including Vairocana Bodhi Buddha and so on.

On the periphery of the Xingbu Deity, visualize the Shibu Deity, such as the Twenty-One Mother, Manjushri, Guanyin Bodhisattva, the Eight Great Bodhisattvas, and the Five-Nature God of Wealth are all the Shibu Deity.

On the periphery of the deity of Shibu, visualize all the Buddhas and Tathagatas, mainly thousands of Buddhas and thirty-five Buddhas; on the periphery of the Buddhas and Tathagatas, visualize all the bodhisattvas; on the periphery of the bodhisattvas, visualize the Arhats, including the Arhats and Shravakas. Arhats, Yuanjue Arhats have a little protruding top bun on their heads, but Shravakayars do not; around Arahants, visualize the Dharma protectors, including the four-faced Mahakala, the six-armed Mahakala, the four-armed Mahakala, Two-armed Mahakala, Auspicious Heavenly Mother, Heavenly King of Wealth, etc.; Outside the Dharma Protector, the four heavenly kings are visualized in the four directions under the lotus throne.

After visualizing the field of good fortune, visualize the minds of Nengren Vajrapani and all the Buddhas and Tathagatas, emitting immeasurable white light, welcoming all the gurus, the four deities, all the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas, etc., and the gurus, Buddhas, Bodhisattvas, etc. In the body of the deity's Dharma protectors, the two are indistinguishable.

141

This is the case with the fields of blessing in "The Way of Peace and Happiness". When we cultivate the order of the path, it is the most extraordinary to be able to visualize in this way.

If it is difficult to visualize in this way, you can sit on the lotus throne and visualize Tsongkhapa who is indistinguishable from your own root guru. Tsongkhapa is surrounded by four deities, and then visualize the innumerable Buddhas and Bodhisattvas merging into the sect. Master Kaba.

If it is difficult to visualize in this way, visualize on the lotus throne that your root guru and the Buddhas and Tathagatas are indistinguishable.

Visualizing the grain field should be at a moderate height. Too high or too low will cause the risk of falling off and drowsiness. Therefore, the most suitable position is right between our eyebrows.

The distance from us, according to the "On the Path to Enlightenment", is one arrow away, that is, a distance of tens of meters, less than 100 meters.

2) After contemplating the Refuge Field, practice the Four Refugees in the face of the Refuge Field, and recite the Refuge in the Dharma Book.

3) After devotional practice of taking refuge, it is necessary to cultivate devotional mind.

In order to save sentient beings, we need to generate bodhicitta and the four immeasurable minds, and recite the text on sending hearts in the Dharma book.

142

Teachers' Grain Fields Upper Teachers' Grain Fields

The seven branches of offerings, after offering the mandra to visualize the blessing field, the seven branches of offerings are to be made.
The seven branches of the seven-factor offering are bowing, offering, repenting, rejoicing, turning the wheel of law, asking the Buddha to live in the world, and devotion. These seven parts are called the seven-factor offering.

The seven branches of offerings are from the "Huayan Sutra • Samantabhadra Bodhisattva's Vows". The long part of the Samantabhadra's Vows is very detailed about the Ten Great Vows of Samantabhadra. You can look at them, including the Seven offerings.

The offering of the seven branches is a very important practice method. Not only ordinary people, but also great bodhisattvas often practice the offering of the seven branches.

For example, when the bodhisattvas in the Pure Land of the Medicine Buddha in the East go to the Western Paradise of Ultimate Bliss, once they arrive in the Western Paradise of Ultimate Bliss, what the bodhisattvas do is to make offerings of the seven branches: first, bow down and make offerings to Amitabha, and then rejoice with the merits of the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas in the Paradise of Ultimate Bliss. Repent in front of the Bodhisattva, and then ask Amitabha to preach the scriptures and preach the Dharma, and ask Amitabha to live forever in the world, and finally repay the blessing.

When we meet our guru, we also have to make offerings of the seven limbs.

First bow to the guru; make offerings to one’s body, speech, and mind; repent of bad karma; rejoice in the guru’s merits; ask the guru to teach the sutras and teach the Dharma; pray for the guru to live in the world forever;

That's why the seven branch offerings are very important.

In addition, the purpose of making offerings to the seven branches here is to accumulate funds and remove obstacles, which is of great help to clearly visualize the field of resources.

144

(1) In all the worlds of the ten directions, all the people of the three worlds, teachers and children, with my pure body, speech, and mind, all the pervasive rituals are exhausted.

Promise refers to the prostration of body, speech and mind.

The first is the general gift.

Dharmacing the grain field, with the most sincere heart, with all the pure body, speech, and mind, bow down to all the Buddhas, Tathagatas and Bodhisattvas in the ten directions and three times.

It also includes the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas in the grain fields.

The ten directions refer to east, south, west, north, southeast, southwest, northeast, northwest, up and down.

III refers to the past, present, and future.

1) The body bows to the divine power of Samantabhadra, and before all Tathagatas appear, he reappears in the body of the dust, and bows to the Buddha one by one.

First of all, you must have confidence in Samantabhadra Bodhisattva's vast deeds and vows. On this basis, you must recite all the Buddhas in the ten directions and three times in your heart, as shown in the grain field, right in front of you.

Then visualize yourself transforming into a body equal to the number of dust particles in the buddha-fields, and bowing down in front of the buddhas one by one.

145

There are many kinds of body bowing, including body bowing in Theravada, body bowing in Mahayana Buddhism, and body bowing in Tantra.

These salutes are based on the classics, and they can eliminate karmic obstacles and accumulate blessings.

The most complete obeisance in Mahayana Buddhism is the prostration.

Bend the thumbs of both hands to the palms, and put the palms together in a hollow shape, which looks like a wish-fulfilling treasure.

First of all, put your palms together on the top of your head to "promise your guru", which has three functions: you can be reborn in a pure land; you can eliminate the karma that goes against your guru; and you can get the guru's blessing.

Secondly, putting the palms together on the forehead to "promise to the Buddha" also has three functions: it can eliminate the karma of not respecting the Buddha and Buddha statues; get the blessings of the Buddhas and Tathagatas; eliminate the karma created by the body, such as killing, stealing, sexual immorality, etc.

Thirdly, putting the palms together to "promise to the Dharma" also has three functions: it can eliminate the karma of slandering the Dharma; get the blessing of the Dharma;

Finally, putting the palms together in the heart to "promise to the Sangha" also has three functions: to eliminate the karma of disrespecting the Sangha's treasure.

Bodhisattva is the holy Sangha; Arahants and transcendent Dharma protectors belong to the Sangha; get the blessings of Sangha, get the blessings of Bodhisattvas, Arahants, and transcendent Dharma protectors; eliminate the karma of the mind, which is the karma generated by the mind, such as greed , anger, clinging to wrong views, etc.

146

Then open the palm of the hand, stretch the arm forward, and visualize the wish-fulfilling jewels in the palm of the hand becoming innumerable, making offerings to the Buddhas, Tathagatas, and Guru Three Jewels.

Next, throw the whole body on the ground, spread out the body, and pay homage to the Three Jewels of the Guru.

It is said in the scriptures that after worshiping like this, future generations will obtain the blessing of the throne of the wheel-turning throne a thousand times the number of dust particles on the ground pressed by the body.

Therefore, some masters say that if you know that the prostration has these qualities, you will wish your body to be taller and your hands and feet to be longer.

Because the Three Jewels of the Guru are the most profound and perfect field of blessings, whatever karma you do will bear the fruit, and you will feel the good fruit of being respected by others, and you will be respected by others from generation to generation.

Many people are not respected in society, and their words and actions are not taken seriously; or they are not respected at home, they are contradicted by children, etc., the prostration will soon change.

Prostration can also combat arrogance, and prostration is also a method of whole-body exercise, which can cure many serious diseases.

2) The intention is to pay homage to as many Buddhas as dust in a single dust, in the assembly of Bodhisattvas in various places, and the dust of the endless Dharma realm is also the same, and I deeply believe that all Buddhas are filled.

First contemplate the various merits and virtues of the Buddhas and Tathagatas in the heart, and praise and rejoice;

147

Then imagine that in every particle of dust, there are all the Buddhas of all the number of dusts, preaching sutras and teachings in the assembly of Bodhisattvas, and convinced that this is the case in the endless dharma realms of the ten directions, and every particle of dust fills all Buddha Tathagata.

Or imagine that in every mote of dust in our southern Zhanbu continent, there are all Buddhas and Bodhisattvas in the grain field filling the void, and at the same time arousing great reverence, devotion, and joy to the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas. This is the intention to bow.

When bowing with your mind, you should visualize many Buddhas and Bodhisattvas in your heart, especially you must be able to visualize your root guru clearly, and you must have great pure confidence and joy in your guru.

Then, we must also consider the merits of the body, speech, and mind of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas, and the merits of the teacher's body, speech, and mind.

The more you think about it, the more your faith and desire will increase, and your heart will become more pure. This is also a kind of salute.

3) The speech bows and bows each with a sea of ​​sounds and sounds, and there are endless wonderful sounds and words, which will be used in all future kalpas, and praise the Buddha's deep sea of ​​merits and virtues.

Visualize that there are innumerable pores on your body, each pore has innumerable heads, each head has innumerable mouths, and each mouth is reciting the praises of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas.

In this way, there are infinite sounds

148

Praise the endless merits of all Buddhas and Bodhisattvas in the ten directions and three times, including the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas in the grain field.

Such a compliment is very special.

(2) The most wonderful flower garlands, music and music, incense sticks, and umbrella covers, and the most magnificent ornaments, I make offerings to the Tathagata.

The best clothes are the best incense, the last incense, the burning incense, and the candles are all like a wonderful gathering. I will make offerings to the Tathagata.

The second branch is the offering branch. There are two types of offerings here: the superior offering and the supreme offering.

These two verses are about offering offerings, which are offerings made with worldly offerings.

There are ten offerings here:

Miaohua is a strange flower that can only be found in the heavens.
The flower wand is connected by various wonderful flowers.
Tones are the sounds made by all kinds of wonderful musical instruments.
Incense mud made of various wonderful fragrances.
The most wonderful and solemn among the umbrellas.
The most beautiful of clothes.
The most beautiful fragrance is the perfume that fills the three thousand great thousand worlds.
The incense powder made of various wonderful incense can be burned and can also be used as a mandala.
Burning Incense A single or synthetic spice that emits an aroma when burned.
Lamps Various scented oil lamps, or jewelry that emits light, etc. "Miaogao gathers", Miaogao refers to Miaogao Mountain, which is Mount Sumeru.
Visualize using these ten most extraordinary offerings, piled up one by one to be as high as Mount Sumeru, and make offerings to the Buddhas and Tathagatas.

There are many ways to make offerings, there are two common ones, offering offerings in person and visual offerings.

For example, if you want to make offerings to flowers, you should offer flowers yourself; while offering flowers, visualize countless flowers and make offerings to Buddhas and Bodhisattvas.

It is also necessary to recite the offering text, the simple offering text is "Om ah hum, om ah hum, om ah hum, make offerings to the three jewels of the guru".

"Om ah hum" represents the body, speech and mind of the Buddhas and Tathagatas.

The first time "Om Ah Hum", the blessing offering changed from impure to pure; the second time, the blessing offering became nectar-like body, the flower became nectar-like flower, the water became nectar-like water, and the nectar-like nature The physical nature is to be able to exorcise demons, cure diseases, live a long life, etc. The third time, the blessing offerings become countless.

The common merit of making offerings is to gain wealth.

In addition, each offering also has its own different merits.

For example, water supply, because water is pure, in addition to obtaining wealth, water supply can also purify the mind; offering lamps, because the lamps are bright, so offering lamps can open up wisdom; offering flowers, they will look solemn and beautiful; offering offerings to various If you plant fruits and other food, you will have no shortage of food for life; if you make offerings to houses, such as building a temple, or building a house for your guru, the merit is to be reborn in the pure land; if you offer an umbrella, you will not have troubles; if you offer a throne, you will be promoted. ; If you make offerings to the wish-fulfilling treasures, you will have wishful thinking; if you make offerings to the jeweled banners, you will gain prestige.

150

Different offerings have their own merits.

If you have these offerings yourself, make offerings yourself.

If not, you can make offerings through mental visualization.

Visualize the blessings that you have accumulated in your lifetimes, which have become various offerings, and become countless incense, flowers, water, lamps, as well as spices, fruits, musical sounds, etc., arranged in a solemn arrangement to make offerings to Buddhas and Bodhisattvas.

Since the above are offerings made with worldly offerings, they are called superior offerings and superior offerings.

Then there is the supreme offering.

With a vast understanding of mind, I deeply believe in all the Buddhas of the three times, and with the power of Samantabhadra's actions and vows, I generally make offerings to the Tathagata.

The supreme offering is the offering of the saints.

For example, sages or bodhisattvas make offerings from things beyond the world such as wish-fulfilling trees and nectars, as well as offerings made by great bodhisattvas with the power of supernatural powers.

151

The supreme offering that we ordinary people can make is to make offerings to Buddhas and Bodhisattvas with various "vast and enlightened minds".

Including the bodhicitta of saving sentient beings from samsara; and the mind of turning all the good roots into offerings to the Buddhas with the power of faith and vows to the Buddhas like diamonds, and so on, and then through the blessing of the great vows of Samantabhadra Bodhisattva, Make offerings to the Buddhas and Tathagatas in the way of Samantabhadra.

Samantabhadra Cloud Offering is: First, visualize yourself transformed into Samantabhadra Bodhisattva, sitting on a white elephant with six tusks, holding a wish-fulfilling jewel in his hand, and then visualize the wish-fulfilling jewel emitting twenty-five rays of light, and there is another one in each rays of light. Samantabhadra Bodhisattva, the wish-fulfilling jewel of each Samantabhadra emits twenty-five rays of light, and there is Samantabhadra in the light.

Continue to contemplate in this way until the entire sky is filled with Samantabhadra.

Then visualize the wish-fulfilling treasures in the hands of each Samantabhadra Bodhisattva transforming into various offerings, offering offerings to the Buddhas and Tathagatas, and at the same time reciting the offering Yun Dharani mantra:

Om Namo Bhagavadi Bhazasa Rezamadani Datakada Arehadi three have three Buddah, Dah, Taomba, a thief, a thief, a thief, a thief, a thief, a thief. Ba thief Maha Bodi word Daba thief Maha Bodi sect master Wa Sanmeng Zamana Ba thief Sajawagerma Awa Rena Buhu Danapa thief Suha

After reciting this mantra three times, if you make offerings to a flower, the flower will appear innumerable rains of flowers on the pure land of every Buddha and Bodhisattva; if you offer a cup of tea, a cup of tea will appear in front of every Buddha and Bodhisattva. This is the power to realize the power of Puxian cloud offering.

(3) The evil deeds that I have done in the past are all born from the beginningless greed, hatred, and delusion, and from the body, speech, and mind. I now repent of everything.

Whether it is a Buddhist or a non-Buddhist, our body, speech, and mind have created a lot of karma from generation to generation due to greed, hatred, and delusion.

The result of karma is suffering and falling into the evil realm. Therefore, it is very important to eliminate karma through repentance. This is the factor of repentance.

There are many kinds of karmic obstacles, among which the karma of breaking the precepts is particularly large. For example, if you break the precepts after taking the five precepts, you will have a great sin.

Therefore, before we take the five precepts, we must first consider whether we can achieve the purity of the precepts. If not, we can temporarily waive the five precepts, or we can take one or two precepts first.

There are also people who break the Bodhisattva precepts after taking the bodhisattva precepts. They will also have serious sins. These karmic obstacles need to be repented to eliminate.

Then, how to repent is to repent in front of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas according to the four powers.

153

When we sincerely take refuge in the guru, the Three Jewels are the power of reliance; reciting the mantras of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas, the four refuges, the hundred-syllable mantra, and the thirty-five Buddhas’ repentance texts are the countermeasures; the regret for karma is the power of abandonment; To do, with such determination, is to be free from evil.

With these four powers, one can repent and eliminate karma.

(4) All sentient beings in the ten directions, with and without learning of the two vehicles, all Tathagatas and Bodhisattvas, all of their merits and virtues are joyous.

The fourth branch is the rejoicing branch, which is the merit of rejoicing.

Rejoice in the merits of the Buddhas and Tathagatas, the merits of Bodhisattvas, and the merits of Arahants; also rejoice in the merits of those who have learned and those who have not learned.

What is learning? Among the five paths and ten places of cultivation, practitioners who are in the path of accumulation, path of practice, path of vision, and path of cultivation are called learning, and those who are liberated are without learning.

Also rejoice in the merits of ordinary people and lay people.

When you are happy, pay attention to sending true joy.

When you rejoice in the merits and virtues of others, if your intentions are the same as those of the person you wish to rejoice in, you can get the same merits and blessings as the other person; if your intentions are bigger, you will get more merits and virtues than the other party; If you have a bad heart, you will not get all the blessings of the other party. It is necessary for Buddhas and Bodhisattvas to have no selfishness in their intentions, and everything they do is for the benefit of all sentient beings.

Look at the heart size.

154

If we rejoice in the merits of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas with such great motivation, we can obtain the blessings of Buddhas.

But our motivation is definitely not that great, and it is impossible to obtain such great merit.

It is also very easy to cultivate the blissful mind, which can be cultivated anytime, anywhere.

You can do it while you are lying down, and you can do it while you are reading.

We sometimes read the biographies of Buddhas, Bodhisattvas and great achievers, such as the biographies of Buddha Shakyamuni. At this time, we should pay attention to two aspects. One is to study Buddha Sakyamuni, and the second is to rejoice in Buddha. merit.

The same is true when reading the biography of Master Tsongkhapa. The first is to learn about Master Tsongkhapa. What books and sutras he has read and read in his life, we should also read and read them. The second is to follow Master Tsongkhapa’s instructions. merit.

In addition, when cultivating with joy, it is easy to find the target of one's heart.

For example, if we want to rejoice in the merits and virtues of monks, just think about the merits of monks in all the temples in the world, including those in Tibetan and Han regions. Such a moment of joy can accumulate a lot of blessings.

Applied to cutting off afflictions, Suixi can counteract jealousy.

155

(5) Please turn the Dharma wheel to support all the world's lamps in the ten directions. Those who first achieved Bodhi, I now urge them all to turn them on the unsurpassed wonderful Dharma wheel.

The fifth branch is asking to turn the Dharmalun. To turn the Dharmalun is to teach the scriptures and spread the Dharma.

When a Bodhisattva first became a Buddha, he would not take the initiative to preach the scriptures and preach the Dharma. Someone needed to ask for the Dharma. If no one asked for the Dharma, the Buddha would pass away and leave the world.

After Buddha Shakyamuni became a Buddha, he did not teach the Dharma for seventy-seven forty-nine days, because no one asked for the Dharma.

Forty-nine days later, Emperor Shitian and Dabra Tianwang went to seek the Dharma, Emperor Shitian offered a conch shell, and Dabra Tianwang offered a golden wheel.

After making offerings and seeking the Dharma, Shakyamuni Buddha began to first turn to the Four Noble Dharma, the second to the Dharma of No Signs, and the third to the Dharma of Righteousness. He taught 84,000 Dharma.

Now, we visualize that the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas in the grain fields are also first-time Buddhas, and we also come to seek the Dharma.

Visualize yourself as the Emperor Shatian or the Great Brahma King, or you can just be yourself, hold a golden wheel or conch shell in your hand, make offerings to the Buddhas, and then ask the Buddhas to teach the sutras and preach the Dharma, and save all sentient beings.

As mentioned earlier, the scriptures say that all Buddhas and Tathagatas will transform into masters to save sentient beings.

In this way, there are countless masters who have manifested as Buddhas and Tathagatas, preaching scriptures and teachings in our southern Zhanbu continent.

156

Seeking the law is very important.

The fourth Panchen Lama lived to be ninety-three years old. A few years before the master passed away, the disciples thought that the master was too old to teach the scriptures every day. Block it back.

After such a period of time, when the Fourth Panchen Lama saw that no one was seeking the Dharma, and that what he had done in the world had been done, he passed away.

Seeking the Dharma can also eliminate the karma of slandering the Dharma.

Seeking the Dharma and teaching the scriptures can save many sentient beings, so seeking the Dharma can also accumulate great blessings.

Once we understand this, we should always seek the Dharma from our master.

(6) If the Buddhas who live in the world want to show Nirvana, I sincerely and sincerely advise you, only wishing to live for a long time for the sake of all sentient beings.

What is it to ask to live in the world? It is to ask Buddhas, Bodhisattvas, and teachers not to pass away, to live in the world forever, and to benefit all sentient beings.

Buddhas and Bodhisattvas are free to come and go, free to come and go, and free to leave the world when they pass away.

Therefore, if someone can ask the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas to live in the world, the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas will not pass away, and they can spend more time benefiting sentient beings.

157

When Dharma King Yongzeng was eighty-five years old, he suddenly fell ill one day. He was so ill that no water could get in, and the doctors could not do anything about it.

At that time, in Qinghai, 80% to 90% of the people who studied Buddhism were disciples of Dharma King Yongzeng, and the disciples went to ask Dharma King to live permanently.

Everyone knelt in front of the Dharma King and couldn't get up. After kneeling like this for more than half an hour, Dharma King Yongzeng said, "Let's all get up, how long do you want me to live?" An old lama who was kneeling at the front said, "One One hundred years old."

His Holiness thought for a while and said, "If you are a hundred years old, ninety-seven or eighteen years old is a hundred years old."

In those years, because of the intercalary month, one hundred years old was actually around ninety-seven or eight years old.

Although the origin was not very good, His Holiness still promised to live to be a hundred years old.

From that day on, His Holiness began to recover, and he was able to teach scriptures again. At the age of ninety, he could teach scriptures for six hours a day.

When he was ninety-seven years old, the Dharma King said that all the sentient beings he was supposed to save had been saved, and that it would be meaningless to stay in the world, so he truly passed away.

If the teachers are ill, some of them are seriously ill, for the benefit of ourselves and all sentient beings, we should ask them to live in the world for a long time.

Maybe if you pray today, you will be fine tomorrow. Many teachers get sick because they cultivated the bodhicitta of self-exchange and absorbed the diseases of sentient beings. Disabled.

In addition, for disciples, if they ask their master to live forever, they will live longer and increase their blessings.

158

In Tibetan areas, there is a ritual asking for permanent residence, and you can practice according to this ritual.

Now, let's make a simple prayer to ask for the world: First, visualize a lotus throne with a crossed vajra, and then visualize that such a throne is offered to every buddha, buddha and bodhisattva in the food field. They all accepted the throne happily; then, visualize yourself in front of the Buddha and Bodhisattva, bowing down respectfully, and asking the Buddha and Bodhisattva to live forever; finally, visualize the Buddha and Bodhisattva on the throne accepting the prayer, agreeing to us, and continuing to live for hundreds of years. For a calamity, it will never even pass away.

(7) All praises and offerings to the devotion branch, asking the Buddha to live in the world to turn the Dharma wheel, repent of all good roots with joy, and dedicate it to sentient beings and the Buddha’s way.

The last is the dedication factor, which is to dedicate all the good roots and merits generated by the six branches of praise, making offerings, rejoicing, repenting, turning the Dharma wheel, and asking to live in the world to all sentient beings. cause.

The merits of practice must be dedicated, and all of them must be dedicated to attaining Buddhahood, and dedicating all sentient beings to get rid of suffering and achieve happiness.

The bigger the motivation, the greater the merit. If you only dedicate it to your parents and children, you will get as much merit as these few people.

159

If you dedicate the six realms to sentient beings, and there are countless sentient beings in the six realms, the blessings will become countless blessings; how much merit is there for sentient beings to get rid of suffering and achieve happiness, so the dedication will have as much merit.

In addition, after doing the devotion, the merit will not be eliminated, otherwise, it will be eliminated as soon as you get angry.

For example, if you get angry with a Bodhisattva, you will eliminate the blessings of a hundred kalpas, or even a thousand kalpas in an instant.

In addition to the blessings of emptiness, the blessings of bowing, making offerings, etc. will all be eliminated, but the devotion will not.

Fortune is like a glass of water, there are many obstacles, for example, someone will pour it out, or it will be dried by the sun, but if you pour this glass of water into the sea, if the sea doesn’t dry, the glass of water will not dry up. It has become forever, so devotion is very important.

After the offering of the mandra is completed, the mandra can be offered for thirty-seven or seven times several times.
Please refer to "The Treasures of the Dharma Sea" 2 for the offering of Mandha.

Heart Prayer Teaching and Heart Unity 160
Then, pray with a sincere heart of faith in the Three Jewels of the Guru and strong faith.

For example: I pray to the guru, the Three Jewels, to bless me to achieve the Three Paths, especially to realize the concept of impermanence in life, to be able to realize the impermanence of life, to generate renunciation, to obtain bodhicitta, etc.

After praying, visualize the Buddhas, Tathagatas, Arhats, and Dharma protectors in the field of sustenance, all turning into light, from the outside to the inside, in turn merged into the body of Nengren Vajradhara.

Then visualize the gurus around the root guru, merging into the body of the root guru, as well as their respective thrones.

Next, visualize the root guru sitting on top of your head, in the same direction as you, Dharmacing the Nengren Vajra Master, and begin to correct your practice.

(2) Zheng Xing According to the above-mentioned "the root of the way is to get close to the master", slowly cultivate and meditate until the belief that "the master is the Buddha" arises in the heart, and it becomes stronger day by day.

After completing the right practice, you must take back the grain field.

Visualize the root guru on your head blending into the heart of Nengren Vajradhara, so that Nengren Vajradhara becomes the guru Nengren Vajradhara.

Continue to visualize, Guru Nengren Vajradhara becomes smaller and smaller, and finally, shrinks to an inch size, descends along the central channel on the top of your head, and then visualizes your heart turning into an eight-petal lotus with a moon wheel flat on the lotus. , Guru Nengren Vajradhara sits upright on the moon wheel, the lotus petals slowly close, and my heart is indistinguishable from that of Guru, Buddha Shakyamuni, and Vajradhara.

161

(3) The end of the line The end of the line is the end of the practice of the right line.

Generally, it is to recite the vows such as "Puxian Xingxiangpin", and then make a big devotion.

2. How to meditate on a daily basis If you have time, you should read more sutras on teaching and relying on the teacher's teachings, or the biography of the patriarch's great virtue and relying on the teacher.

For example, Naropa served as Guru Tilopa, Milarepa served as Guru Marpa, Zhongdunpa served as Master Saizumba, Venerable Atisha, and so on.

These are good examples, and we have to learn from our elders.

In addition, in order to prevent afflictions, obstruct the practice, and protect the root door of daily life, do not see or listen to things that will cause afflictions.

162

Section 6 Disciple's Virtue and Requirements 1. A disciple's Virtue must meet certain requirements to become a guru. To be a disciple, one must also have a disciple's Virtue. A disciple without Virtue will also hinder his study.

The Four Hundred Verses of the Madhyamika say:

The mind is wise and seeking to make progress, this is called the instrument for hearing the Dharma.

That is to say, disciples who hear the Dharma must possess the three virtues of righteousness, wisdom, and seeking to improve.

(1) Righteous Heart The first virtue is righteous heart.

Righteousness of mind means to be mentally normal and not to hold wrong views.

Because even a person with a normal mind will not believe in the righteous Dharma when the blessings are not enough if the mentality is not right and if they hold wrong views.

The other meaning of xinzheng is not to fall into the party category, which is called "right abiding" in the broad theory.

The sects are the sects, that is to say, one must not have any sectarian attachments when studying Buddhism, and only love one’s own sect and look down on other sects. In this way, you will not be able to see the merits and virtues of the good teachers, and you will not be able to comprehend the Dharma and the meaning of the good teachers.

163

(2) Wisdom The second type of virtue is wisdom.

Dharma-hearing disciples must be wise enough to be able to distinguish between good and evil, and to be able to distinguish whether the teaching is a righteous Dharma or an evil Dharma that is similar to a righteous Dharma.

(3) Seeking to make progress The third kind of virtue is seeking to make progress.

As a disciple who listens to the Dharma, one must be diligent, not slack or lazy.

2. The conditions of the disciples require that there are very few teachers who have all the virtues, and it is very, very rare.

There are very few qualified disciples.

Let's think about it, there are seven or eight billion people in the world, of which Buddhists only make up a very small part; and among Buddhists, there are even fewer who have the requirements for discipleship, and those who can hear the extraordinary teaching of Sanshidao Even more rare, I don't know how many lifetimes of blessings I have to accumulate before I have the chance to hear Sanshidao.

164

Therefore, it is rare to find a master and a disciple who meet the requirements, and it is even more rare that the two can meet and teach and learn the correction method.

Therefore, after meeting a rare teacher, as a disciple, you must cherish this extraordinary karma and study hard.

(1) Dharma-hearing disciples should always ask Dharma disciples to frequently ask their masters to teach the scriptures and spread the Dharma.

It is best to ask the master more than three times for each method, and the more times you ask, the better.

The more you seek and ask for the Dharma, the more merit you will accumulate.

Seeking the Dharma can also remove the karma of slandering the Dharma.

The karma of slandering the Dharma is very large, equivalent to the karma of killing an arahant. This is not an ordinary karma. Only by seeking the Dharma can this karma be eliminated.

Seeking the Dharma can also remove the karma of deDharmaming the Dharma.

Asking for the four-sentence method will eliminate the karma of slandering the four-sentence method. If you ask for the three ways and the order of the path, you can eliminate the karma of slandering the 84,000 methods, because the order is the essence of the 84,000 methods. Shidou is the outline of the order.

When Dharma King Yongzeng was alive, he required his disciples to request the Dharma every year.

In summer, the sutras are taught every day, and the disciples ask for the Dharma once a day.

It doesn’t matter if you can’t ask for it. During the festivals, you have to offer Hada to your guru. Asking once at this time is equivalent to asking for all the Dharma for a year, and the merit is very great.

165

(2) Disciples who hear the Dharma should eliminate the Dharmaults of the three types of vessels: the covered vessel, the leaky vessel, and the unclean vessel.

If a disciple who hears the Dharma cannot get rid of the Dharmaults of these three kinds of equipment, it will seriously hinder the generation of the three kinds of wisdom of hearing, thinking, and cultivating.

Decapsulators are utensils with lids, such as cups with lids.
When listening to the Dharma, even if the Dharma door taught by the master is excellent, if you don't listen carefully or listen to it, it is like a cup with a lid on it.

Therefore, when listening to the Dharma, you must concentrate all your attention on listening. If your mind is distracted, it will be the same as not listening to the Dharma.

After listening to it, you cannot forget what you have heard. Think more in your heart: "What did the master say today?"
It must be reviewed repeatedly, otherwise it will be forgotten, just like a vessel with a leak at the bottom, no amount of nectar can be kept.

That is to say, although you listen carefully and your motivation for listening to the Dharma is correct, if you do not review and consolidate the Dharma in time after hearing the Dharma, you will forget the Dharma, and it will not help you in your study and cultivation.

It is very important to express your mind when you hear about the troubles of eliminating unclean devices.
The best motivation is to generate Bodhicitta, to listen to the Dharma in order to save sentient beings, liberate and become a Buddha.

If the intention is not good, it is like pouring nectar into an unclean vessel, and you cannot drink it, and it cannot be applied to study and cultivation.

For example, some people listen to the Dharma in order to see and hear more; some people want to go back and show off and tell others; some people are interested in the stories quoted by the master when he teaches the Dharma; some people even come to listen to the Dharma, just I want to see if the guru is wrong.

These are all incorrect motives. Such motives will ignore the main points of the Dharma at light level, and will lead to wicked attachments, and the further you go on the wicked path, the obstacles will be liberated.

167

3. Hearing the Dharma disciples should have six kinds of thoughts. When a disciple hears the Dharma, he should not only pay attention to eliminating the Dharmaults of the three kinds of devices, but also have six kinds of thoughts, that is, the understanding of the six kinds of mentality.

(1) Treat yourself as a patient who wants to treat yourself as a patient suffering from afflictions and karma.

(2) To be a doctor for the lecturer I want to regard the master who lectures the Dharma as a doctor who can heal one's own afflictions and karma.

(3) Treating the Dharma as a medicine, I want to regard the Dharma taught by the master as a top-grade medicine for curing affliction diseases and karma diseases.

(4) After studying, practicing, healing, and wanting to hear the Dharma, it is like a patient who has received good medicine from a doctor, but if he does not listen to the doctor's advice and take the medicine on time, he will still not be able to cure the disease.

In this case, the Buddha and the guru cannot do anything, and it is useless to teach no matter how advanced the Dharma.

Therefore, after hearing about it, you must follow the teachings, practice and practice diligently, in order to cure afflictions and karma diseases.

(5) Those who regard the Buddha as a sage want to regard the Buddha as a sage with the most perfect merits, wisdom, blessings, and abilities. Only by thinking in this way can they have pure faith in the Dharma.

(6) For a long time in the Dharma, I want to regard the Dharma as the most extraordinary treasure of wisdom, and pray for the Dharma to live forever in the world.

You should think like this: "Master Daen taught me the righteous Dharma of the Buddha, such a precious treasure of wisdom, if it can live in the world for a long time, it will benefit countless sentient beings.

"Then you have to be diligent, make great vows, have bodhicitta, and do your best to make the Dharma abide for a long time.

The above are the six types of thoughts that disciples need to have when they hear the Dharma.

To put it simply, first of all, realize that you are a patient suffering from afflictions, your guru is a doctor who treats the disease, the dharma taught by your guru is the medicine to cure the disease, and practice is to take medicine.

Also think: Not only do you have afflictions and diseases, but all sentient beings have afflictions and diseases. Therefore, you must do your best to tell others about the methods and methods of treating illnesses, so as to benefit yourself and others.

169

4. The etiquette of disciples listening to the Dharma As a teacher, when teaching the Dharma, one should show compassion and impermanence, and should not be arrogant or greedy for Dharmame and fortune.

This is the mentality a teacher needs to have when he teaches the Dharma.

As a disciple, when listening to the Dharma, it is best to also generate Bodhicitta and desire for liberation: I want to become a Buddha and save sentient beings to listen to the teacher's teaching.

If you just think: I want to see if what this master is saying is correct... Wait, if you listen to the Dharma with this mentality, you will have no merit if you listen to it.

It is said in the Vinaya Sutra that there are thirty-six kinds of majesty to hear the Dharma, so I won't talk about that much here, just briefly.

When listening, the master should be in the seat, and the disciple should be under the seat; if the master is standing and teaching the Dharma, the disciple should sit down and listen to the Dharma, it is not the Dharma.

When you hear it, you should take off your shoes and hats, and the patient or special circumstances may not take them off.

When you hear it, you can't bring weapons such as knives.

When listening, do not recite the scriptures or mantras in your mouth, and do not recite them silently, but concentrate on listening.

170

When walking, the master should teach the Dharma in front and the disciples should listen in the back.

If the disciple is listening in the front and the teacher is speaking at the back; or if the teacher is speaking on the side of the road and the disciple is listening in the middle of the road, it is not good for the Dharma.

171

...

Leisure is better than wishful pearls, and encounters are rare only today,

It is rare to be afraid of being lost like empty electricity. This conception of meaning is exhausted.

It is like the skin of empty chaff, day and night to take the heart,

I am always working diligently, and those who are determined to get rid of it should be encouraged!

——"The Ode to the Steps of the Bodhi Path"

172

Chapter 2 How to study after getting close to the guru

The first chapter is full of people

This part talks about the rarity and preciousness of the human being.

The content includes: what is a leisurely human body; the value of a leisurely human body; the conditions for obtaining a leisurely human body; the rarity of a leisurely human body; cherishing a leisurely human body.

Many people have been studying Buddhism for a long time, and they recite sutras and mantras diligently every day. However, they may have never considered a problem, or they may have never realized that it is a problem, which is about their own body, this fleshly body, what does it have? feature, what does it do.

Because we have to rely on this body to practice, to get rid of troubles, to obtain happiness, until liberation and becoming a Buddha.

So, we should know more about our own person.

173

1. What is a human body full of leisure time? To liberate and become a Buddha, one must use the body to practice.

However, everyone's physical conditions are different. For liberation, what kind of human body is the most extraordinary? The most useful and precious thing is to fill the human body with leisure.

A human body full of leisure is a human body that has the eighteen conditions of eight leisure and ten perfection.

(1) The eight flawless human beings have time.

That is to say, those who wish to be liberated must not only respect and believe in the Three Jewels of the Guru, but also have the time and ability to hear, reflect, and cultivate the true Dharma. This is called leisure.

In order to understand the eight flaws, one must first understand the eight flaws.

The eight flaws are the eight obstacles to the practice of Buddhism, four of which are adverse conditions for human beings, and four are adverse conditions for non-human beings.

The adverse conditions of the four kinds of human beings are: to meet the times of no Buddhadharma; to be born in a Buddhadharma-free area or not to believe in the Buddhadharma; to be deaf, dumb, and disabled; to hold wrong views.
174

(1) When there is no Buddhadharma era, if you are born in an era without Buddhadharma, you will not be able to practice Buddhadharma, and it will be useless to reincarnate as a human being.

The era without Dharma is very, very long.

In Buddhism, "Kalpa" is often used as a unit of time.

According to Mahayana, a great kalpa lasts over 12.9 billion years.

Kalpas are divided into two categories: bright and dark. Bright kalpas refer to the kalpas in which the Buddha is born and the light of the Buddha's Dharma exists.

A dark kalpa is a kalpa in which no Buddha is born.

The kalpa in which Buddha Shakyamuni descends is the bright kalpa, and a thousand Buddhas will appear in this kalpa, so it is called the sage kalpa, which means there are many sages.

The birth of a Buddha is very rare, and only one bright kalpa appears in countless dark kalpas.

It is said in the Kusa Lun that in the past there were five bright kalpas, but there were fourteen hundred dark kalpas.

Although there are many Buddhas born in bright kalpas, in so many dark kalpas, there is not even a single Buddha.

If you are reincarnated in a dark kalpa, you will never encounter the Buddha and the Dharma.

Not only that, even in bright kalpas, it is not always possible to encounter the Dharma.

In the early days of the Ming Kalpa, the life span of a human being is very long, almost as long as that of a deity, but at this time no Buddha will be born.

Then the human lifespan gradually decreased to 80,000 years, and only then did the Buddha begin to appear.

A Buddha will not appear before a life span of 80,000 years.

175

The origins of human races are very different.

Tibetans are changed by monkeys, which is recorded in the Tibetan historical book "Records of the King of Tibet".

Some races are transformed from fish, some are transformed from bears, and they are transformed from various animals.

There are also dragons, Yashas, ​​etc. These claims are all recorded in classics.

The race of Buddha Shakyamuni was changed by heaven and man, and it was from heaven and man who came down to the Saha world. When he first came down, his lifespan was very long.

Later, the Shakya people gradually reduced their long, relatively infinite lifespan to a limited lifespan, that is, they could live up to 80,000 years. Other races did not have such a long lifespan.

After the 80,000-year lifespan, the lifespan of human beings will decrease by one year every 100 years, and when Buddha Shakyamuni arrives in the human world, the lifespan will be reduced to only 100 years old.

Before Shakyamuni Buddha, three Buddhas were born, and Shakyamuni Buddha is the fourth Buddha.

After the Dharma of Burning Lamp Buddha was extinguished, it took a long, long time before Buddha Shakyamuni came into the world.

The teachings of Buddha Shakyamuni can last for 5,500 years in this world. After 5,500 years, the Buddha-dharma will cease to exist, and there will be no Buddha-dharma.

Now, more than 2,500 years have passed since the birth of Shakyamuni Buddha, almost half of the 5,500 years have passed, and there are still about 3,000 years left.

Therefore, if you don't cherish your human body this time and fall into the three evil realms, because the three evil realms have a very long period of time, you are likely to miss the teaching period of Buddha Shakyamuni.

176

When Maitreya Buddha is born, it will take almost another 4.5 billion years.

That is to say, from now on, more than 3,000 years from now, until the 4.5 billion years when Maitreya Buddha came into the world, people who come to this world will not encounter the Buddhadharma, nor even hear the Buddha's name, nor will they be able to hear the Buddha's name. Can't see the Buddha statue.

In such a long period of time, no matter how he reincarnates as an adult, he will not be full of time.

(2) Born in areas without Buddhism or not believing in Buddhism. Even if you are reborn in an era when there is Buddhadharma, if you are born in an area where there is no Buddhadharma, such a human body is not a perfect human body.

For example, if you are born in the Middle East, you will not be full of time.

Or even if you were born in an area where the Dharma exists, but you do not believe in the Dharma, you are not a perfect human being.

For example, in Tibetan areas, it can be said that 99 percent of the people believe in Buddhism, but there are still some people who do not believe in Buddhism.

For example, if you believe in Bon religion, Bon religion is a primitive religion in Tibetan areas, not Buddhism. Such a person is not a leisurely person.

(3) Deaf-mute or dementia-disabled persons Deaf-mute or dementia-disabled persons will have many obstacles in their practice. They are not those who have the foundation to study the Dharma, nor are they full of time.

177

(4) Those who cling to wrong views, do not believe in cause and effect, and cling to wrong views, do not have a leisurely life.

Clinging to wrong views is the biggest obstacle to the human way, so Nagarjuna Bodhisattva listed clinging to wrong views as the first of the eight flawless in the Book of Relatives and Friends.

The above four are the adverse conditions of the human body.

Four kinds of adverse conditions for non-human beings The four types of adverse conditions for non-human beings mean that after reincarnation, they are reborn in the three lower realms and the heaven of longevity. These four kinds of beings themselves do not have the conditions to practice Buddhism.
(1) If the life in hell goes to hell, the body and mind will be constantly occupied by pain, there is no way to practice at all, and there is no condition for leisure.

(2) If the beings in the realm of hungry ghosts are reborn in the realm of hungry ghosts, because of extremely strong hunger and thirst, they will only look for food and drink, there is no possibility of practicing the Dharma, and they are not full of leisure.

178

(3) The life of the animal Dao All beings in the animal Dao are relatively ignorant and unable to practice, and they are also not full of leisure.

(4) In the four days of the colorless realm of the life of the Longevity Heaven, the celestial beings of the Longevity Heaven just have the feeling of being born at the moment of their birth, and then they enter into samādhi.

After entering meditation, you will be in a coma. In this state, you can live for 80,000 kalpas. When you wake up, you will die, and you will fall into the evil realm in future generations.

Therefore, being born in the days of longevity is not full of leisure.

Some people practice meditation indiscriminately, unaware that their minds have been in subtle drowsiness. After such people die, they will be reincarnated as heavenly beings in the Formless Realm of Longevity.

(2) Eight-time-free human beings Having no time is the opposite, and our present human body is eight-time-free human beings.

Eight free human beings refer to those who were born in the era of Buddhism; the area where there is Buddhism and believe in Buddhism; the six Dharmaculties are complete; not beings in hell; not beings of hungry ghosts; not beings of animals; not beings of longevity.

179

(3) The ten perfect human body The ten perfect human body includes ten kinds of perfection: born as a human; born in the middle earth; complete with all six Dharmaculties; not committing the five uninterrupted sins; pure faith in the Three Jewels; ; Destined to study.

The Ten Consummations are further divided into Self Consummation and Other Consummation.

To be born as a human being, one must be born as a human being, and to be born as a human being has the opportunity to practice.
There are human beings in all four continents. Among the four continents, the people from the southern Zhanbu continent are the smartest and the most wise; the people from the northern continent are very long-lived, they can live a thousand years, but they are relatively stupid. If Ni Buddha was born in Beiguluzhou, it would be impossible to save so many sentient beings, because the sentient beings there are very stupid.

Why was Buddha born in India? Because the people who teach the scriptures and the Dharma must be able to understand the Dharma, the Indians at that time were very smart, so the Buddha Shakyamuni was born in India.

Being born in the middle earth means the place where the Dharma exists and where the four groups of disciples of Buddhism exist: bhikkhus and nuns, upasakas and upasikas.
180

This kind of area is called Middle Earth, or it refers to the area where the esoteric method is well preserved.

The six Dharmaculties are the eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, and mind.
The eyes can read scriptures; the ears can hear the Dharma; the mouth can recite scriptures; the body can meditate and practice; the mind can distinguish between good and evil karma.

Only when the six Dharmaculties are complete can one listen, think, and cultivate.

The five innocent sins that have not been committed are: killing the Dharmather, killing the mother, killing an arahant, destroying the Sangha, and giving birth to the body and blood of a Buddha.
Those who have committed the five innocent sins have very heavy karma, and it is difficult for them to enter Buddhism.

Pure faith in the Three Jewels Belief in the Three Jewels and have full confidence in the Three Jewels.
The above are the conditions that we should have, so it is called self-consummation. We have these five conditions ourselves.

181

When the Buddha was born Although we were not born in the age of the Buddha, there are many incarnations of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas in the world today.
For example, now there are many teachers with perfect virtues who are teaching sutras and teachings, and meeting a master with perfect virtues will satisfy this condition.

When encountering Buddhas and teachings, some Buddhas are born in the human world. When people have no wisdom, no one seeks the Dharma. If a Buddha is born today, he may pass away the next day.
This is not the case with Buddha Shakyamuni. He lived in the human world for 80 years and taught scriptures and Dharma for 45 years.

After the Buddha's extinction, Venerable Atisha, Master Tsongkhapa, and other incarnations of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas also preached the scriptures and taught the Dharma. These extraordinary Dharma doors have been passed down to the present, and they all belong to the Dharma of encountering Buddhas.

Not only that, the teachings of Master Tsongkhapa, who are both esoteric and esoteric and pure in view and conduct, are the teachings that were rectified by Master Tsongkhapa, in fact, Manjushri Bodhisattva himself.

This teaching has absorbed the essence of the old and new schools in India and Tibet, and has discarded all impurities. It is like pure gold after purification. It is extremely rare. It is really difficult to encounter such a teaching.

182

The Fourth Panchen Lama once said: "Among the people who have attained a human body full of leisure, the rarest are those who can practice both monasticism and esoteric practice.

Because among the 84,000 dharma-doors, the only one that includes the teaching of the complete perfection of both the sutra and the esoteric is the teaching of Master Tsongkhapa, and it is the most rare to encounter such a teaching.

"It illustrates the difficulty of obtaining a life full of leisure and encountering the teachings of Master Tsongkhapa, and it also illustrates the greatness of Master Tsongkhapa's teachings.

The Buddhadharma exists in the world in which we are now being reborn. Not only does the Buddhadharma exist, but even the rare Buddhist Dharma that has been fully cultivated in both esoteric and esoteric practice still exists.

Believing in Buddhism We not only believe in Buddhism and convert to Buddhism, but also study Buddhist scriptures from our masters, so we have the condition to believe in Buddhism.

It is very rare to have the predestined relationship to study and study the Dharma.

First of all, you need to meet a teacher who has the qualities of virtue; you need to have time to practice the Dharma; you need to know how to practice.

183

Now it seems that, fortunately, we all have these karma.

It is very rare to meet a truly virtuous guru who has not deceived the believers. This is one of the important conditions for the outer condition.

In addition, the more important conditions are the environment for learning Buddhism and the pure lineage.

It is very important to have a group of Dharma friends who can study together. Such an environment is very important. Everyone can learn from and encourage each other.

I have been to some places, and some people said that he was the only person nearby to study Buddhism, and it was very difficult.

Therefore, it is very painful to not have a good environment for study and cultivation, and the fate of being a Dharma friend is rare, and it is also an important condition for study and cultivation.

Many people don't understand this principle, and they have a sense of distinction between Dharma friends and fellow practitioners. This is inappropriate. Everyone should cherish each other.

These five conditions require external fulfillment, so it is called his perfection.

The above eight have leisure and ten are perfect, and a human body that fulfills all these eighteen conditions is a human being of leisure and perfection.

Sakya Mahasiddha Drakpa Gyaltsen said:

To fill the human body with leisure is not obtained by strength, but is the fruit of accumulation of blessings.

184

That is to say, obtaining a human body with eight leisures and ten perfections is not because of how powerful one's own abilities are, nor because of how outstanding status, wealth, and reputation are, but because of the accumulation of blessings over many kalpas and the diligent practice of ten good deeds. , the good fruit is obtained.

Therefore, a person who is full of leisure is also called a person with good conditions.

2. The Value of a Leisurely Human Body Now, we must think about ourselves, whether we have obtained a Leisurely Human Body or not.

Think again, have you realized that the leisurely human body is a very precious human body, and realized the value of the leisurely human body?

Relying on a leisurely human body can achieve countless benefits, so a leisurely human body is really a very, very precious kind of human body.

(1) Obtaining a human body full of leisure can benefit the present life and the future life. Obtaining a human body full of leisure can not only gain longevity and wealth in this life, but also achieve success in the next life.

If you want to be a wealthy person in this life, you can use this body to do it. For example, through mantra, offering Mantra is the Dharmastest and best way to accumulate blessings.

If you want to be healthy and live a long life, you only need to have the cause of longevity, such as cultivating the Buddha of Longevity, releasing animals and so on.

185

In the next life, if you want to become a great god in the world like the King of Great Freedom, you can also do it with this body.

A person who is full of leisure can sow the causes that bring about these results.

(2) After obtaining a human body full of leisure, you can be reborn in any pure land. After obtaining a human body full of leisure, if you want to be reborn in the Western Paradise of Ultimate Bliss or the pure land of other Buddhas and Bodhisattvas in the next life, you can do it.

If you want to be reborn in the Western Paradise of Ultimate Bliss, as long as you recite Amitabha Buddha more often, visualize the Paradise of Ultimate Bliss more, make more vows, make good blessings, and then return the blessings to the Paradise of Ultimate Bliss, and you can be reborn in the Paradise of Ultimate Bliss in the next life.

If you want to be reborn in the dakini pure land and other pure land, you can also.

(3) After attaining a human body full of leisure time, one can liberate and become a Buddha. After obtaining a human body full of leisure time, not only can one be reborn in the Pure Land, but if one wants to be liberated in this life, or become a Buddha immediately, one can do it.

Therefore, the human body full of leisure is the most precious human body.

If you don't practice and make good use of such a human body, it's a huge waste.

In the Treatise on Entering Bodhisattva Actions, it says:

186

If you don't take advantage of this to practice good deeds, you will not be more miscalculated than this, and there will be nothing more stupid than this.

To have a good body is to fill the human body with leisure.

That is to say, if you don't earnestly practice good deeds after you get a life full of people, it will be the most stupid, the most miscalculated, and the biggest loss.

(4) Compared with being born in the Land of Ultimate Bliss, a person who is full of leisure can quickly become a Buddha. My great teacher, Gazang Qusong, said: "It is more difficult to obtain a human body of full leisure than to be born in the world of Ultimate Bliss. In terms of value, being born in the world of bliss is the most precious and precious thing compared to being born in this world and obtaining a human body of leisure!”

why? Because even if you are born in the Land of Ultimate Bliss, becoming a Buddha is still very difficult and the time is very long.

In the Land of Ultimate Bliss, first Amitabha Buddha is the master, and after Amitabha has lived in the world for countless kalpas, Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva is the master of Ultimate Bliss, and then it is Mahasattva Bodhisattva.

When Amitabha was the master, some people lived in the Land of Ultimate Bliss and experienced countless kalpas, but Dharmailed to become a Buddha; when Avalokitesvara was the master, they went through countless kalpas and still Dharmailed to become a Buddha; In the time of the world, after going through countless kalpas, one can become a Buddha.

187

Because even though there is no suffering in the Land of Ultimate Bliss, and you have never even heard the name of suffering, you are very happy and will not turn back.

But just because there is no disobedience, the accumulation of merit will be very slow.

Despite daily practice, becoming a Buddha is still very slow and difficult, so the Bodhisattvas of Ultimate Bliss made a vow: "I want to be born in a Saha world, get a human body full of leisure, and become a Buddha quickly."

In the Saha world, after obtaining a man of leisure, if he is a Vajra disciple with the best foundation, he can become a Buddha in three years and three and a half months; an ordinary person with a lesser foundation can become a Buddha in seven years, or twelve years, or This becomes a Buddha.

A day in the world of bliss is equivalent to hundreds of years in our world. We can become Buddhas after practicing in the Saha world for more than ten years, which may be equivalent to half a day or an hour or two in the world of bliss. Therefore, the bodhisattvas of the blissful world They all vowed to be born in the Saha world, because the human body is too precious and rare.

(5) Compared with being born in the Land of Ultimate Bliss, a person who is full of leisure is very, very precious.

why? One of the reasons is that after learning Buddhism in this human body, the merits arising from the purity of the precepts are very Dharmast, and the blessings obtained are also great.

188

Especially in the Saha world, when people's troubles are getting bigger and bigger, even if a precept is pure, the blessings will be huge.

At the end of the spread of Buddhism in India, the blessings of sentient beings decreased, and in the end, there were no more blessings, and the Dharma gradually disappeared.

After the Buddha Dharma disappeared in India, the Han and Tibetan areas of China continued to promote the Dharma.

The Buddhist teachings in these areas have also been destroyed several times. In the Han region, the three martial arts destroyed the Buddha in a week, and in the Tibetan region, Langdama destroyed the Buddha in the pre-prosperous period.

Every time the Dharma is destroyed, the blessings that practitioners receive from keeping the precepts cleanly increase a lot more than before.

When the Buddha's Dharma was not destroyed, a bhikkhu in the Land of Ultimate Bliss purifying and practising more than 250 precepts for a hundred years would obtain the same blessings as a bhikkhu in a Saha world who kept the precepts for a day and night in the end of the Dharma era.

Before the Buddha Dharma was destroyed, keeping all the precepts pure and keeping the precepts for a hundred years, and keeping the precepts pure for one day and night after the Buddha Dharma was destroyed, the reward is the same.

This is because the magnitude of the merit of keeping the precepts is related to the difficulty of keeping the precepts.

The more difficult it is to keep the precepts, the greater the merit of being able to keep the precepts cleanly; the smaller the difficulty, the smaller the merit.

It is very easy for monks in Elysium to keep the precepts.

Because there is no suffering in the Land of Ultimate Bliss, there are no obstacles to keeping the precepts, and the precepts will naturally be pure;

189

Therefore, keeping the precepts cleanly for hundreds of kalpas in the Land of Ultimate Bliss is the same as keeping the precepts cleanly for one day in the human world.

Especially after the Dharma is destroyed, the merit of practice is greater, and the blessings grow Dharmaster. Unfortunately, not many people actually practice.

(6) Compared with being born in the Land of Ultimate Bliss, the time spent cultivating compassion and bodhicitta in a person who is full of leisure is short, and the blessings are great in the Land of Ultimate Bliss. Because there is no suffering, cultivating compassion and compassion for hundreds of kalpas is comparable to that of cultivating compassion in the Saha world in an instant. The merits are the same.

Similarly, the sentient beings in the Land of Ultimate Bliss themselves do not know what suffering is, let alone feel the suffering of other sentient beings and initiate the bodhicitta that saves all sentient beings from suffering and attains happiness. Bodhicitta is very difficult to initiate.

3. Conditions for Obtaining the Leisurely Human Body To obtain the Leisurely Human Body, three conditions must be met:

190

(1) Purity of the precepts The reason for obtaining a leisurely human body is the purification of the ten good precepts.

Even if one obtains an ordinary human body, among the ten virtues, at least one of the precepts must be pure.

It is very, very difficult to achieve the ten virtues of precepts.

Don't kill, don't steal, don't commit adultery, don't tell lies, don't tell right and wrong, don't speak slander, don't swear, don't greed, don't hate, don't cling to wrong views, these are called the ten good precepts.

Only the first commandment, "Don't kill," is very difficult to do.

The ten good precepts must be completely purified, so that in the next life one can obtain a human body of leisure and perfection. From this alone, one can see how difficult it is to obtain a human body of leisure and perfection.

(2) In order to attain the perfect human body by practicing generosity and other six degrees, in addition to the purity of the precepts, one must also practice the six paramitas.

The Six Paramitas are also known as the Six Degrees. If you do not cultivate the Six Degrees, you will only obtain an ordinary human body. Only by practicing the Six Degrees can you obtain a Leisurely Human Body that is capable, suitable for practice, and possesses various good conditions.

Even if you can't cultivate all the six degrees, you must at least cultivate generosity, patience, meditation, and prajna among the six degrees.

Giving includes Dharma Giving, Wealth Giving, and Fearless Giving. It is necessary to cultivate these three kinds of generosity. If you don’t cultivate generosity, you will not have the blessings of a happy and full human body.

191

You also need to cultivate forbearance. If you don’t cultivate forbearance, even if you get a man of time, your appearance will be uglier.

If you don't practice meditation, even if you get a human body, your mind will not be easy to settle down.

If you don't practice Prajna Paramita, you will get lower human wisdom power.

If the appearance is not upright, the appearance is not solemn, and sentient beings will not be happy when they see it, and there will be a little obstacle in saving sentient beings.

Unsettled mind and lack of wisdom are all obstacles to practice.

(3) To make good vows To make good vows is to make pure vows, such as vows: "I wish to obtain a human body that is full of leisure and life, and a human body that promotes the Dharma and benefits life."

Only by making such a wish can one obtain a man of leisure.

This kind of special vow is also very difficult to initiate, because sentient beings are in samsara, their minds are always dominated by ignorance, it is difficult to purify, and it is even more difficult to generate this kind of vow.

4. The rare nature of human beings full of leisure The Buddha said that the living beings in the evil way are like the dirt on the earth, and the beings in the good way are like the dust on the fingernails.

Among the six realms, the hell realm has the largest number of sentient beings, hundreds of times more than other realms.

There are also many sentient beings in the animal realm and the hungry ghost realm, and the human beings in the heavenly realm are the fewest in number.

192

There are few sentient beings in the good way because it is difficult for sentient beings to do good deeds and keep good precepts.

There are many sentient beings in the evil realm because it is easy to do evil, so most sentient beings fall into the evil realm in later life.

The Buddhist scriptures also say:

Most people in the world tend to be unrighteous,

Therefore, most people in the mortal world fall into the evil realms.

And among the human beings, the rarer ones are those who have obtained a human body full of leisure.

There are three metaphors in the Buddhist scriptures, which illustrate the rare nature of a human being full of leisure.

The first analogy is: There is a plank floating on the sea, and there is a hole in the middle of the plank.

There is a blind tortoise at the bottom of the sea that comes to the surface every hundred years.

When the tortoise is out of the sea, when will it meet the plank, and the head can fit into the hole in the middle of the plank? We all know that this is almost impossible.

In this parable, the sea is likened to the sea of ​​samsara, the tortoise is likened to all beings, blindness is likened to ignorance, and the tortoise is like a human being when it emerges from the sea and enters the hole in the plank.

Therefore, everyone understands: Because of ignorance, we have been in the six realms of reincarnation, and it is very difficult to obtain a human body.

The second analogy is: if you throw a toss on a smooth wall

193

Peas, even if sprinkled for a hundred years, not a single pea will stick to the wall.

After people die, like peas thrown to the wall, they fall into the evil realm one after another, and the chance to get a life full of people is rarer than peas sticking to the wall.

The third analogy is: a steel needle is stuck upside down on the ground, and mustard seeds are thrown at the tip of the needle. It is very difficult for the small mustard seeds to stay on the tip of the needle, and they all fall to the ground.

The same is true after death. It is almost impossible for a person not to fall into the evil realm, to be rescued, and to obtain a chance to fully rejuvenate a human body.

In addition, Master Bodova also has several metaphors for the rareness of the human body in the Collection of Metaphors:

Insects worship and ride wild deer, and Zangba eats fish and fried dough.

Here are four stories, the first one is the pilgrimage of insects. It means that a little worm in the ground, after burrowing out of the ground, worships the Buddha, saying that he takes refuge in the Three Jewels of the Guru. We all know this is almost impossible. This allusion metaphors that after beings are freed from the evil realm, the possibility of gaining a human body is as rare as a bug that can worship.

The second story is riding a wild deer. This allusion says that there was a blind man named Zhugu who fell off a cliff when he was walking because his eyes could not see.

At this time, a wild deer happened to come under the cliff, and Zhugu the blind fell on the back of the wild deer, and then he hugged the wild deer tightly. When the wild deer calmed down, the blind man sang happily.

People on the side of the road asked him, what are you proud of, you blind man, the blind man said, I am a blind man who fell off a cliff and didn’t fall to his death, and I can ride a wild deer, how can I be unhappy.

This story shows that after we fall into the evil realm, we can be rescued and get the chance to get a human body, just like a blind man riding a wild deer.

The third story is that Zangba eats fish. There was a person from the Zangba area. Once, when he came back from outside, his wife made fish for him to eat. Because he had never eaten fish before, he thought it was very fragrant, so he ate a lot of it, and he felt nauseous.

At this moment, he immediately took off the shoelaces and tightened his throat with the shoelaces. Someone asked, "What are you doing?"

He said: "It's a pity to spit out the fish after I finally got it."

We should also cherish the time and life we ​​have obtained just like the Tibetan people cherish fish and meat.

The fourth story is fried dough.

One year there was a Dharmamine in the Tibetan area, and everyone was short of food.

In one Dharmamily, my Dharmather went out to beg for food, and he got a little fried noodles, made some dough, and distributed a little to everyone in the Dharmamily.

There was a little child who was very ghostly. He hid the dough from his Dharmather behind him, and then asked his Dharmather for it. Dad gave him some more. After he ate it, he turned around and saw that the dough behind him was eaten by the dog. Crying loudly, he said, the fried noodles that he finally got were eaten by the dog.

195

This parable shows that we must cherish the human body that we have obtained with great difficulty.

To truly make good use of one's own human body for liberation and Buddhahood, one should not easily waste the rare leisurely human body.

These are a few rare allusions that Master Bodova told about Leisure Man.

If we can truly cultivate, we can achieve liberation, attain Buddhahood, be reborn in the Land of Ultimate Bliss, or obtain a human body of leisure once again in our next life.

You can get what you want, but if you don't cherish it and don't practice, you'll really be wasting your time and life.

If you know the conditions for obtaining a human body of leisure, you will understand how difficult it is to achieve a human body of leisure, because the causes and conditions of those conditions are difficult to meet.

Specifically, it is difficult to plant the seeds of a leisurely human body; even if they are planted, it is difficult to protect them; even if they work hard to protect them, the good fruits of a leisurely human body are difficult to fully mature.

(1) Seeds that fill the human body with leisure It is difficult to sow seeds that fill the human body with pure vows.

It is hard to say whether the seeds of this kind of wish have been planted, and even if they are planted, whether they will germinate and grow in the future.

196

(2) It is difficult to protect the seeds of a human being of leisure, and after making good vows, one has to practice the ten good precepts, and then it is possible to obtain a human being of leisure.

Even after cultivating the Ten Virtuous Precepts, one can accumulate the blessings of obtaining a human body of leisure and perfection, but because there are many factors that consume the blessings, it is not always possible to obtain a human body of leisure and perfection in the end.

For example, if you lose your temper and anger before you die, or you hold wrong views of unbelief in cause and effect, etc., you will destroy the good deeds of the past kalpas, and the seeds of the human body will not be able to achieve good results.

Therefore, this seed is difficult to maintain.

(3) It is difficult for the retribution of the human body to be fully mature even if there is no accidental consumption of blessings, no tantrums, no jealousy, and the ten good precepts, vows, and six perfections are also cultivated.

But at the end of life, compared with the blessings and rewards of life after life, if the karma is heavy, the results of bad karma will appear first, and the good results of the human body will be delayed, and it will be difficult to fully mature.

You may even fall into the evil realm. This is the karma of the world, and no one can change it.

Buddhist scriptures say:

Those with extremely heavy karma in the world, near karma and habitual karma,

The first industry, etc., in order, mature in turn.

When the karma is the same as the blessing, it is difficult to say which one will come out first. When the size is a little bit different, the bigger one will come out first.

So we need to repent often, try our best to reduce karma, and don’t let it have the opportunity to mature.

Moreover, after falling into the evil realm, there is absolutely no chance to practice good dharma, and will continue to create karma, making it difficult to escape.

It is much more difficult to cultivate a human body full of leisure after being reborn in an evil realm than to cultivate and become a Buddha with a human body full of leisure now.

5. Cherish Leanman's Human Body After obtaining Leanman's human body, most people do not realize its value and can cherish Leanman's human body.

Instead, he lived his life in confusion and incomprehension.

Some people even rely on human beings to create a lot of karma, fall into the evil realm after death, and waste this rare and full human life.

In addition, some people have great blessings, they do well in their worldly careers, they make a lot of money, and they also do a lot of good deeds.

198

However, this can only obtain temporary benefits, obtain wealth in this world or the fruits of human beings and heaven, and cannot solve the major events of life after life, let alone become a Buddha. It can also be said to be a waste of time and life.

To escape from the cycle of the six realms, until liberation and becoming a Buddha, we must use our body to cultivate. However, most people do not understand the characteristics of their own bodies, nor do they realize the special qualities of the human body.

Our Nanzhanbuzhou people are very special and have many unparalleled characteristics.

For example, in order to liberate and become a Buddha, one must cultivate precepts, concentration, and wisdom.

The five precepts in the precepts and other virtues of the precepts of liberation and liberation must rely on renunciation to truly arise.

However, beings in the three evil realms are always suffering, starving, and fearful, and beings in the heavenly realm are always enjoying themselves. It is difficult for these beings to renounce renunciation, and they may not even have the thought of renunciation.

In the Saha world, although the people of Beijulu continent have great blessings, they are relatively stupid and not suitable for ordination. Among the other three continents, only those of us in the southern Zhanbu continent can generate renunciation and obtain the most extraordinary precepts and virtues. .

In addition, the bodhicitta necessary for becoming a Buddha is also the most powerful in our human body. Therefore, Nagarjuna Bodhisattva said in the Book of Disciples:

If you want to become a Buddha and save sentient beings, only human beings can have great mental power.

The Tianlong Shura golden-winged python is not as good as the immortals.

199

This is also the case for upholding the Tantric precepts. Moreover, the most extraordinary of Tantric Buddhism is to become a Buddha, and it also requires a womb-born human body with the six elements (flesh, skin, blood, bone, marrow, and essence). Flesh.

Therefore, in order to achieve Buddhahood and liberation, it is most suitable to use our human body to practice, with the greatest mental strength, the best conditions, and the Dharmastest Buddhahood.

After understanding this, we should be able to realize that relying on the human body to practice liberation will be Dharmaster.

Therefore, after you have obtained a human body full of leisure time, you cannot waste it. Ma Ming Bodhisattva said in the Treatise on the Treasure Box of Good Talk:

Such as business to Baozhou, empty-handed to return home.

He deceived no more than this, no more than this great folly.

It means that there is nothing more stupid in the world than a businessman who, regardless of his life and death, goes to a treasure land full of treasures in the sea, and then goes home empty-handed without taking anything.

We should also think this way: just like when you arrive at the treasure island, you cannot go back empty-handed; if you get a wish-fulfilling treasure, you cannot throw it away at will.

Once you have obtained such a precious human body, you must cultivate it well and not waste it.

There was once a royal Dharmamily in India. During the war, the Dharmamily was destroyed and there was only one person left. Everyone took everything from their Dharmamily, and only a large and heavy piece of agarwood remained.

200

In order to make a living, he took the agarwood to sell on the street. Everyone saw that this piece of agarwood was too precious to buy.

He was in a hurry. At this time, he saw someone selling charcoal next to him, and many people were buying it, so he burned the agarwood into charcoal and sold it.

Once you have obtained a precious human body, if you do not practice the Dharma diligently, it is equivalent to burning this precious human body.

If you can think of it: it would be a pity to waste your time.

With this kind of awareness, the notion that a human being full of leisure is rare arises easily.

Being close to a good person and being able to meet a worthy teacher is the outer condition for learning and cultivating the Dharma; one is a person who is free and full of time, and has the eighteen conditions of being free.

Learning Buddhism requires many different conditions. These two are the biggest and most important. We have already satisfied these two conditions. In this life, we should diligently practice the Dharma, so as not to waste our time and life.

201

The second section correctly understands that the Dharma heart must be close to the guru, which is the foundation of the Tao.

It is the lower, middle, and upper clergy.

Where to start learning Buddhism, that is to start with the clergy way, the most difficult thing to cultivate is the corporal way.

Some people start cultivation directly from the Middle Way, which is impossible to achieve. If you want to achieve success, you must first cultivate the Lower School.

The Tao is the Tao. If you have the Tao, you can achieve it. If you don’t follow the Tao, you can only accumulate some blessings, and it is impossible to get liberation.

The foundation of Shangshidao is zhongshidao, the foundation of zhongshidao is sergeant Dao, and the basis of lower shidao is to be close to the teacher, so being close to the teacher is the foundation of Dao.

To become a Buddha, one must cultivate these three paths.

1. The goal of Sanshidao The goal pursued by the corporal priesthood is not to fall into the evil path.

Including the impermanence of life, the suffering of the three evil paths, taking refuge, and respecting cause and effect.

These four parts are to be cultivated by the mortals, and the result of achievement is the fruit of human and heaven.

The goal pursued by the zhongshi Tao is to liberate oneself and obtain the fruit of Arahantship.

To attain Arahantship, one must have renunciation. On the basis of renunciation, one can then cultivate the Four Noble Truths of Suffering, Accumulation, Elimination, and Path.

There are also two kinds of methods, one is to cultivate the twelve dependent origins, and the other is to cultivate morality, concentration, and wisdom. These three are the methods of the zhongshi way. You can practice any one of them, and you can achieve the status of Arahant.

202

The goal pursued by Shang Shidao is to become a Buddha, and the methods to be cultivated are compassion, bodhicitta, six paramitas, and four sets.

After attaining the upper level, and then practicing the second stage of Tantra, the result obtained is becoming a Buddha, that is, obtaining the fruit status of a Buddha.

It is a real and thorough awakening, a great awakening!

2. Common and Uncommon Taos Three Shi Taos are divided into common and uncommon Taos.

Although the goals pursued by the three Taos are not the same, those who want to become Buddhas must first cultivate the lower sect, then the middle and finally the upper sect.

Let’s talk about common ground first.

Those who want to practice upper shido must do it, those who want to practice middle shido must do so too, and those who want to practice lower shido must do so as well.

Those who cultivate the three kinds of Dao must go through and cultivate the Dao, which is the common Dao.

What is the common corporal? The impermanence of life, the suffering of the three evil paths, taking refuge, and respecting cause and effect, all these must be cultivated.

However, the goal of pursuit is not to attain the fruit of human beings and heaven, but to attain the fruit of Arahantship or become a Buddha.

203

As for the common zhongshidao, if the goal of cultivating the zhongshidao is not to obtain the fruit of Arahantship, but to become a Buddha, to obtain the fruition of a Buddha, to renounce the Buddhahood, and then to cultivate disciplines such as precepts, concentration, and wisdom.

It is the common sergeant.

In addition to the common way, there are also different ways.

What is the uncommon corporal? If the person who cultivates the mortal way, the goal is only to get the fruit of man and heaven, it is the uncommon corporal way.

If the goal pursued by cultivating the sage path is to obtain the status of Arhat, and only to liberate oneself from samsara, then it is an uncommon sage path.

The Tao of Shangshi is not a common way, it is the only way to liberate and become a Buddha, and there is no common method.

3. The order of practice of San Shi Dao Some people have misunderstandings about San Shi Dao.

For example, some people say: "Why do you want to cultivate the path of the inferior? The fruit of the path of the inferior is the fruit of man and heaven. I want to be liberated, and I do not cultivate the path of the inferior."

Others said, "I want to become a Buddha. The fruit of the sage path is the fruit of Arahantship. I don't practice the sage path."

This is all wrong! Although to become a Buddha, one must cultivate the sage way.

However, the foundation of the upper way is the middle way, and the foundation of the middle way is the lower way. All three ways must be cultivated in order to become a Buddha.

204

Without the renunciation of the sage path, the bodhicitta of the upper sage path cannot arise.

Renunciation is the foundation of bodhicitta. With renunciation, one can truly appreciate the suffering of sentient beings in the six realms, and can have a very subdivided understanding of the suffering of sentient beings. After experiencing the suffering of sentient beings, it is easy to initiate great compassion and compassion.

Without great compassion and compassion, there is no bodhicitta.

The foundation of renunciation is the corporal view of impermanence in life.

Once the concept of impermanence is achieved, it is easy to cultivate to renunciation.

The foundation of the concept of impermanence is first to realize that the human body is rare, that is, the human body is full of leisure; to cultivate the concept of the rare human body, one must get close to the teacher, and the root of the Tao is to be close to the teacher; after getting close to and relying on the teacher, the Tao The concepts and methods of Taoism will naturally be understood.

If the practice procedures are not disordered, the achievement will be very Dharmast; if the procedures are disordered, there will be no way to achieve success.

If the path of cultivation is messy, it will be troublesome. Why is it difficult for people today to achieve success? It is because they do not understand the procedures, do not follow the procedures, and do not care about the order.

They all think about cultivating DaDharma, look down on corporal DaDharma, think it is a petty Dharma, and 100% of such people will not succeed because the procedures are messed up.

Just like taking a plane, you can't reach your destination if the route is messed up.

205

In the past, great siddhis were constantly appearing in Tibet. Why?

Because all of them practiced according to the Three Ways.

The Three Ways taught by Buddha Shakyamuni is the Great Prajna Sutra, the Three Ways taught by Maitreya Bodhisattva is "The View of the Majesty of the Present", the Three Ways taught by Nagarjuna are "The Treasures", and the Three Ways taught by Bodhisattva Asanga are Shidao is the "Five Parts of the Earth", and the three Shidao taught by the Venerable Atisha is the "Lamp for the Path to Enlightenment".

These sutras, no matter from which point of view, and no matter what kind of person they have, in the final analysis, they are all about the stages of the Bodhi path and the three ways.

Beginning with Master Tsongkhapa, most of the practitioners have spent their entire lives reading Master Tsongkhapa's Extensive Treatise on the Sequence of the Path to Enlightenment and A Brief Treatise on the Sequence of the Path to Enlightenment.

Some of the great siddhis of the past have recited the Bodhi path extensively and briefly a thousand times or three thousand times.

King Yongzeng once said:

"After I read The Brief Commentary on the Steps of the Path to Bodhi for 180 times, I really understood it.

And the more you look at it, the more you understand it, the more you look at it, the more you feel that the Dharma is connected to your heart. In the end, the Dharma truly subdues your heart. "

The Dharma King also said that although he received all the empowerments and all the Dharma doors of Rako Rinpoche, the ones that helped him the most were the Extensive Treatise on the Stages of the Bodhi Path and the Brief Treatise on the Stages of the Bodhi Path. are from these two books.

According to the experience of the great siddhas of the Gelug School, if you practice according to the procedures and don’t practice randomly, you can achieve the rank of the lower class in three years, the middle class in one year, and the upper class in one year. Among them, the most difficult one is the lower class .

After attaining the upper level, one can become a Buddha in a total of seven years by practicing Tantra for the second time. This is the time it takes for an ordinary person to attain the ultimate achievement through practice.

And those who are very rare in all aspects, such as the Vajra disciples who practice extremely diligently, can become a Buddha in three years and three and a half months.

This kind of excellence refers to those who have practiced Sanshi Dao in previous lives, and have achieved achievements, and have the foundation of inferior Shi Dao.

There is a book called "Liberation in the Palm of the Hand" taught by the order of the sermons. By learning and cultivating the three ways, liberation can really be mastered in one's own hands. There is such a certainty, and countless great achievers have also come this way.

Among the three kinds of Taoism, the corporal Tao is the most basic, and it is also the most difficult to learn and adhere to. Once you have achieved several concepts of the sergeant Tao, your practice will be very Dharmast.

At this time, even if someone comes to stop us from practicing the Dharma, it will not stop us.

Now, even if others encourage us to practice, we can't get up quickly, because everyone is still in the stage of corporal path, and we haven't crossed it yet.

San Shi Dao

The third part 3 "Treasures of the Dharmahai" Sanshidao

...

After death and fall, it is difficult to be settled in the end. There are only three treasures to save fear and believe.

Be very firm in taking refuge, and don’t let your learning be weakened.

Black and white karma is good and ingenious, and it is decided to choose between rationality and cultivation,

I am always working diligently, and those who are determined to get rid of it should be encouraged!

The nature of perfection and victory, which is the basis of the path, has never been enhanced.

Ben Gusi should study diligently, and the three disciplines have become delinquents,

Therefore, it is the real key to clear obstacles, and always have the four powers to practice repentance,

I am always working diligently, and those who are determined to get rid of it should be encouraged!

...

——"The Ode to the Steps of the Bodhi Path"

210

Chapter 1 The Shido Section 1 Life is impermanent, and you can't slack off, because life is impermanent, and it is constantly changing due to the harmony of karma.

We must recognize the impermanence of life, understand the impermanence of life, and often think about the impermanence of life.

After you have achieved the concept of impermanence in life, you will enter the lower priesthood. The concept of impermanence in life has many benefits for practice.

The concept of impermanence in life will give people a sense of urgency, which is conducive to diligent practice of the Dharma.

Before realizing that life is impermanent, you may sometimes think: "Although the Buddhadharma is precious and rare, life is still very long, and you can practice it slowly. If you don't practice the Dharma today, then you can practice it tomorrow, and you will have time to practice it when you are old."

There may be such a mentality.

In fact, it’s really hard to say whether a person can have a tomorrow. What if he dies today if he hasn’t practiced Buddhism yet? Some people lie down at night, don't wake up the next morning, and die in their sleep.

211

After understanding the impermanence of life, you will think: Whether you can live until tomorrow is not certain.

If you don't have time to practice the Buddhadharma, you just walk away empty-handed. What if you fall into an evil realm?

will begin to practice diligently.

When one does not realize that the human body is impermanent, the state of practice can easily regress.

After practicing for several years, the disciples of Venerable Atisha reported to the Venerable their respective achievements.

Some people say that they have attained supernatural powers, but the Venerable said that they are not achieved; some say that they have recited the six-syllable mantra 100 million times, but the Venerable still say that they are not achieved; some say that the concept of impermanence in life has arisen, and the Venerable immediately said happily after hearing this: "You're in the Dao, it's good."

Even if you recite the holy name of Amitabha Buddha 100 million times, there is no guarantee that you will not turn back.

However, if you realize the impermanence of life and develop the concept of impermanence in life, you will not retreat, and your practice will be more diligent.

Obtaining the concept of impermanence in life is beneficial to eliminate greed, hatred, and delusion, and reduce karma.

Once you have the concept of impermanence in life, you will realize that your body is like a hotel, and your soul is only temporarily living in this hotel.

212

in the hotel.

So, if the hotel is broken in some places, it doesn't care about it, and the ego doesn't grow.

If you think about it further, because life is impermanent, and how long you live in this world is not certain, in this way, your attachment to outsiders, things, and things will be weakened a lot.

If you are less attached, there will be no more troubles, no more bad karma, and no more bad karma.

Not only is it beneficial to practice, but it is also easy to obtain happiness in the world.

1. How to think about the impermanence of life So, how to think about the impermanence of life? First of all, we must understand the three fundamentals, nine reasons, and three decisions of the impermanence of life.

The three fundamentals of impermanence in life are: people are bound to die; not only will they die but also die indefinitely; when they die, there is no way to help them except the Dharma.

(1) Man is bound to die The first root of impermanence is that man is bound to die.

Man must die for three reasons, one decision.

The three reasons are: death is bound to come, and nothing can change it; life expectancy is decreasing all the time without increasing it;

213

One decision was: Dharma must be practiced.

Death must come, and nothing can change the four reasons why death must come.
(1) Born anywhere, death is inevitable. People must die.

There are four continents where people were born: Nanzhanbuzhou, Dongshengshenzhou, Xiniu Hezhou, and Beijuluzhou.

Among them, the people in Beijulu Continent will live a little longer and can live to be a thousand years old, and there are also people on the other eight small continents.

People are bound to die in whatever continent they are born in, and death cannot be avoided wherever they are born.

Therefore, it is said in JiDharma Jujing:

There is no place where death can be avoided,

There is nothing in the sky, nothing in the sea, and nothing in the forest.

If you are born in the sea, you will surely die, if you are born in the sky, you will surely die. There is no way to avoid death wherever you are born, and there is no place where you cannot die.

(2) Being born in any age cannot avoid death. Being born in any age will die.

Do not kill, do not steal, do not commit adultery, do not tell lies, these are called the four fundamental precepts.

The era when the four fundamental precepts are not violated is called the era of consummation.

Since ancient times, the Age of Consummation has lasted for a long, long time. With the growth of human greed, hatred, and delusion, some people have become greedy for food and drink, and there is a phenomenon of stealing. When they violate the precept of "not stealing", human beings enter The three-point era has entered; human beings have continued to develop, and adultery has appeared again, breaking the precept of "not committing adultery", and entering the era of two-pointing; then there is the phenomenon of murder, and the precept of "not killing living beings" has been violated.

Now, the four fundamental precepts have all been broken, which is called the era of conflict in Buddhism.

Life will die in the Age of Consummation, but lifespan will be a little longer.

If you are born in a three-point era or a two-point era, you will die.

Now is the era of conflict, and in the era of conflict, not only will people die, but death will come very quickly.

We can all see that now, it is very rare for a person to live to be 80 years old. Most people do not live to be 80 years old, they die at the age of 60 or 70, and many people die at the age of 30 or 40.

While everyone would like to live to be eighty years old, this idea really doesn't necessarily come true.

(3) No life can avoid death. Any life will die.

People will die, and animals will die; ordinary people will die, and powerful people will die; people in the Saha world will die, and so will heaven and human beings.

Any life will die, this is an unchangeable law of nature.

(4) There is no way of immortality except liberation, and there is no way to make a person immortal.

Under normal circumstances, we cannot change death by reciting mantras and sutras.

However, if you rely on the practice of Sanshidao, you are truly liberated, and you can break through the obstacles of birth, aging, sickness and death, but you still have to give up your current physical body.

Therefore, you cannot be attached to your own flesh.

When we practice to the extent that we can liberate, in the physical body, the soul will form a light body of consciousness the size of a seven or eight-year-old child, complete with all five Dharmaculties and very solemn.

After attaining the status of an arahant, if the light body of consciousness leaves the body, the arahant will pass away.

The Buddhas and Bodhisattvas of Mahayana are different from this. The light bodies of consciousness of Bodhisattvas in the eighth ground and above can come and go freely in the body.

If you don't want to give up your body, you can live for a long time.

For example, some yogis who practice Mahavira, a yogi named Zaya Wanzhida, lived to be a thousand years old; another named Jebejum lived to be five hundred years old.

Nagarjuna Bodhisattva lived for 600 years and was free to come and go. After 600 years, when he encountered another karma and decided to give up his physical body, he appeared and passed away.

216

The Buddhist scriptures say:

The Omniscient Buddha and the Enlightened Buddha, and the sage-hearers of the disciples of the Buddha,

also cast aside the physical body, not to mention other mortals,

Now, let's think about it, the Buddha, who has obtained the immortal vajra body, will also abandon the physical body according to the karma, and show the appearance of Nirvana. There were so many great siddhis in India and Tibet who achieved freedom of life and death, as well as Nagarjuna, Venerable Atisha, and Master Tsongkhapa, who have also passed away, and only their teachings remain. This is especially true for all of us. We will all die in a hundred years, and it is estimated that there will be no one left, no exception.

When impermanence comes, no force can save it. In the past, the city of Kapila, where the Buddha was located, was invaded by the King of Glass. The Buddha knew that this was the result of the common karma of the Sakyamuni Dharmamily in the past.

The Buddha dissuaded him three times with great compassion, and the King of Glazed Glass went back and forth, but this time he was unable to stop him.

When the Liuli King attacked the city, Mugallian wanted to use his miraculous power to bring the Liuli King's army outside the Tiewei Mountain, but the Buddha said it was useless.

So, Mujianlian hid some young men and women of the Shakya tribe in the Buddha's bowl. However, after the massacre, when the Shakya people died, this group of people also died.

It shows that Buddha power cannot stop karma.

217

Therefore, it is said in the "Abandoned Rock Mountain Sutra": "The incomparable wisdom and supernatural powers of the Buddhas are not as powerful as the power of impermanence, and the power of all Buddhas and Bodhisattvas combined is powerless to the lawful impermanence of death."

Then, can you save yourself by obtaining supernatural powers? In the Anthology of Impermanence, it says:

An immortal possessing the five powers, although he can travel thousands of miles in the air,

There is no death wherever it goes, and such a place is hard to reach.

That is to say, those immortals who have supernatural powers and obtain five supernatural powers, no matter how they change, how Dharmast they run with supernatural powers, they will not be able to run away from immortality, and they will not be able to run away from death.

Power and wealth are useless.

When the wheel-turning king's blessings are exhausted, he will also fall into the evil realm. The power and wealth of these worldly gods have no ability to stop death, let alone us ordinary people.

There is no way for doctors to immortality, and there is no panacea for immortality. This is known and seen by everyone.

In a word, there is no way to keep a person from dying.

Lifespan is decreasing all the time, without any increase Our lifespan is decreasing every day, even breathing is decreasing, life is decreasing every moment.
In the Treatise on Entering Bodhisattva Actions, it says:

Day and night without pause, this longevity is constantly diminished,

There is nothing left to add, how can I not die?

From the moment we emerge from the womb, our lives are diminished, every minute and second that passes.

If you can live to eighty years old, your life expectancy will be reduced by one year at the age of one year, and you will only be seventy-nine years old.

Life is decreasing all the time, there is no possibility of increasing it, and in the end it must die.

There is not much time in one's lifetime to practice the Dharma. If a person can live to be 80 years old, before the age of 20, he must learn and grow according to the customs of the world, and he will not think of practicing Buddhism. There are only sixty years left.
In sixty years, the time spent sleeping and eating three meals a day will never be less than twelve hours, so if you remove half of the time for eating and sleeping, there will be no time for thirty years.

In the remaining thirty years, the work will take fifteen years.

In the remaining fifteen years, if you don’t work hard, you are more fun, and you waste your time on pleasure, it’s hard to say whether you have five years of real cultivation, but five years is already very good.

Therefore, some people say that they have studied Buddhism for 20 years, but have they actually studied for 20 years? Maybe it was only 20 years ago that I started learning, and I spent ten years eating and sleeping, at least seven or eight years working, and maybe only one or two years of cultivation time.

He also said that after 20 years of cultivation, he has not achieved anything, so how could he have achieved success.

The Buddhist scriptures say:

Cruel and merciless death, before it comes,

Prepare all the good resources, don't regret it later,

The first decision: you must study the Dharma

By thinking about the first root of impermanence in life: people must die, and the three reasons why people must die, we have to make a decision: we must practice the Dharma.

Everyone must think clearly and clearly: in our life, we will surely die wherever we are born; we will surely die in any age; in this life, no matter what our fate is, we will surely die; our lifespan will decrease every day, no Increase.

If you don't practice the Dharma very much in your lifetime, you won't be sure where you will go in future generations. It's really scary!

Therefore, you must practice the Dharma, you must practice the Dharma!

220

(2) Not only will it die but also die indefinitely. The second root of impermanence in life is that it will not only die but also die indefinitely.

The three reasons for indeterminate death are: life is uncertain; there are many causes of death; and the body is extremely fragile.

The life expectancy of people in Nanzhanbuzhou is indeterminate, and it is said in the "Kushi Lun": The north is a thousand years old, and the remaining two and a half are reduced.
That is to say, in the four continents, the life expectancy of people on the other three continents is fixed.

People in Beiju Luzhou can live to a thousand years, and there is a regular period; the other two continents have a "half and half reduction" in their lifespan. People in Xiniu Hezhou can live 500 years; people in Dongshengshenzhou can live 250 years. Years old, have a regular.

Only the people in Nanzhanbuzhou are different, "the last ten years are immeasurable", the initial lifespan is immeasurable years, and at the end of the Five Turbid Age, ten years old is the longest lifespan, and the lifespan is very, very short.

Not only has a short lifespan, but it also dies indefinitely.

Some people die as soon as they are born, some die when they are children, or die in middle age or old age, and the time of death is uncertain.

221

There are many causes of death, and there are many causes of death, so there is no fixed period of death.
Causes of death are divided into internal and external obstacles.

In the past, Tibetan classics recorded that there were various troubles caused by internal obstacles that lead to death, and there were 424 cases of illness.

However, people in the Dharma-ending period now have thousands of diseases, and many people have died because of them. These diseases are all causes of death.

External obstacles are demonic obstacles, and 84,000 demonic obstacles are also the cause of death. Many people died because of demonic obstacles.

In addition, the disasters of earth, water, fire and wind are also the cause of death. Many people died of earthquakes, floods, fires, and wind disasters.

There are many, many causes of death, but very few causes of life, and causes of life sometimes become causes of death.

For example, the house was originally the cause of life, to protect our lives from wind and rain, but it can also become the cause of death. During an earthquake, the collapse of the house will crush people to death.

Diet is also the cause of life, and it will also become the cause of death. Many people get sick due to improper diet, or die from poisoning.

Therefore, Nagarjuna Bodhisattva said in the "Precious Garland":

There are many ties to death, but only a few ties to living.

Such things also become death, so one should always practice the Dharma.

...

Resting in death is like a candle in the wind.

It means that our life is like an oil lamp in a gust of wind. There are many deaths around us, but we are small and powerless, and may be extinguished at any time.

The body of a very fragile person is very fragile, so there is no regularity in death.
Although there are many causes of death and very few causes of life, if our bodies are indestructible, no matter how many causes of death, we are not afraid of them.

However, in fact, our physical body is very fragile.

For example, many people's bodies have fragile parts, which are the lifeblood, and a touch is Dharmatal.

Some people died after being slapped in the face. Everyone's lifeblood is different, and they don't know where they are.

This kind of example that can easily hurt people, everyone can say a lot.

There are several metaphors for the fragility of life in Buddhist scriptures: life is like an oil lamp in the wind, which is easily extinguished when lit in a strong wind; it is also like a bubble blowing on water, which is extinguished at once.

Nagarjuna Bodhisattva also said in the Book of Relatives and Friends:

Life is more harmful than impermanent. Blisters on the water are easy to burst.

There is life and death between breathing and breathing, and it is a miracle to wake up after sleeping.

It means that the impermanence of life is easier than the bursting of water bubbles, and there is life and death between breaths.

Because when a person enters a deep sleep, the coarse breathing stops, and only the very fine air is flowing. The next morning, this fine air is not broken, and the person can wake up again, which is actually a very rare thing. matter.

If you think about these three reasons, you will understand: we people in Nanzhanbuzhou have many causes of death, few causes of birth, and there is no fixed period of death.

And life is fragile, and even waking up after falling asleep is a miracle, and it’s true, but we don’t usually realize it.

So the scripture says:

Tomorrow and future generations, I don't know who will come first,

Abandoning tomorrow's afDharmairs should be for future generations.

Tomorrow or the afterlife, which comes first is unknown, and it is difficult to say where the afterlife will go.

Sometimes people hear that someone has died, but no one expects that person to die.

Everyone wants to live a long life, to live to ninety or one hundred years old, but they don't think about it.

224

The second decision: amend the law immediately

By thinking about the second root of impermanence in life: people not only die but also die indefinitely, and the three reasons for death indefinitely, we have to make a decision: immediately practice the Dharma.

Gongtang Rinpoche said in the "Study of Impermanence":

Before the dawn of tomorrow's practice of the Dharma, today's death is approaching,

Don't deceive yourself now and amend the law from now on.

Not only do people die, they die indefinitely.

Whether we die today or tomorrow, no one can be sure. Before death comes, we must decide to practice the Dharma today. This is very important!

In the "Guide to Bodhi", it is said that the most important of the three fundamentals is to think about death without a fixed period. Thinking about death without a fixed period can really change our concept and begin to diligently practice the Dharma.

If you procrastinate and do not practice the Dharma, you will regret it very much before you die.

In addition, if you procrastinate in the practice of the Dharma today and tomorrow, it will gradually turn into Dharma oil, and it will be even more difficult to control your mind.

There are several reasons for it to become oilseed.

Or, after hearing it, you don’t practice it, and you get tired of listening to it and you become oily seeds of the Dharma. It doesn't matter; or because of laziness, lack of effort, etc.

Therefore, learning must pay equal attention to listening, thinking, and cultivation.

The Kadampa Patriarch said:

The law can pacify sinners, but it is difficult to pacify oilseeds.

Oil can tan rough skins, but it is difficult to tan oily skins.

If you become Dharma oil seed because of other Dharma, you can also be taught by studying the Three Ways and contemplating the impermanence of life.

But if you also become slick with the steps, there is no cure, so be careful!

(3) At the time of death, no method can help except the Buddhadharma.

The third fundamental also includes three reasons: when you die, money can't help; relatives and friends can't help; body can't help.

When you die, when money can't help you die, how much money you have is useless, it can't help you, and you can't save people.
There are such examples around everyone. Some rich people died, put down hundreds of millions of assets, and left on their own.

So much money can't be exchanged for immortality in the face of death.

So, money can't help us when we die.

The third Kungtang Rinpoche also said:

Although there is gold and silver piled up in the valley, when you die, you can't take a penny with you.

When we die, our relatives and friends can't help us. How many relatives and friends can't save us.
The Fourth Panchen Lama said in "Dangers and Difficulties in Liberation":

Those who save money and silk are all abandoned, and all the loving Dharmamily members leave forever.

Sometimes, relatives and friends will be implicated in the person who is about to die. For example, at the end of life, if relatives and friends are crying non-stop, it will make the person who is about to die feel uneasy and worry. There may also be thoughts of covetousness for relatives, friends, and children, and even if you want to leave, you can’t leave.

That's why it says in the Treatise on Entering the Bodhisattva's Actions:

Come alone in life, go alone in death,

No one to share the pain, what's the use of hindering relatives and friends.

When you die, your body can't help. Now, we already know that wealth can't help when you're dying. You can't buy the medicine for immortality, and money can't redeem your life. Friends and Dharmamily can't help, let alone other people.
So, can you rely on your own body?

Everyone protects their own body every day like a wish-fulfilling treasure. I hope that this body will always be young and beautiful and accompany you.

But, in fact, the body is like a hotel, the soul is like a tourist, and a tourist cannot stay in a hotel all the time.

When fate runs out, the soul needs to change to a body, just like a tourist needs to change to a hotel when it’s time, but he can’t keep it if he wants to stay.

So, when you die, your body can't help either.

Decision 3: Only Amend the Law

By thinking about the third root of impermanence in life: when a person dies, property can’t help, relatives and friends can’t help, and even our own body can’t help, so we shouldn’t be attached to anything in the world.

The Impermanence says:

In the past and in the future, we must give up this body and leave,

The wise realize that everything is destroyed, and in the Dharma one must do the Dharma.

Now, we understand what can help us before we die, the Dharma that we have learned and practiced, and the "Om Mani Padme Hum" that we have recited.

228

Therefore, we decided: in the face of the coming death, we must put everything aside and only correct the law.

2. Appearances and Differences at the End of Life Since it is said that a person will surely die, then what happens when a person dies? What is the difference between those who study Buddhism and those who do not study Buddhism when they face death?

This is divided into two parts.

(1) Appearance of Dying To put it simply, when a person is dying, the energies of the four elements of earth, water, fire, and wind will all be received into the central channel, the soul will be in the middle, and then the energy of qi in the whole person will be received into the soul. , the soul will enter emptiness.

Those who practice at a high level will understand emptiness at this time, and will enter into concentration in emptiness, which is equivalent to liberation.

Those who practice well, some have been in meditation for more than 20 days, and before Tibet there were three months of meditation.

After entering meditation, from the outside, the person is meditating, the breath outside the body is completely cut off, the body temperature also cools, and the heart is warmer; the complexion is much better than before death, the wrinkles have disappeared, and the mouth before death is pale. At this time, it will become red, the face is also red, and the body will emit a sandalwood fragrance.

229

Such people are relatively high in cultivation, and for them, death is neither painful nor scary.

People with relatively good levels of practice can see Amitabha Buddha, Buddhas and Bodhisattvas before they die, and can be reborn in the Pure Land directly without going through the bardo body.

A person with an average level of practice will enter the bardo body after death. When he hears a terrifying sound or sees a terrifying sight, he will immediately think of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas to rescue him due to the habitual force of his practice during his lifetime. Then, with the power of his vows during his lifetime, he was led by Buddhas and Bodhisattvas to be reborn in the Pure Land.

For ordinary people who have poor practice or have not studied Buddhism, death is the heaviest and most painful suffering, because at this time there is no certainty or support.

However, if you can think of the Three Jewels of Guru at this time, you will not be afraid and will not fall into the evil realm.

(2) The difference between those who study Buddhism and do not study Buddhism at the end of life Although people are bound to die, the time of death is different.

Comparing those who study Buddhism and those who do not study Buddhism, at the time of death, there is the same difference between heaven and earth, and the difference is very large.

230

People who have no concept of Buddhism, because they do not understand the six realms of reincarnation, feel that only their own life is the most precious, and will feel very desperate when Dharmacing the life that is about to be lost.

And because there is no strength to rely on, I don't know what to do, and I am very scared.

Those who study Buddhism have realized that after the soul leaves, it will enter the cycle of reincarnation. In addition to this life, it can also be liberated and reborn in the Pure Land, and liberation from samsara is better than having the present life.

Because there are teachers and Buddhas and Bodhisattvas as backers, I will still think: I have studied Buddhism in this life, after death Amitabha will come to pick me up, and Dakini will come to save me.

Even if my karmic obstacles are not exhausted, I may suffer during death, during the bardo period, or in the next life, but there will be Buddhas and Bodhisattvas who will protect me.

Thinking about my life, I have recited many scriptures and mantras, and practiced many methods. I should not fall into the evil realm, I would not be afraid in my heart, and I would leave this world peacefully.

There is no ordinary person who is not afraid of death, unless it is a person with demonic, ghost, or non-human obstacles who is driven by these external forces and is not afraid of death.

Normal people will definitely be afraid of death, and people who have not studied Buddhism well will be even more afraid of death.

Those who earnestly study Buddhism will not be afraid. Those who study Buddhism well have already eliminated all major karma before death.

231

At the time of death, Amitabha Buddha or other Buddhas and Bodhisattvas will appear, or the Pure Lands of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas will appear, such as the Land of Ultimate Bliss, the Pure Land of Dakinis, and so on.

When they were dying, their state was even better than usual. Some even sang happily and left, while others recited "Om Mani Bai Mi Hum" and passed away.

In Tibetan areas, there are many elderly people who passed away in meditation when they were practicing Dakinis.

His face looks much better than before his death, with a smile on his face, and he is not afraid at all! Therefore, when a person who is a good Buddhist learner is about to die, he has no sense of fear.

A person who has achieved a higher level of Buddhist achievement will be greeted by Buddhas and Bodhisattvas when he dies. Dakinis, Dakinis, warriors, and brave mothers will come to meet him. The sound of drums and bells will sound in the sky, or other auspicious signs will appear. .

For example, if you die in winter, the weather may be warmer, the plants will bloom, etc.

There is a great siddha in Tibet called Kalu Phuntsok, who passed away in the eleventh month of the lunar calendar, which is the coldest season in Tibet.

When he passed away, the dakini Buddha came to greet him on his way to the dakini pure land. Many people heard the sound of bells and drums in the sky, and the climate became as warm as summer.

232

3. How to achieve the concept of impermanence in life Now, only by accumulating blessings, making good vows, and practicing the ten good precepts, we have obtained a human body with eight flaws and ten perfections.

Moreover, he has also met a master with the virtues, and he has the conditions to study Buddhism.

At the same time, I also recognize the impermanence of life and recognize that death will come at any time.

Think about the death that happened around you.

For example, some friends met last year and passed away this year. This is the impermanence of life.

It is also often heard that someone died of illness or accident.

Such impermanence can also happen to us at any time. What if we suddenly die one day, but our practice is not enough, what should we do if we fall into the evil realm?

Leaving indefinitely!

So, a decision should be made and the law must be revised immediately!

Think again, some people are very rich, but when impermanence comes, they get a terminal illness, spend a lot of money to buy the best medicine, but they can't save their lives, and they can't take the rest of their money with them; Can only leave alone.

Money, relatives and friends are useless when death comes, only the Buddha's Dharma is useful and is the only way out.

Therefore, for the sake of future generations, it should be decided that only the Buddha's Dharma must be practiced.

233

If you have to think like this often, you can also think about the situation before your relatives and friends died. If you have the opportunity, you should also look around. If someone dies, think about how they died, and think about what happened before and after death. Remind yourself that life is impermanent.

After realizing the concept of impermanence in life, the practice will not turn back at all times, and a courageous and diligent heart will arise, and the practice will gradually enter a better state.

At this time, I often think: I don’t know if I can live until tomorrow, so I must seize today and practice the Dharma; people and things in the world are not helpful to my death and future generations, so I should not be attached, I should have time Just fix the law.

Master Tsongkhapa's eldest disciple, Master Gyaltsab Je, is still very diligent in his old age. If someone wants to see him, please ask the waiter to inform him. The waiter said to Gyaltsab Je: "Master, someone wants to see you very much."

Gyaltsab Je refused and said, "Look at my hair turning white, I'm getting old, and you want me to see these people, why waste my time?"

But looking at ourselves, we are old, our hair is gray, and we are moving towards death step by step without realizing it.

There is still hope in my heart, and I want to live to the age of eighty or ninety. This is because I have not recognized impermanence.

If you have achieved the concept of impermanence in life, even if you have truly entered the Dao.

After entering the path, the idea of ​​liberation really arises from the depths of the heart.

At the beginning, many great achievers mainly practiced the concept of impermanence in life. Some people asked Venerable Atisha for the Dharma. The Venerable said: Learn to take refuge in the Three Jewels, recite the impermanence of death, and achieve the impermanence of life.

234

Among the disciples of Master Bodova, there are more than 3,000 people who have cultivated the concept of impermanence in life.

One of the disciples was retreating in a cave. There was a tree with thorns at the entrance of the cave. He was stabbed once when he went out of the cave, and he was stabbed again when he entered the cave. He thought: Tomorrow this tree will be cut down.

Then I thought again: I don't know if I can live until tomorrow, where will I have time to cut down trees.

In this way, until he finally cultivated the concept of impermanence in life, he lived in that cave in his twenties and lived until he was eighty-nine years old, until he passed away.

The third Kungtang Rinpoche opens his eyes every morning and thinks of the impermanence of life: Ah! I am not dead today, I am still breathing, this is the grace of the Three Treasures.

I must be liberated and become a Buddha! It's hard to say whether you can live until tomorrow, so be sure to practice diligently today!

We slowly think about the reasons for the impermanence of life one by one. We should think about it every day, and think about it all the time. This will greatly help our practice.

When you wake up in the morning, just think about the impermanence of life, and the big greed and troubles will naturally be put down.

Then continue to think: life is impermanent, and liberation is the only reliable way.

At this time, I vowed to be liberated, recited scriptures for liberation, and practiced in order to become a Buddha.

235

When I don’t realize that life is impermanent, even chanting scriptures is for the benefit of the world, in order to obtain the fruits of human and heaven.

236

Section 2: The Three Evil Realms Suffering We have already understood that life is impermanent, so have you ever considered, if you really die, where will the next life go?

Can you be reborn in a pure land? To be reborn in a good way or to fall into a bad way?

Always think about this yourself.

1. Reasons for falling into the Three Evil Realms Today's sentient beings have relatively heavy afflictions and often do evil karma.

After death, most of them, it can be said that 99% of people, will fall into the evil realm.

Among the ten evil karma, the big ones will go to hell, the moderate ones will go to the realm of hungry ghosts, and the small ones will go to the realm of animals.

The ten evil karmas, large and small, have the result of going to the three evil realms.

What is great evil? Great evil karma refers to the karma caused by great greed, hatred, and delusion, such as murder.

The karma that is often created is also a big bad karma when accumulated, such as often stealing valuables.

Now, let's think about it, have we done great evil karma?

Among the great ten evil karma, such as killing, have you ever had an abortion?

237

Have you ever killed someone? If there is, there is a reason for going to hell.

In other killing karma, have you killed small animals for a long time and in large numbers?

If there is, it is also a big killing, and it will go to hell.

Have you ever killed a wild animal or a large animal among the moderate killings? If there is, it is medium killing, and one will fall into the realm of hungry ghosts.

Small killings are relatively light killing karma. Killing one or two animals, or killing small animals, is the cause of falling into the animal realm.

Why does the size of the animal killed make the difference in the severity of karma? Because killing a small animal may kill you all at once, it is not so painful, such as killing an ant.

But if you kill a sheep, the pain will be great when the sheep dies, so the karma will be heavy.

Think again about the possibility of falling into other evil realms.

Think about how likely you are to fall into the realm of hungry ghosts. Stealing will fall into the realm of hungry ghosts, and miserliness will also fall into the realm of hungry ghosts.

After falling into the realm of hungry ghosts, when he reincarnates as a human being, he will also be a poor person.

Wonder if you've ever stolen something? Have you ever rejected someone because you were stingy when you needed help?

Think again, do you often tell lies? Do you scold people often? Are you often jealous of others? If this happens all the time, it will add up to big karma, and these karma will drag us into the three evil realms.

If you think about it like this, you will understand that in fact, we do a lot of bad karma, so it shouldn’t be too Dharmar from the three evil realms, and the possibility of falling into the evil realms in the next life is very large. If you repent, you will surely fall into the evil path.

238

2. Three Evil Realms Suffering and bad karma will pull us to the lower realm. In order not to fall into the lower realm, we must diligently practice the righteous Dharma.

At the same time, it is necessary to understand the suffering of the three lower realms. If you feel the suffering of the lower realms, you can have a strong fear of the lower realms, which will be of great help to your practice.

(1) Suffering in the hell realm "On Entering the Bodhisattva's Actions" says:

The karma created in an instant will spend a thousand years in hell.

When bad karma cannot be eliminated, life will not cease.

The karma created in an instant will lead to the retribution of going to hell. After going to hell, you will spend hundreds of kalpas in hell until the karmic retribution is exhausted.

For example, the karma created in the moment of being angry with the teacher will go to hell.

Think about the karma we have created in this life, and then think about the karma accumulated over countless lifetimes, and you will understand that if we do not practice, we will definitely go to hell.

239

Being incarnated in this world is just because the blessings are a little bigger, and they are manifested first.

So, what is the pain of going to hell?

There are four types of hell: hot hell, marginal hell, cold hell, and scattered hell.

These four kinds of hells can be further subdivided, with a total of eighteen levels of hells.

In Bodhgaya, India, 32,000 yojanas (1 yojana is about 13 kilometers) below the seat of Vajra, where the Buddha became enlightened, is the resurrection hell in the hot hell, and every 4,000 yojanas further down, there are other hot hells .

There are four ways of reproduction for all living beings: fetus, egg, dampness, and transformation.

Human beings belong to womb birth, hell beings belong to transformation birth.

Hot Hell Hot Hell is like a huge cauldron made of an iron plate. It burns red. All beings are born on this iron plate. Their bodies are huge and soft, like lotus petals.
The hot hell is very, very hot. The fire in hell is tens of thousands of times hotter than the fire in our world. If the hell fire is brought to the Saha world, it can burn Mount Sumeru in a few minutes.

It is recorded in the Buddhist scriptures that Muqianlian once used supernatural powers to bring a little bit of ashes from hot hell back to the human world and put them on the seaside, and the local people could not stand the heat.

240

The hot hell is so hot, but the skin of all beings in hell is as delicate as a baby's skin, very, very sensitive.

When we touch a little fire, it will hurt. The skin of the hell beings is very, very painful when they come into contact with the hell fire. However, their bodies are as big as mountains, and there is nowhere to hide if they want to. Escape; even if you want to die, you can't die, because after death, you will be resurrected instantly and continue to suffer.

You can only continue to suffer until the karma is eliminated, and then you will be reborn elsewhere.

The hot hell is divided into eight hells: the resurrection hell, the black line hell, the impact hell, the howling hell, the howling hell, the fiery hell, the fiery hell, and the endless hell.

The lifespan of beings in hell is very, very long. Among the eight hot hells, the one with the shortest lifespan is the resurrection hell.

According to the Buddhist scriptures, 50 years in the human world is one day for the four heavenly kings, and such thirty days are counted as one month, and twelve months are counted as one year; the lifespan of the four heavenly kings is five hundred years, Then, these five hundred years are counted as one day and night, thirty one day and night are counted as one month, and twelve months are counted as one year. Such five hundred years are the lifespan of the resurrected hell beings.

Converted according to the time unit of the human world, a total of 1620 billion years.

That is, to be tortured in a hot hell for so long before moving to another hell.

241

Moreover, the resurrection hell has the shortest lifespan among the hot hells, that is, the hell that suffers the shortest period of pain. how long the pain will last.

(1) Resurrection Hell The resentment of the living beings in the resurrection hell is very large from birth. The living beings here are just born, and a lot of knives and guns will naturally fall from the air, and then the living beings in the hell will kill each other with these weapons.

Even if all limbs are cut off, they will not Dharmaint; only if their head is cut off, they will Dharmaint for a short time, but they will not die.

At this time, a sound will appear in the air, called the sound of resurrection. With this sound, all beings in hell wake up, their bodies are also resurrected, and they kill each other again.

That's why it's called resurrection hell.

The Book of Friends says:

During this time, three hundred spears were used to pierce the suffering caused by piercing extremely violently.

This is a slight suffering in hell, which is not a metaphor for incapacity and a small amount.

That is to say, if in the human world, if there are 300 people holding spears every day and piercing our bodies continuously for years and months, this kind of pain must be extremely unbearable, but compared with the pain in resurrection hell, But only slightly.

242

Moreover, the resurrection hell is also the hell that suffers the least among the hot hells, and sentient beings will only be temporarily released from the pain when they Dharmaint.

One can imagine how terrifying the suffering of beings in hell is.

(2) Black Line Hell In the Black Line Hell, there are guards such as Ava Bull Head and Yaxia Pig Head. The appearance of the guards follows the karma of all sentient beings.

If sentient beings in hell often kill fish during their lifetime, what they see is the head of a fish; if they often kill sheep, what they see is the head of a sheep, and their body is the appearance of a human being.

These jailers use black thread to draw a lot of lines on the bodies of sentient beings, and then use saws and axes to cut the bodies of sentient beings into pieces according to the lines drawn.

The pieces of meat that were cut into pieces and the blood that flowed out were all painful.

But even so, he will not die or Dharmaint.

We humans will not be like this, the blood that has been shed, the flesh and blood that has been broken, will not feel.

Because all beings in hell are reborn, and their own karma is like this, this is the black line hell.

The sentient beings in the hell below the black line hell, no matter what kind of torture they suffer, they will not Dharmaint or die, they can only endure the pain alive.

243

(3) If you kill too many living beings in hitting hell, you will be reborn in hitting hell.

For example, a person who often kills sheep, when he is reincarnated into hell, will have a lot of huge rocks and iron balls in the shape of a goat like a mountain. After coming out, the internal organs are squeezed out from the mouth and anus. It is very painful. This is hitting hell.

If you were a person who often killed and caught fish during his lifetime, after he fell into the Hell, it would be the iron stone of the image of the fish that would hit him.

(4) Howling hell Howling hell is full of big, red-hot iron plates, and all beings in hell are forced to flee and hide everywhere.

When escaping, you will see a square iron house, and run into the house. As soon as you enter, the iron door will automatically close, and the whole iron house will burn and become even hotter. At this time, there is nowhere to run if you want to run. Can only howl in pain, this is howling hell.

(5) Howling Hell 244

The difference between the Howling Hell and the Howling Hell is that there are two layers of iron houses. After beings escaped into an iron house, they find that there is another layer. Once this layer runs in, the doors of the two layers are all closed, and there is self-karma inside. The existing iron dogs and iron birds come to bite and peck at the eyes, and at the same time, the inside is even hotter, and they are also scorched like fire.

Even if you escape the first floor, you cannot escape the second floor.

The heart is more painful, howling louder, this is howling hell.

The reasons for being born in this hell are: any of the ten unwholesome kamma, and drinking alcohol without restraint. The sutra says:

The drinker is born in the place of howling, the drinker is born in the vicinity.

That is to say, not only those who drink alcohol frequently will be reborn in the screaming hell, but those who often pour and persuade others to drink will also be reborn in the nearby hell, the marginal hell.

(6) Fiery Hell In the fiery hell, there is a huge iron pot. There is red molten iron in the iron pot, which is boiling all the time. All beings are thrown into the iron pot to cook.

Sometimes the red-hot iron rod is inserted from the bottom to the top of the head, burning all over the body, this is the fiery hell.

(7) Blazing Hell 245

All beings are pierced by a three-pronged iron fork from the middle of the body to the top of the head, and two large iron forks on both sides are pierced from the shoulders, just like roast sheep and pigs, and they are grilled on hellfire.

This is fiery hell.

(8) Infinite Hell The sentient beings in the Infinite Hell are burnt red by fire, and they can't tell which is the fire and which are the sentient beings. Only by crying can they tell the difference. This is the Infinite Hell, also called the Avici Hell.

All the sufferings of the above seven hells are added up, and none of them is as great as the suffering of the Uninterrupted Hell.

Uninterrupted means continuous and uninterrupted suffering; or the evil karma of the five uninterrupted sins will go to the endless hell; or life is boundless, that is, between kalpas and kalpas, the lifespan suffers uninterrupted suffering.

If you break the precepts, you will go to hell.

A tantric monk must take the monk's precepts, as well as the bodhisattva vows and the tantric vows, which add up to more than 500 precepts.

To receive various tantric empowerments, one must also uphold more than one hundred precepts.

If you can keep the precepts cleanly, the retribution will be very great; but if you break the precepts, the retribution will be very heavy.

Therefore, we must be clear about how many precepts we have taken and upheld, and we cannot break the precepts.

When you don’t know if you have relapsed your precepts, you should think like this: You are fine now, and you can still repent. If you really don’t survive today, and you go to hell without time to repent, that would be terrifying!

The karma of sentient beings is incredible! Some sentient beings with heavy karma, after eliminating the karma of Avici Hell, will enter the Great Fire Hell, and then enter the Fire Hell.

There are also sentient beings who have to go through all the eight hot hells all over again, which is really boundless suffering.

After the living beings in the marginal hells have eliminated the karma of the hot hells, they will go to the marginal hells to continue to suffer, and some were born in the marginal hells because of their karma from the beginning.
Edge Hell has four levels.

(1) The living beings who have eliminated the karma of the hot hell have to come out of the hot hell and walk through a fire pit mixed with fire and hot ashes, as big as a grassland. The fire of the fire pit will not burn above the knee, but the All of the following will burn to scorch.

Karma is different, and the fire pool that is inspired by karma to manifest is not the same size.

Some sentient beings manifest in fire pits that are hundreds of kilometers, thousands of kilometers, or even longer.

Even if you keep walking, you won't be able to finish it for hundreds or thousands of years, and you won't be liberated.

247

(2) The karma of the stinky corpse mud pond has been eliminated, and the stinky corpse mud pond has to be passed.

A stinky corpse pond is a quagmire that is as big as the sea and full of carrion corpses.

When crossing the mud pond, the corpse mud in the mud pond will drown all the way to the neck, and there are many insects in the mud corpse, all of them come to bite the body, get into the body to suck blood and eat the flesh, the pain is unbearable.

This will take hundreds of years, thousands of years, and the karma is incredible, and it will take tens of thousands of years for those with great karma.

(3) After passing through the stinking corpse mud pond, the sharp blade pond entered the sharp blade pond.

There are three types of sharp edge ponds:

1) Daojiantang Daojiantang is a road full of sharp swords.

After passing the stinky corpse pond, I entered a place that looked like a park. It was full of paths full of swords. I had to walk through it. There was no way to retreat.

248

2) Sword Leaf Forest The Sword Leaf Forest is a large forest with many trees and all the leaves are swords.

The sentient beings passed through the Sword and Sword Pond. As soon as they got here, a strong wind blew, and the sword fell from the tree and plunged into the body, causing unbearable pain.

Likewise, it takes a long time until the karma is exhausted.

3) After the Iron Thorn Forest passes the Sword Leaf Forest, it enters the Iron Thorn Forest.

The iron thorn tree is very beautiful, and all beings will be very happy to see Dharmamily members, relatives and friends all on the tree.

At this time, his Dharmamily asked him to come up. When he went up, all the leaves turned into sharp swords, and the sword's tip was downward. When he climbed, his body was torn apart, and he reached the top like this.

I finally climbed to the top of the tree. Because of my karma, I saw that my Dharmamily and friends were all under the tree again. When I came down from the tree, the sharp blade of the sword turned into a sword that pointed upwards, and penetrated when it went down. The internal organs, the pain is unbearable.

It goes up and down like this, never ending.

In the process of climbing up and down, there are countless iron-billed eagles flying over, pecking their eyes and digging their brains, and there will be groups of iron dogs and ferocious beasts under the trees, rushing to bite and eat.

249

(4) The Boundless River entered the Boundless River after passing through the Iron Thorn Forest.

The Boundless River is a river of salt water that sees no edge and is very dirty.

After passing through the Sword Pond, the Sword Leaf Forest, and the Iron Thorn Forest, all beings were stabbed and chopped with injuries everywhere. These wounds came into contact with the salt water in the boundless river, and the pain was unbearable.

It may take thousands of years to walk the boundless river, depending on the amount of karma of all sentient beings.

After crossing the Boundless River, the karma of going to hell may have disappeared.

At this time, it depends on the amount of good fortune left by sentient beings. If the good fortune is larger, they may be reborn as a poor person or a disabled person; pain.

It is different for those who have studied Buddhism during their lifetime. After the death of a Buddhist practitioner, within seven to seventy-nine days, there will usually be masters and Dharma friends who will recite the sutras for transcendence.

In this way, even if you go to hell, you will be freed quickly.

If our parents pass away, we as children, reciting the scriptures well within forty-nine days will be of great help to our parents, and it is the best way to repay our parents' kindness.

The bardo body that is going to go to hell is black. If the offspring recite more sutras, the bardo body will turn white and will be reborn in the good path.

250

In addition, the three Bodhisattvas, Guanyin, Manjusri, and Vajrapani often go to hell to save sentient beings.

When the bodhisattvas go to hell, all sentient beings who have studied Buddhism in their lifetime will know which bodhisattva is coming as soon as they hear the voice of the mantra of the bodhisattva, and when they think of the bodhisattva, they can be liberated from the hell immediately.

The beings in hell who have not studied Buddhism are not so lucky. Because of their karma, they cannot see the Bodhisattva at all, or the Bodhisattva they see is a ferocious and terrifying appearance, which will make them even more afraid and suffering.

However, it also eliminated a lot of karma.

The cold hell The cold hell is directly north of the hot hell. It is an overlapping structure. The layers are separated by 2,000 yojanas. Hell, Blue Lotus Hell, Red Lotus Hell, Great Red Lotus Hell.
In the cold hell, there is no light such as sunlight, it is dark, and you can't see your fingers. The ground is full of ice cubes, and the wind and snow are mixed.

The lifespan of beings in the cold hell is half that of the corresponding hot hell, that is to say, the lifespan of the rash body hell is half that of the resurrection hell, and the lifespan of the Dahonglian hell is half the lifespan of the uninterrupted hell.

251

(1) Bleeding Body Hell Among the cold hells, the one with the least degree of suffering is the Brackishing Body Hell. The living beings here are so cold that many chilblains and rashes appear on their bodies, and they are like this all their lives.

That's why it's called rash body hell.

(2) The sore body hell is the hell where the sores on the body are so cold that they are all cracked open.

(3) Aqu Hell Aqu Hell is even more severe, so cold that it is impossible to speak, and can only make the sound of "Aqu Aqu".

(4) Whispering hell Whispering hell, the cold is even more intensified, and even "Aqu" cannot be called out, only a "squeaky" sound can be made from the Adam's apple.

That's why it's called wailing hell.

(5) In the gnashing hell In the gnashing hell, the cold is even worse, no sound can be made, only the sound of the gnashing of teeth can be heard.

252

(6) The body of Qinglian Hell freezes into a blue-blue color and splits like a green lotus, so it is called Qinglian Hell.

(7) The cold of the red lotus hell intensifies, the skin freezes into purple red, the body cracks even more, and it cracks into the shape of a hundred-petaled red lotus, which is the red lotus hell.

(8) The Great Red Lotus Hell The Great Red Lotus Hell is a hell that freezes until the whole body turns purple, and the body splits like a thousand-petaled red lotus, so it is also called the Thousand Layers of Red Lotus Hell.

Thousand layers of red lotus is the body frozen into more than a thousand pieces, some living beings even cracked tens of thousands of pieces, all the internal organs are cracked, and the head, eyes, hands and feet are all cracked.

But even so, you can only suffer alive, not die, not even Dharmaint, you can only say that the karma is incredible.

This is cold hell.

The main reason for falling into the cold hell is stubbornness in clinging to wrong views.

253

For example, denying cause and effect and not believing in reincarnation are relatively large and serious wrong views.

In addition, taking away the clothes offered by Buddha statues, or robbing other people's clothes, let others freeze, or even freeze to death; intentionally freeze small animals to death, etc., will also be born in the cold hell.

Scattered Hell Scattered Hell is distributed in the world.
Some sentient beings in the desert, without food or drink, are grilled by hot moxibustion every day, but they will not die; there are also sentient beings who are born in rocks, and sometimes when they mine mountains, they will find frogs, spiders and other animals in the hard rocks. Belong to fragmented hell.

In the past, a few people in our place threw a stone. After the stone cracked, a hole was found, and a large spider was found in the hole. The circumference of the hole was very smooth, you can see it, and I don't know how many years it has been inside.

There are frogs and even mice in the rocks found in some places.

These do not belong to the animal realm, they are scattered hells with animal appearances, and there are also many such scattered hells in the human world.

The above has roughly talked about the suffering of beings in hell. The actual suffering of beings in hell is indescribable with words and ink. It is endless and boundless suffering.

254

When thinking of the suffering of beings in hell, we should also ask ourselves, will we go to hell in the future?

At this time, a strong sense of fear will gradually arise.

Fear of falling into the lower realms is one of the reasons for taking refuge in the Three Jewels. Those who believe in cause and effect will not be afraid.

In winter, if we take off our clothes outside, we won’t be able to stand it overnight. The sentient beings in the cold hell will be frozen for hundreds of millions or tens of billions of years, and we can’t die if we want to.

Good luck can also commit suicide, go to hell, and don't even have the chance to commit suicide.

Therefore, when we think of sentient beings in hell, we need to show compassion and often recite "May all sentient beings be free from suffering and the causes of suffering." Moreover, it is easier to arouse compassion at this time.

Master Bodova said that from hell liberation to human realm, compared with our human realm, becoming a Buddha is very easy, and liberating from hell to a human is millions of times more difficult.

Master Zhongdunba also said that people today are like pulling a big iron ball to the top of the mountain, and it has been pulled halfway.

Because sentient beings will continue to do karma in the process of suffering in hell, for example, when their body is burned, hurt by jailers or other sentient beings, they will generate anger.

If you continue to create karma, you will continue to suffer, not to mention liberation from hell to the human realm, and liberation to the animal realm is very, very difficult.

255

(2) Five hundred yojanas below the ground of Zhanbuzhou, Kunan, in the realm of hungry ghosts, there is a city of hungry ghosts called Jepila. There is no grass, no dripping water, and the ground is like iron heated by the sun.

There is the place where all beings in the realm of hungry ghosts are reborn.

The common cause of falling into the realm of hungry ghosts is miserliness.

If a person is reluctant to give up anything, he may fall into the realm of hungry ghosts in the next life.

Or stealing the benefits of the Sangha; or deliberately not giving people enough food, they will fall into the realm of hungry ghosts.

These are common causes, and there are others.

All beings in the realm of hungry ghosts are womb-born, and a hungry ghost can have hundreds of children.

The belly of a hungry ghost is very large, like a hill, and its head is as small as an egg. Compared with the body, the neck is like a thin grass, the mouth is as big as the eye of a needle, and the limbs are very small, like the leaves of auspicious grass.

The karma of beings in the realm of hungry ghosts is inconceivable. Although they are very thirsty and hungry, they cannot find food and drink. If they can obtain pure bhikkhus’ saliva or excrement, it will be a great reward.

Since I haven't eaten or drank for decades or hundreds of years, my whole body is dry and without water.

Withered skin is covered with withered bones, like dead wood wrapped in dry leather.

When walking, the joints collide with each other, making a cracking sound and rubbing against each other.

256

Hungry ghosts have all kinds of suffering.

Often unable to find food, it is the pain of extreme hunger and thirst; to walk a long, long way is the pain of exhaustion and disappointment; to be driven out and slashed by other ghost kings is the pain of extreme fear.

When the summer is hot, even the moon is very hot, and the moonlight burns to death; when the winter is cold, the sun is very cold.

Hungry ghosts are further divided into three types: hungry ghosts with external obstacles, hungry ghosts with internal obstacles, and hungry ghosts with internal and external obstacles.

Hungry ghosts with external obstacles cannot find or see external things or food due to karma. Such hungry ghosts are hungry ghosts with external obstacles.
For example, looking for water to drink, hungry ghost beings with external obstacles, or can't see water, can't find water; or can't see water nearby, only see water in a very distance, usually a big river thousands of miles away. If you want to drink water, you have to keep walking, because the limbs are very small and the walking is very slow, and it takes decades to walk.

I finally got there, but because of karma, I couldn't see it again, or when I arrived, I found that the water was gone again.

There are others where the water turns into thick blood as soon as you get there, the kind of blood that makes you want to vomit as soon as you see it.

If you are not afraid, even if it is thick blood, you have to drink it, but at this time, you will find that there are sentient beings watching over there, such as some earth gods, evil ghosts, and demons, holding swords and guarding the water, and when hungry ghosts arrive at the water He was driven away, and his body was cut, and his limbs were cut off.

257

I really can't find anything, and I can only eat myself in the end.

Eat your own flesh and drink your own blood.

Hungry ghosts with internal obstructions Hungry ghosts with internal obstructions can see food and get food, but when they eat it, they turn into fire; or when they eat, they turn into feces and other very dirty things.
Such a hungry ghost is an internal obstacle hungry ghost.

The ghost fires we often talk about are not the ghosts setting fires, but generally the food found by the hungry ghosts in the internal obstacles turns into fire.

Sometimes on a night when no one is there, a light is lit, and it is gone for a few minutes.

Often it is a little bit here, a little bit there, and disappears after a while.

We often saw it when we were children, and now we occasionally see it in the countryside or in the wild, and this is generally the case.

Hungry Ghosts of Internal and External Obstacles 258
I couldn't find anything to eat, and even if I found it, it was blocked by the huge Adam's apple, and I couldn't swallow it.

Or even if the mouth eats in, the stomach will not be full.

Such a hungry ghost is a hungry ghost of internal and external obstacles.

All beings in the ghost realm also belong to the realm of hungry ghosts, and the realm of hungry ghosts discussed here is different from the realm of ghosts.

Beings in the ghost realm live in the human world, and their appearance is our human appearance, but it is not the appearance of a previous life, but a different appearance inspired by karma.

Beings in the ghost realm have some supernatural powers, they can see their past lives, know their past lives, and they can also transform into past lives; in terms of food and drink, they can only get the alms of chasing cigarette offerings, others can see, but they can’t. arrive.

We should always think about whether we also have the karma of falling into the realm of hungry ghosts: if we are stingy and steal things, we will all lead to falling into the realm of hungry ghosts.

Some people keep animals, and if they don’t give them food or drink, they will also fall into the realm of hungry ghosts; some people’s parents are old, and their children do not cook or take care of them, and eventually their parents starve to death. There are many such things in society today. , the future generations will fall into the realm of hungry ghosts.

There is a Dharmamily with five boys. A few decades ago, it was very difficult for everyone. With five boys in the Dharmamily, eating was a big problem. You can imagine how difficult it is to raise five boys.

When these five boys grew up, they became five big bosses. As a result, the mothers of the five big bosses starved to death. In this case, if

259

If these five sons do not fall into hell in the next life, 100% will fall into the realm of hungry ghosts.

(3) The bitter animal path of the animal path is also known as the side path. It is stated in the "Yogi's Divinity · Local Points":

"Live with people and heaven, and have no other place to live", which means that the animal life lives together with people and all living beings in the heavenly way, and it is widely distributed.

The animal realm can be divided into the animal realm of the human world and the animal realm of the ocean.

In the "Kusha Theory", it is said that the fundamental dwelling place of the animal life is the sea, and there are more sentient beings in the sea than in the human world, and the sentient beings of the animal world flow out from the ocean. Short lifespan is uncertain.

Animals have common suffering, namely, ignorance, lack of food, fear, helplessness, and the strong prey on the weak.

Ignorance, ignorance, ignorance, and no wisdom.
For example, other beings want to kill or harm it, but it doesn't know.

When the candle was lit, many flying insects flew over, and they did not know that they would be burned by the fire.

There is no such basic discernment and wisdom, let alone one who can learn Buddha's liberation.

260

Lack of food is always a lack of something to eat.
Usually, all living beings starve to death, especially wild animals.

There are also people who are not short of food, because the karma and blessings are different, such as pets.

Beings in the animal realm are in fear every day.
Fear of people and other animals.

For example, the little rabbit among animals, if we walk gently over it, it will run away immediately.

Even if it is sleeping, it will notice and run away.

This is how all living beings in the animal realm have a sense of fear at all times, and are in fear.

When sentient beings in the animal realm are killed, there is often no one to help and protect them, and they are always helpless.
261

The weak and the strong kill each other, the strong devour the weak, and the weak bite the strong.
The above briefly talked about the suffering of all beings in the animal way.

falling into the realm of animals is easy to happen.

If you disrespect the Dharma and the Dharma master, you will fall into the animal realm; if you use animal names to scold your friends, you will fall into the animal realm; if you are disgusted and make fun of the monks, for example, a monk is as agile as a monkey, and he thinks nothing of it, the next life will become Monkey; make fun of monks as loyal as dogs, and they will become dogs in the next life.

Moreover, after falling into the animal realm, they will be reborn continuously, and after death they will be reborn in the animal realm, usually hundreds of times in a row.

We think about ourselves, have we ever scolded monks? scolded parents? Cursed your benefactor? If you think about it, you will find that there will definitely be some. These are all causes of falling into the evil realm and the animal realm, and you must repent.

Right now, we don’t have that kind of immersive feeling in our hearts. If we really become a dog or a pig, what kind of feeling will we feel, so we are not so afraid in our hearts.

When Translator Geruo was alive, there were many inhumans in Tibet. There was a kind of inhuman called Chaman. Chaman looked human on the outside, but in fact it was a kind of inhuman.

262

Once, a female Chaman was knitting yarn on the roof. At that time, there was a small stone hanging under the tools for knitting the yarn. The stone fell. pick it up.

This scene was seen by her son, and he was surprised, and he secretly paid attention to his mother.

In the middle of the night, he saw his mother fly away on a big box, and fly back when it was almost dawn.

The next night, he hid in the box ahead of time. When the box flew, Cha Man noticed that there was something wrong with the box, it seemed to be heavy.

The box flew somewhere, and there were many Chamans here, and everyone made offerings from the corpses in the tombs.

After she was done, the female Chaman sat on the big box and flew home again. On the way back, she knew that her son was hiding in the box. With a blow on his head, her son turned into a dog.

After her son turned into a dog, he was in great pain and ran around, hoping someone would save him.

Once, he ran in front of Master Langri Tangba. The master had supernatural powers, saw it, and said to him: "Tomorrow, a group of people will go to see the translator Geruo. You can follow them, and the translator Geruo can save you."

The next day he followed, and when he arrived at Interpreter Gérault, Translator Gérault knew about the child's situation, prepared Doma, removed his spell, and turned back into a human.

263

What pain is it to be a dog? He felt that even if he went to hell, he would not have such great pain. He wanted to speak, but he couldn't say anything, and he wanted to eat something that no one would give him.

264

Section 3 Refuge This part is about taking refuge.

There are two kinds of refuges. Southern Buddhism and Chinese Buddhism are three refuges, and Tibetan Buddhism is a double practice of esoteric and esoteric practice. Therefore, we are talking about four refuges.

1. Those who take refuge in the Three Jewels of the Three Evil Paths, no matter which path one falls into, one will suffer a lot of pain. If one thinks deeply about these sufferings, a fear will arise.

Think again: in the face of the fear of falling into the lower realms, who can save us? Only the Guru Three Jewels! If we go to hell, the Buddha can save us, this is the Buddha's treasure; the Dharma friend can recite the sutras to save us, it is the Dharma treasure; the Bodhisattva can save us, it is the Sangha's treasure.

Therefore, to take refuge in the Three Jewels, from this moment onwards, the heart of taking refuge in the Three Jewels arises.

There are two basic reasons for taking refuge in the Three Jewels: one is the fear of the three evil realms; the other is the confidence in the Three Jewels.

These two reasons are the reason for the conversion of the lower clergy, and they are also the fundamental reasons for conversion.

Only when these two causes are possessed can one truly take refuge and truly enter into Buddhism.

These two reasons are the minimum conditions for entering Buddhism.

265

Some people take refuge in the Three Jewels because of illness, while others take refuge because they are broke, and take refuge in order to live a long life.

Being able to take refuge in the Three Jewels is a good thing, and you can get the blessings of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas, but these are not the real motivation of taking refuge.

Many people who study Buddhism, after studying Buddhism for a long time, feel that they still have many obstacles and problems. Why? It is because the heart has not yet truly taken refuge, only verbally taking refuge, that is, following the guru to recite the Four Refuge texts, thinking that this is the way to take refuge, but there is no real fear of the evil realms and confidence in the Three Jewels.

If you have the intention of taking refuge in the mortal way, and truly take refuge in the Three Jewels of the Guru, you will definitely receive more powerful and Dharmast blessings from the Three Jewels! Karma and troubles will also decrease rapidly.

The reason for the conversion of the zhongshi Tao is the fear of the six realms of reincarnation.

Not only is there a fear of falling into the evil realm, but there is also a fear of the suffering of the human realm and the realm of heaven.

Then think about it again: in the suffering of the six realms of reincarnation, only the guru, the Three Jewels, can save us.

Believing in the Three Jewels of the Guru is the second reason for the zhongshi Tao to take refuge.

The reason for taking refuge in Shangshi Tao is that they cannot bear the suffering of all beings in the six realms of reincarnation.

The six realms of samsara have gross suffering and subtle suffering.

At the time of the middle priesthood, there was only a fear of gross pains, and in the high priesthood, there was also a fear of the most subtle pains.

266

When the sages are on the way, they are afraid of the pain caused by the obstacles of knowledge. They realize that the only one who can save all living beings and can break the obstacles of their own knowledge is the guru, the Three Jewels.

This is the reason for the refuge of the sages.

The real refuge is to learn, through learning, to understand the cause of refuge, the object of refuge, the amount of refuge, the virtues and benefits of refuge after refuge.

After understanding these six aspects, we can understand what refuge is.

The most basic real conversion we are talking about now refers to the conversion of the lower clergy.

There are two reasons for taking refuge, one is to take refuge because of the fear of falling into the lower realms; the other is to take refuge because of the faith in the guru and the Three Jewels.

The object of taking refuge is the guru and the Three Jewels. Let's look at other aspects.

2. Refuge Amount of Refuge There are four kinds of Refuge Quantity: taking refuge after knowing the merits and virtues of the Three Jewels, taking refuge when knowing the difference between the Three Jewels, taking refuge in the Three Jewels and keeping oaths different, and not taking refuge in any object other than the Three Jewels.

(1) Knowing the merits of the Three Jewels and taking refuge After understanding the merits of the Three Jewels, taking refuge in the Three Jewels means knowing the merits of the Three Jewels and taking refuge.

First of all, we must understand why we take refuge in the guru, why we take refuge in the guru and the Three Jewels.

Why do we take refuge in the guru? What are the virtues of a guru? What are the virtues of the Three Jewels? We have already talked about the merits of the guru. The guru is the representative of the Three Jewels, and we want to obtain the blessings of the Buddhas and Tathagatas, the blessings of the Three Jewels.

However, all the Buddhas and Tathagatas are first integrated into the guru. Only through the guru can they bless us. This is a contingent origin between the master and the apprentice. Even many masters are the incarnations of the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas, so they must take refuge in the guru.

Then, let's look at the merits of the Three Jewels.

Buddha's merits Buddhas have inconceivable merits of body, speech and mind.
(1) Buddha's body merits The Buddha's dharma form, simply speaking, is the Buddha's body.

The appearance of the Buddha is very solemn. When the Buddha is teaching the sutras, some people look at it without blinking. After he has finished teaching the sutras, they still look at it, and even a hundred years of reading is not enough. The Buddha has such physical merit.

The Buddha has thirty-two appearances and eighty sublime appearances.

"Xiang" means that the owner is a man, and "good" is a symbol of inner merit.

268

If you can constantly think about the good qualities of the Buddha's appearance and the causes of the good qualities of the Buddha's appearance, the practice will be more blessed.

Nagarjuna Bodhisattva said in the "Middle View of Jewelry" when he talked about the good qualities of the Buddha:

If you add up the merits of the Solitary Arhats, the Shravakas, and the endless merits of the world, and then multiply by ten times, you can only achieve one "pore shape" of the Buddha's body; One hundred times, one kind of "good" can be achieved; one hundred times of all the eighty kinds of good merits can be achieved; one kind of "sign" can be achieved; one thousand times of all the thirty-two kinds of blessings can be achieved of the Buddha's "Bai Hao appearance"; only one hundred thousand times the blessing of the white hair appearance can achieve the "top bun appearance" of the Buddha; only one thousand times the blessing of the top bun appearance can achieve the blessing of "Buddha language and Sanskrit sound".

In addition, the various parts of the Buddha's appearance and goodness have the function of preaching the Dharma.

The top bun and pores have the function of mind, which can clearly see deep and wide all dharmas.

Therefore, the body of the Buddha pervades all knowledge, and the words of the Buddha and the mind of the Buddha pervade at the same time.

In the "Inconceivable Sutra on the Secrets of the Tathagata", it says:

Wisdom is everywhere, and the body is like a foot.

269

Therefore, it is said that all worlds are reflected in the Buddha's body, and the Buddha's body pervades all the worlds.

The secret of the Buddha's body is inconceivable.

For example, the Buddha's top bun looks only four fingers high when looking up, but the real height is immeasurable.

In the "Inconceivable Sutra on the Secrets of the Tathagata", it is said that Bodhisattva Holding Li used his supernatural powers to fly up through the boundless worlds, but he was never able to see the top of the Buddha's bun, and finally returned tiredly.

The Buddha's body is a rainbow body with a bright, clean and bright body. The light shines. The "Vinaya Sutra" uses three metaphors to praise the Buddha's body:

add fire to the body;

like ghee full of fire;

Such as lamps in gold.

Every kind of light emitted by the Buddha's body can mature and liberate countless sentient beings; in front of every living being, the Buddha can transform into a body that he can accept, and speak in a language he can understand.

In addition, when people see the Buddha body, they will have the idea of ​​wanting to obtain the Buddha body, and they will pursue and accumulate the merits of becoming the Buddha body, which is also a kind of career merit of the Buddha body.

The Buddha's clothes are always separated from the body by four fingers, but people who come to worship the Buddha can clearly see the outline of the Buddha's body; the Buddha's feet do not touch the ground, but can clearly leave a pattern with the Dharmalun on the ground. footprint.

270

If the ants and other sentient beings happened to enter the Buddha's feet while the Buddha was walking, they would be immersed in great happiness for seven days and then reborn in the heavenly realm.

"Yuzan" praises the Buddha's physical virtues:

With a dignified and dignified body, with a wonderful eye and dew,

Like the cloudless autumn sky, the stars are solemn.

Nengren is golden, the dharma robes are strictly covered,

It is equivalent to the top of the golden mountain, bound by the clouds.

Respected parents without strict ornaments, the face wheel is extremely full,

The full moon wheel from the cloud is also incomparable.

The wonderful lotus in the mouth, and the lotus opened with the sun,

Bee sees doubts and agrees, turning it like a rope.

The mask is golden, the teeth are white,

Like the pure autumn moonlight, shining into the golden mountain gap.

The right hand should be offered for the special decoration of the wheel,

Soothing with hands, life and death are terrifying.

When Nengren marches, his feet are like wonderful lotuses,

How can the lotus garden be beautiful on this land?

(2) The merits of Buddha's speech 271

The Buddha has sixty-four speech qualities.

Master Tsongkhapa said on the basis of the Treasure Accumulation Sutra: The Essence of Truth:

All sentient beings in the world ask doubts in one moment,

Doing everything in front of each, with solemn body and speech at the same time,

Although business interests are different.

When Buddha Shakyamuni preached the sutras, if you listened to it in front of you, the sound would not be loud; if you listened to it Dharmar away, the sound would not be small, and it sounded the same.

After the disciples hear it, they will feel that every sentence hits their own troubles, and every sentence is useful.

Especially when people of different races listen to the scriptures together, what they hear from the Buddha is the language they are Dharmamiliar with, what the Chinese hear is Chinese, and what the Tibetans hear is Tibetan.

Buddhas can answer different questions asked by people of different roots at the same time, and what everyone hears is the answer to their own question.

Buddha Shakyamuni has such inconceivable qualities of speech.

In "One Hundred and Fifty Praises", when praising the merits of the Buddha's speech, he said:

Guan Zun's face is lovely, from what he heard,

Extremely and elegant voice, such as the moon Wang Ganlu.

Reverence can be quiet, greed is like a rain cloud;

Uprooting the venomous snake is equivalent to the wonderful winged bird;

Destroy the most ignorant, obscured like the sun;

By destroying my slow mountain, it is also waiting for King Kong.

Seeing righteousness without deceit, without Dharmault therefore obeying,

Good affixes are easy to understand, and respectful words are good to say.

The first time I hear the words of the venerable one, I can capture the mind of those who hear it,

If right thinking is next, it will also eliminate all greed and delusion.

To congratulate all lacks, all liberations return,

Today, those who are happy are tired of leaving, and the words of respect are commensurate with each other.

Those who can produce wisdom rejoice, those who can increase wisdom,

Those who can destroy the shadows, these words benefit all living beings.

(3) The Buddha's Intentional Merit Buddha has great compassion, great wisdom, and perfect ability.

1) The Buddha's Compassion, Merit, Great Compassion, and Great Compassion, refers to the Buddha's Compassion and Merit.

The Buddha sees that all living beings in the six realms are equal, and loves every living being, and the Buddha's compassion is different from ours.

"One Hundred and Fifty Praises" says:

All these beings, there is no difference between delusion and bondage,

In order to solve the confusion of sentient beings, respect for a long time as the bondage of sorrow.

273

We ordinary people generally have compassion when we see suffering beings, sometimes with compassion, sometimes without; sometimes our compassion grows and sometimes it decreases.

And because the Buddha has always seen that all living beings are suffering, his great compassion never stops, and he constantly saves all living beings.

2) The wisdom, merit, and virtue of the Buddha The great wisdom is the wisdom, merit and virtue of the Buddha.

All the principles of Dharma, all the principles of dependent arising, all realms, Buddhas can understand.

The wisdom of the Buddha can arise anytime, anywhere, without hindrance.

In "Zan Ying Zan" says:

The World-Honored Dharma of the fallen age, the origin of all species,

Like a sour fruit in the palm of your hand, it is a state of respect for the mind.

All dharmas move and not move, if one or all,

Like the wind in the sky, there is no hindrance in respect.

In the first four sentences, the Buddha sees the causes of dependent origination of all dharmas very clearly, just like looking at the ummara fruit in his hand (a kind of almost transparent fruit produced in India at that time), which is the realm of Buddha's intention.

274

The last four sentences are to say that all dharmas, whether in the world of sentient beings or in the world of objects, when the Buddha's mind observes these things, is like the wind in the sky, without hindrance, fully understood, without the slightest doubt.

This is the merit of the Buddha's will to distinguish, that is, the merit of the Buddha's wisdom.

The merits of the Buddha's mind also include the perfection of the Buddha's ability.

The ability of the Buddha is indescribable and inexhaustible.

For example, the Buddha is everywhere, blessing sentient beings all the time, as long as our pure faith is opened, we can immediately obtain the blessing of the Buddha.

The merits of the Buddha's mind are the most wonderful.

Everyone should know that from the day of taking refuge, Buddhas and Bodhisattvas are by our side, following us like shadows and protecting us.

Whatever pain or trouble we have, the Buddha knows that the Buddha has this kind of wisdom, which is the merit of the Buddha's mind.

Not only does the Buddha have this kind of wisdom, but he also has a great compassion that never diminishes.

Other gods, or Arahants, have limited ability of mind, merit or supernatural powers, and cannot understand all the sufferings of living beings.

For example, after an arahant enters samadhi, he will not know the suffering of all sentient beings; nor will ordinary worldly gods know the suffering of everyone.

If we are in danger and ask for help from ordinary gods in the world, even if he knows, he may not be able to save us.

Even if we have power, we may not be able to save us.

Because ordinary gods do not have great compassion and compassion, only the Buddha who has great compassion, has the ability, and will definitely save us! It is because the Buddha has the most perfect and supreme mind and merit.

275

The Dharma's merits and virtues are the magic weapon that guides us out of the sea of ​​samsara.
It includes the truth of extinction, the five paths and ten places, etc., of seeing the way, the way of cultivation, and so on.

If we think about where the inconceivable merits of Buddhas come from, we can understand that the Dharma has the merits of producing inconceivable merits like Buddhas.

Just as it is said in the "Zhengshe Dharma Sutra": "All Buddhas, World-honored Ones, all boundless and boundless merits arise from the Dharma, receive and practice the Dharma, and are manifested by the Dharma. According to the right law, the law is done.”

What methods do Buddhas generally use to save sentient beings? They mainly use the method of preaching scriptures and teaching the Dharma.

Therefore, in order to deal with the 84,000 afflictions of sentient beings, Buddha Shakyamuni taught 84,000 dharma-doors. Each dharma-door is a method of dealing with afflictions. As long as you study the Buddha hard, your wisdom will become higher and higher. Trouble will be less and less.

Some people say that after studying Buddhism for a period of time, they have no worries when they do not study Buddhism, but after studying Buddhism they have more and more troubles.

Actually, it's not that the afflictions have increased, it's that I didn't recognize these afflictions before. After I learned Buddhism, I realized and observed my afflictions. This is a kind of progress.

276

Knowing that you have so many troubles, and then learning how to deal with them, you will be able to cut off the troubles one by one.

After you cut off your afflictions, you will be truly liberated. At this time, even if the happiness of all beings in the six realms adds up, it cannot compare to the happiness of a liberated person.

The Buddhadharma talks about the methods of getting rid of suffering and attaining happiness, and it also includes the methods of the world.

For things in the world, for example, if we want to get wealth, the Buddhadharma tells us to do more generosity, which is the reason for getting wealth; and then work hard, and then we will definitely be rich.

No matter from the perspective of the world or the world, the benefits of Buddhism to all sentient beings are very, very great.

Because the merits of the Dharma are so extraordinary, we must take refuge in the Dharma.

Sangha's merits Sangha is a Dharma friend who practises with us or drives us to practise. High-level monks are Arahants and Bodhisattvas. Sangha has different qualities at different stages and at different stages of fruition.
For example, the sravaka, who is in the position of adding and practicing the path, can access the Four Nobles and the sixteen signs in a comparable way; in the position of seeing the path, he can realize the emptiness; in the position of practicing the path, he can gradually eliminate the eighty-one kinds of afflictions.

A monk who has attained Arahantship has even greater virtues: he can change objects from more to less; he can display various changes by means of samadhi; he can reach any sentient beings who want to be liberated.

277

Because of the accumulation of resources for hundreds of kalpas, Yuanjue Arhats have a thousand times more merits and virtues than Shravaka Arhats.

The merits of Bodhisattvas are even more incredible. According to the teachings of the Xianzong, to become a Buddha requires the accumulation of three asamkhya kalpas.

A bodhisattva who has cultivated the path of sustenance and added the path of "superiority and understanding" can choose emptiness through listening, thinking, and practice, and obtain the sufficiency of the first asamkhya; a bodhisattva who is in the position of seeing the path can Diligently practise the giving paramitas of the ten paramitas; then, with the continuous deepening of the practice, the bodhisattvas of the second and tenth levels of the path can gradually complete the other nine kinds of paramitas.

To put it simply, the first seven places of the Bodhisattva have completed the merits and virtues of the second asamkhya kalpa.

The merits of Ascendant Bodhisattva can also be subdivided.

The first bodhisattva can obtain twelve hundred kinds of merits in an instant: transform into a hundred incarnations; each incarnation is surrounded by a hundred bodhisattvas; see the birth and death of a hundred kalpas; shake a hundred worlds; enter a hundred kinds of samadhi; see a hundred people Buddha; received the blessing of hundreds of Buddhas; transformed into a hundred Buddha-fields; visited a hundred pure lands; opened a hundred Dharma doors; matured and liberated a hundred sentient beings; lived in the world for a hundred kalpas.

Twelve merits are compared one by one, the second is a thousand, the third is a hundred thousand, the fourth is a hundred kos, the fifth is a thousand kos, the sixth is a hundred thousand kos, and the seventh is a hundred thousand kos. , eight grounds are the number of dust particles in one hundred and three thousand great thousand worlds, nine grounds are the number of dust particles in one million Asamkh worlds, and ten grounds are the number of dust particles in the indescribable and indescribable three thousand great thousand worlds.

278

The above has explained the different qualities of the Sangha. If you need to study and understand the scriptures more, you will feel that as the major scriptures say, the virtues of the Sangha are immeasurable.

We have already understood the merits of the Three Jewels of Buddha, Dharma and Sangha, and we need to think more about the merits of the Three Jewels at ordinary times.

Until I have strong confidence in the merits and abilities of the Guru Three Jewels, realize that only the Three Jewels can save us, and then take refuge in the Three Jewels with this sincere heart of faith.

(2) Knowing the difference between the Three Jewels and taking refuge There are six aspects: the difference in physical nature; the difference in career; the difference in belief and understanding; the difference in practice; the difference in mindfulness; the difference in life and happiness.

Physical Differences 279
The Buddha is the supremely enlightened one, the one who now realizes Bodhi.

Dhamma is the empirical teaching of the enlightened one.

A monk is a practitioner of the law.

Differences in career The Buddha's career is to preach the scriptures and to save sentient beings.
The cause of the Dharma is to make the minds of all sentient beings follow the Dharma, eliminate karmic obstacles, cut off afflictions, and liberate from samsara.

The business of a monk is to be brave and diligent, and to increase all good dharmas.

Belief in understanding difference Buddha is the object of worship and offering.
Dharma is the content of actual practice.

A monk is a good friend and a friend of the Dharma.

Cultivation of differences The cultivation of Buddha is to make offerings and undertakings. Dharmacing the Dharma is to practice the Dharma. To deal with the Sangha is to live in harmony with the Sangha in practice and life.

The difference of mindfulness often recalls the merits of the Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha, and can cultivate the belief and pure confidence in the Three Jewels.

In the "Sutra of the Three Treasures", the difference between reciting the Three Treasures is explained in detail:

280

Respect to all wisdom and wisdom!

Thus the Buddha Bhagavan said: Tathagata, worthy of offerings, fully enlightened, perfect in enlightenment and deeds, virtuous, understanding of the world, unsurpassed, master of masters, masters of heaven and man, Buddha, and Bhagavan.

Such as those who come, it is a stream of blessings, and the roots of goodness are endless.

Forbearance is solemn, blessings and treasures are fundamental, wonderful and good decorations, all forms are covered with flowers, walks are in harmony with each other, and there is no disobedience in sight.

faith is happy, wisdom is incapable of victory, strength is incapable of yielding.

Teachers of sentient beings, Dharmathers of bodhisattvas, kings of saints, merchants of those who go to Nirvana.

Wonderful wisdom is immeasurable, eloquence is difficult to think, speech is pure, voice and sound are beautiful;

Not stained with desires, not stained with various colors, not stained with colorless.

Free from all sufferings, free from all aggregates, not form all realms, protect all places.

Break all knots forever, get rid of heat and vexation, liberate from love and defilement, and become more and more waterfalls.

The wonderful wisdom is perfect; the wonderful wisdom of the Buddhas and World-Honored Ones living in the past, coming, and present; not in Nirvana, but in true reality.

Rest in all sentient beings.

It is for the Tathagata's righteous wisdom and extraordinary merit.

Dharma practitioners say: eloquently preach the holy life.

Good at the beginning, good at the middle, good at the end.

Wise, witty.

Pure, complete, pure and fresh.

Buddha and Bhagavan are good at teaching the law.

Right, no disease, no interruptions in time.

Extremely good at resting, those who see are not empty, and those who are wise have their own internal evidence.

The law is good.

Decided to leave, Great Bodhi.

There is no disobedience, and the achievement is harmonious;

281

Holy monks say: right conduct, right conduct, quality straight conduct, and respectful conduct.

What should be respected, what should be put together.

Purify merit, purify all faiths.

What should be gracious, universal should be gracious.

The Tibetan version of this sutra is very comfortable to read, and it is also very special. We should read it more and often when we have time.

The difference between life and blessings Buddha can grow blessings by relying on one sentient being.
Sangha grows merit by virtue of many sentient beings, and it is only because there are more than four sanghas that they become sangha treasures. Buddha and sangha are said to be sentient beings.

Dharma relies on non-beings, relying on Dharma to grow merit.

Therefore, taking refuge in the Buddha is taking refuge with the heart of offering and reverence; taking refuge in the Dharma is taking refuge in order to make the Dharma arise in one’s heart.

(3) When taking refuge according to the different vows of the Three Jewels, when taking refuge, you must make an oath, and take refuge in accordance with different vows to the Three Jewels:

Take refuge in the Buddha as a teacher of rescue.

Take refuge as the teaching content of liberation up to Nirvana.

282

The monk should take refuge as a Dharma friend and companion in the practice of liberation.

(4) Before taking refuge in any object other than the Three Jewels, there was a wise man who was an outsider. Later, he took refuge in Buddhism and finally became a great achiever.

He wrote a book called "Praise of the Sages", in which he said:

I do not Dharmavor the Buddha, nor do I hate the heretics,

Whoever preaches is reasonable, I believe in.

The wise man compared various aspects of Buddhism and heresy, including the great teacher of Buddhism Shakyamuni Buddha and the patriarch of heresy, as well as their teachings, achievements and so on.

Judging that the Three Jewels of Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha are superior to all outsiders, he finally converted to Buddhism.

From this, we must also understand that only the Buddha and the Three Jewels can free us from the suffering of samsara.

Therefore, we only take refuge in the Three Jewels, the Buddha, and no other outsiders.

In addition, the Buddha is the most supreme, wisdom and merit are the most perfect.

After taking refuge in the Three Jewels, our blessings will be great. If we take refuge in foreigners or other ghosts and gods at this time, they will not be able to bear our blessings and will be very unhappy. Not only will they have no merit, but they may also hinder us.

283

Buddha has cut off the obstacles of knowledge and afflictions, and his wisdom and ability are the most perfect, and there is no defect at all.

Venerable Tudun and the Buddha were contemporaries. He used to be a heretic leader, but later he joined Buddhism and wrote an article praising the Buddha called "Extraordinary Praise". There is a paragraph in it:

I abandon Master Yu and take refuge in the Blessed One,

What is taking refuge in the Buddha, because there is no excess of virtue.

Venerable Tuton, as the leader of the heretics, eventually left the heretics because he felt that the teachings of the heretics did not make sense in many ways.

For example, heretics believe that all things are created by the "Lord", and human beings are also created by the "Lord", so who created the "Lord"? Later, he read the Buddhist scriptures, studied for a long time, and realized that the Buddha's teachings are the most reasonable, the merits are the most perfect, and the realization is the most ultimate, so he took refuge in the Buddha and the Three Jewels.

It is also stated in the "Exalted Praise":

For all foreign Taoists, think like this,

Each of them competed carefully, and my heart became more and more believing in Buddhism.

It is not a pervasive wisdom sect, and its heart is broken by transgressions,

Since his mind is broken and chaotic, he has never seen a Buddha that is inexorable.

Because outsiders cannot access all kinds of wisdom, they lead to all kinds of

284

Wrong concept, after the concept is wrong, you will see things upside down and confused, so you will be wrong when you look at the perfect Buddha. Therefore, Venerable Tudun said that "the mind is broken and chaotic, and it is impossible to see the Buddha without Dharmault."

In addition, in the history of heretics, there are many things of fighting and killing.

Buddhism talks about great compassion and great compassion. Not only can it not kill sentient beings, but it must also generate great love to save sentient beings. This is also an important difference between Buddhism and heretics.

3. After taking refuge, how to learn, practice, and uphold refuge After taking refuge in the Three Jewels, we have entered the Buddhist sect and are true disciples of the Buddha.

From the disciple's point of view, it is very important to understand what should be learned, what should be observed, and what must be strictly forbidden, which is different from before taking refuge.

After taking refuge in the Buddha, because the Buddha is a good teacher and the greatest good teacher, after taking refuge in the Buddha, you should get close to good people and good teachers.

After taking refuge in the Dharma, you must study and cultivate various teachings and proofs. You must keep your mind alert when you hear it, and always be prepared to think of countermeasures and elimination of your troubles.

After taking refuge in the Sangha, you should regard the Sangha treasure as a good friend and helper in your practice, diligently listen and think, diligently cultivate the precepts, concentration, and wisdom, and follow the practice of the Sangha treasure.

285

After taking refuge, you should also pay attention to four aspects: Always pay attention to protecting the six sense organs, not to pay attention to unhealthy things,

So as not to increase the troubles and hinder the study; Take and uphold the corresponding precepts according to your actual situation; You should have compassion for sentient beings and not harm them; Always think about making offerings to the Three Jewels.

(1) Classification of precepts that should be observed after taking refuge in the Three Jewels This part is divided into two aspects, abstinence and precepts.

Abstinence and precepts include three aspects: taking refuge in the Buddha, not ghosts and spirits; taking refuge in the Dharma, without harming sentient beings; taking refuge in the Sangha, and not making evil friends.
This is called forbidden precepts, which is said in the Great Parinirvana Sutra.

(1) Those who have taken refuge in the Buddha, but not ghosts and spirits, "The Great Nirvana Sutra" says: "If you take refuge in the Three Jewels, it is a matter of right and near, and you should never take refuge in other gods and gods."

The difference between heretics and Buddhism has been discussed before, and I understand that only Buddhism has the true Dharma of liberation, which can lead sentient beings to Nirvana.

286

Therefore, after taking refuge in the Buddha, we don’t even take refuge in the great outsiders, not to mention those ordinary ghosts, gods, dragons, and various immortals, snake immortals, python immortals, Huang Da immortals, and local minor gods, etc. Many places offer offerings to these God's habit.

If you often make offerings to these ghosts and gods and pray sincerely, you will unconsciously generate the heart to believe in them, and you will lose your refuge in the Three Jewels.

After taking refuge in the Buddha, relying on the splendor of the Three Jewels, our leisurely human body has already surpassed those ghosts and gods. When some people encounter difficulties, it is very wrong to abandon the blessings of the Three Jewels and ask for the help of ghosts and gods.

For example, the gods of the earth, the gods of great freedom, and the gods of the gods, we cannot take refuge in them, because they have no ability to save us from reincarnation.

The monks do not bow down to worship these worldly gods. The blessings of the monks' precepts are very great, and they cannot bear it.

If we take the five precepts, we should not kneel and worship, they will also be unhappy because they cannot bear this blessing.

However, you can make offerings to these worldly gods, and you can ask them for help in worldly afDharmairs, such as asking them to help heal diseases, make money, and so on.

Everyone must remember that the only one who can save us from the pain of the three evil realms is the Guru, the Three Jewels, and no other ghosts and gods have this ability.

287

For ghosts and gods, if you ask them to help support the cause of Buddhism, it is fine; however, if it is contrary to the principles of Buddhism, do not ask for it.

In addition, after converting to the Buddha, and then converting to the words of ghosts and gods, the original belief has become a different belief, and the different belief is also a new kind of trouble.

(2) After taking refuge in the Dharma, the Dharma does not harm all living beings. The Dharma of Buddhism has great compassion, which is an important difference between Buddhism and heresy.

Buddha Shakyamuni did not enter Nirvana after becoming a Buddha. It was because he had compassion for all beings and preached the Dharma in order to liberate all beings.

It can be said that the fundamental feature of Buddhism is compassion, so after taking refuge in the Dharma, one cannot harm sentient beings.

Don't even have this thought, let alone kill sentient beings.

(3) Those who have taken refuge in Sangha and do not make evil friends from other sects The "evil sectarian friends" here refers to those who will slander the Three Jewels.

Because we have just taken refuge, and our confidence and view of the Three Jewels are not strong enough, at this time, we are more easily influenced by these people.

288

Therefore, unless you really have the ability to measure the other party, you should stay away from these evil friends.

Moreover, evil friends often harm others, and even some evil friends are murderers and terrorists, and such friends are even more unacceptable.

This time I went to Europe to teach the Dharma, and some Catholics invited me to go. They believe in Buddhism and God. We may find it strange. Even so, as long as you keep listening to it, after a long time, you will be absorbed by the Three Treasures. Gradually, you will become pure faith in the Three Jewels.

In any case, there is a difference between those who have faith and those who do not. No matter which religion, they all exhort people to do good things and not to do evil things. This is the same.

However, the right view is different, the understanding of the good deeds and the Dharma are different, and some religions do not think that the evil things we think are evil things.

For example, Brahmanism, the leader of Brahmanism said that the creator of all things is the Great Brahma, and the Great Brahma created all things, so we are the sons of the Great Brahma.

Then, when we steal something, we take what belongs to our Dharmather, and there is no sin for a son to take what belongs to his Dharmather.

But in our Buddhist view, this is not allowed. We talk about cause and effect, and if we create the cause of stealing, there will be evil retribution. This is the difference in right view.

Some people lack discernment in this area, so pay more attention.

289

Before you have the ability to save such evil friends, or even distinguish them, you should stay away from them and not associate with these people for the sake of your own Dharma body and wisdom.

Keeping the precepts is what we should abide by, including three points:
If you have taken refuge in the Buddha, you must respect the Buddha statue.

Once you have taken refuge in the Dharma, you must respect the Dharma.

Once you have taken refuge in the Sangha, you must respect the Sangha.

Beginners of Buddhism are prone to offend these three points, and unknowingly accumulate a lot of bad karma.

(1) Respect for Buddha statues For Buddha statues, whether they are statues or portraits; whether they are gilded or clay sculptures, made of copper, or other materials, all should be respected.

No matter how it looks or feels, there should be no sarcasm or rash remarks.

Or put it in a dirty place, where it is easy to break.

Or mortgage pawns with Buddha statues, make decorative toys and so on.

The Buddha statue should be regarded as a real Buddha, a field of blessing that truly increases our merits.

290

Once, Gombawa invited a statue of Manjushri, took it to Venerable Atisha, and asked Venerable: "Is this statue well made? If it is not bad, you can invite it back." Venerable replied. : "There is nothing wrong with the statue of the Supreme Manjusri, but the workmanship of this statue is average." After that, he raised the statue of Manjushri respectfully on his head.

We should also respect Buddha statues like Venerable Atisha did. If we don’t respect Buddha statues and comment on Buddha statues and pagodas casually, there will be great sins and heavy retribution.

(2) Respecting the Dharma, accepting and upholding the four verses of the Dharma, that is, more than one stanza, should stay away from and cut off all behaviors that are disrespectful to the Dharma.

For example, mortgage and sell the scrolls; put the scrolls on the ground, on the seat, under the armpits, place them in dusty or easy-to-drop places, or put them together with shoes and socks, and cross the scrolls, etc.

In Buddhist scriptures and dharma books, apart from the Hada for offering offerings, nothing else can be placed, not even Buddha statues.

Because when the Buddha was alive, the Buddha also respected the Dharma and made offerings to the Dharma. In monasteries or Buddhist halls, Buddhist scriptures were placed on the Buddha statues to show respect for the Dharma.

Many of us arbitrarily place Buddhist scriptures and Dharma books, whether intentionally or not, these are acts of disrespect to the Dharma, and will feel the result of diminishing wisdom.

291

Kadampa Dade Xarawa said: "I am equal to playing with the Dharma and doing everything, but those who disrespect the Dharma and the Dharma teachers are the cause of bad wisdom..." This means that many times, we don't think about things related to Buddhism and Dharma. They are all casual and casual, but in the final analysis, disrespect for the Dharma and disrespect for the guru is the main cause of bad wisdom.

(3) All monks should be treated equally in respect of the Sangha Treasures, and should be treated equally without distinction.

To the Sangha or the monks, or the ascetic who only has the image of a monk, or the pictures and photos of the monks, it is not allowed to ridicule, criticize, point and comment, and the consequences of disrespecting the Sangha are very heavy.

According to the Sutra of Persuasion to Increase Inspiration and Happiness, even a bhikkhu with a very poor foundation, if we despise him, there will be no liberation for a kalpa.

And such bhikkhus, if they practice according to the Three Ways, can gradually master the teachings, and finally attain the supreme Bodhi.

Therefore, no monks can be taken lightly.

Some people casually comment on the monks' appearance and behavior, and say many things without thinking about it, and unintentionally plant evil causes. This should be noted.

In the past, the Kadampa master Zhongdunpa and the great yogi Shayrawa saw what looked like a broken yellow cloth on a monk's robe on the road. They dared not step on it. , these are what we should learn.

292

In addition, the "Samadhi King Sutra" says: "What kind of karma does one set up, and it should be like this." The Three Jewels are the most profound blessing fields in the world. Therefore, no matter how you respect the Three Jewels, you will feel the respect of all beings to you. , to gain the respect of others.

(2) Practice after taking refuge in the Three Jewels

After taking refuge in the Three Jewels after thinking about the merits and practicing the Dharma, you should always think about the difference in the merits of the Three Jewels and remember them one by one.
Including the difference between the Three Jewels and the outsiders, the difference between the Three Jewels; the difference between the merits of the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Sangha, and the differences in the merits of the Three Jewels that are superior to those of the outsiders.

The point is to be very clear about each difference or merit, and to think about it continuously.

Only by constantly remembering the merits of the Three Jewels and constantly cultivating our heart of taking refuge will our faith in the Three Jewels become stronger and stronger.

Offering to the Three Jewels Practice Method 293
(1) What are the merits of making offerings to the Three Jewels? According to the more extensive explanations in the scriptures, for Buddha statues or Buddha's relics, even with a bouquet of flowers, one can feel the fruit of Nirvana.

The "Guanyin Sutra" says: "In the past, making offerings to countless Buddhas in person is not as great as making offerings to a Buddha statue in the last days.

"The sutra also says: Incense, flowers, lamps, paints, bells, music, umbrellas, covers, banners, and flags, each of which has ten kinds of merit.

For example, by offering flowers, you can feel that the world where the practitioner will be born in the next life is as beautiful as a flower, with a strong body, extraordinary aura, beautiful skin color, and a strange fragrance on the body, and there will be no shortage of wealth.

In short, when making offerings to the Buddha, which one of the six Buddha Dharmaculties you make offerings to, you will feel that your corresponding Dharmaculties are clean, bright, peaceful and wonderful.

It is also said in the sutra that if you offer anything with sincerity, you can feel the fruit of becoming a Buddha.

The book written by Songtsan Gampo, the Tibetan king, describes the merits of making offerings to Buddha statues by citing the words of Manjusri Bodhisattva asking Buddha. Manjusri Bodhisattva asked: After Buddha Nirvana, what are the blessing fields for all living beings.

The Buddha replied: Bhikkhus and Upas, all of you must be aware that after I Nirvana, the offering of my body and image is no different from the field of merit and blessing that I presently offered to me.

There is no reason to be Dharmamiliar.

Only when a Buddha is born can there be a Buddha statue.

294

Although it is a body image, it is my incarnation.

That is to say, after the Buddha's Nirvana, offering offerings to the Buddha's image is no different from the merits of offering offerings to the Buddha's body when the Buddha was alive.

(2) After taking refuge in the Three Jewels, you should think about the kindness of the Three Jewels more, and make offerings to the Three Jewels with the heart of repaying your kindness at all times.

One is to be grateful to the Three Jewels, and the other is to accumulate the merits of liberation and Buddhahood for oneself.

When eating every day, it is best to remember the three treasures of kindness before eating, and recite "Om Ah Hum" three times, and offer the food on the table to the Three Treasures.

Sometimes when everyone eats together, they put their hands together and say something inappropriate, or they can say it silently.

In this way, eating is originally a consumption of blessings, but after making offerings, it will increase the blessings.

(3) Make offerings continuously. You also need to persevere in making offerings, especially when you are not very good at making offerings, or the offerings are relatively poor.

When the Kadampa Dade Puqiongwa made offerings to the Three Jewels, they could only offer spicy herbs at first, but gradually they were able to offer synthetic long incense, and later they were able to offer precious agarwood.

295

It is said that later Master Pu Qiongwa used 22 taels of gold incense every time he prepared incense.

We all have to learn from Master Pu Qiongwa. Even if the offerings are few and bad, as long as we persist in making offerings, we can gradually increase the blessings, get better offerings, and ultimately achieve great blessings.

If you feel that the offerings are not good and don’t make them, you will not be able to accumulate vast blessings, and you will only be a person with low blessings after reincarnation.

(4) When making offerings, you should also pay attention to the starting and meeting goals when making offerings.

The heart must be good and broad.

There must be strong confidence in the Three Treasures, and joy from the heart.

After making offerings with such a mentality, then dedicate the merits and virtues to the supreme Bodhi, not to attain the fruit of man, heaven and Theravada, let alone to focus on worldly afDharmairs, that is, to dedicate to the vastness.

In the "Sutra of Judgment by King Ajatashi", there is a story about a poor girl who gave a lamp and received the prophecy of the Buddha. It shows that even if the offerings are small, but with great intentions, they can still get great results.

One day, when the Buddha was in the Qijaburi Mountain in the country of Luoyueqi, King Ajataset invited the Buddha to have a meal. After the meal, the Buddha returned to the Jihuan Jingshe, and the Dharmamous doctor, the old woman, suggested lighting a lamp for offering to the Buddha.

296

Therefore, King Ajataseth ordered ten thousand oil lamps to be lit from the gate of the palace to the Jihuan Jingshe where the Buddha lived. It was continuous and very spectacular.

At that time, there was a poor girl named Muni. Although she always wanted to make offerings to the Buddha, she was suffering from lack of money.

Using a copper coin from begging, he lit a small oil lamp in front of the Buddha.

The Muni girl knew that the lamp would be extinguished in the middle of the night, so she reverently made a vow to the Buddha: "I wish to be able to do Buddhist deeds in all my lifetimes, and I ask the Buddha to be blessed with this lamp that will not burn out all night."

After dawn, the Buddha asked the Venerable Muggallana to put out the oil lamp.

The Venerable went to the lamp of the Muni girl, and it was extinguished three times, but the lamp could not be extinguished. After the extinction, the light still shone into the sky, illuminating the three thousand worlds.

After seeing it, the Buddha said: "This is the light of the future Buddha. The faith of the Muni girl has eliminated countless kalpas of sin and karma. After another thirty kalpas, her merits and virtues will be perfect, and she should be able to become a Buddha. The sun and the moon are needed, the people are full of great light, and the treasures in the palace are illuminated by the light, like the sky.”

When the Muni girl heard the Buddha's prophecy, she rejoiced in her heart and bowed to the Buddha.

After hearing this, King Ajataseth asked the old woman, "I have done a lot of meritorious deeds, and the Muni girl only lit a lamp, but she was foretold by the Buddha. What is the reason?"

297

The old woman replied: "Although the great king has done many things, his heart is different. The Muni girl has devoted herself to the Buddha because of her vows and devotions, and her heart has already corresponded to the boundless dharma.

Because of her sincerity, the poor girl Muni only lit a lamp and received the prophecy of the Buddha, so she should come to become a Buddha.

From this, it can be seen that the size of merit does not depend on how much you do, but only on whether your intention is sincere and broad!

After educating others to take refuge in the Three Jewels, you already know the merits and benefits of taking refuge. In order to benefit other beings, out of compassion, you should educate others to enter Buddhism and take refuge in the Three Jewels.
Do it as you can, and let it flow.

Before doing anything by relying on the practice of the Three Jewels, you must pray for the blessings of the Three Jewels, which will gradually increase your confidence in the Three Jewels.
For example, it is easy to succeed by making offerings to the seven branches before doing things, and then praying to the Three Jewels.

Wherever you want to go, you must first worship three times in front of the Buddha statue, and then pray, so that wherever you go, it will be very auspicious.

298

The same is true for the lamas in the monastery. When they go Dharmar away, they should go to the Great Sutra Hall of Tuo Le Monastery first. After offering lamps, they make three bows, and then make seven offerings, offer mantras, and pray for a while before leaving. It will go smoothly.

In this way, not only will one's wishes come true, but it will also gradually strengthen the confidence in the Three Jewels, laying a solid foundation for future study.

The practice method of contemplating the benefits of taking refuge In-depth contemplation of the eight merits and benefits of taking refuge mentioned later, and insisting on practicing the four refuges every day will also greatly increase the confidence in the guru and the Three Jewels.

Vows to never give up the practice of taking refuge in the Three Jewels When we thoroughly understand the causes of taking refuge, the merits and benefits of taking refuge, and the various damages of not taking refuge in the guru and the Three Jewels in this life and the next life, we should never give up whatever happens in our hearts. Thoughts of the Three Jewels, and always make vows: as small as joking, as large as losing one's life, and never say anything about giving up and taking refuge.

299

(3) The merits and benefits of taking refuge

Only after truly entering Buddhism and taking refuge are Buddhists, the disciples of the Three Jewels, and those who truly enter Buddhism.
That is to say, from the moment of taking refuge in the Three Jewels, it is possible to begin to receive the blessings of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas.

The blessings of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas originally illuminated the earth like the sun, but before taking refuge, the mind was like hiding in a hole, and the sunshine of the blessings of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas could not shine.

The foundation of good precepts and the foundation of merit precepts is to take refuge, and only after taking refuge can you receive precepts.
If there is only the idea of ​​taking refuge, but there is no refuge, then even the relatively basic five precepts cannot be upheld, much less the merits of taking precepts.

The foundation of the precept of liberation is also taking refuge. If there is no refuge, the merits and virtues of precepts of no liberation, bodhisattva, and tantric vows cannot arise.

After taking refuge in the merits of eliminating karma, the karma will be eliminated every day.
300

After taking refuge, you will become a Buddhist disciple. You will continue to receive the blessings of the Three Jewels of the Guru, and the blessings of Buddhas, Bodhisattvas, and Dharma Protectors. You will always eliminate karmic obstacles. Even if you recite the Buddha’s name of Buddha Shakyamuni once, you can eliminate karmic obstacles for tens of thousands of kalpas. .

After taking refuge in the Three Jewels, the merits and virtues of the Three Jewels are inconceivable, and the blessings obtained are also inconceivable, resulting in immeasurable blessings.
In the Treatise on Receiving Paramita it says:

The blessing of refuge is colored, and the three realms are still narrow.

That is to say, if the merit obtained after taking refuge has a shape, then the space of the three realms cannot be accommodated. The three realms refer to the desire realm, the form realm, and the formless realm.

From this we can see how great the merit is after taking refuge.

The Buddha is the most extraordinary field of blessing. The root of goodness planted with the Buddha as the object, even if the original intention and motivation are not pure, will become the cause of liberation and becoming a Buddha.

The Buddha said in the Great Compassion White Lotus Sutra:

Ananda! As for the good roots born of the Buddha, they will attain the fruit of Nirvana even if they do not want them. I say that they will eventually attain Nirvana. In this way, the Buddha, World-Honored One, is born with a single thought, and the fruit of all their good roots is Nirvana, and I say that they will eventually attain Nirvana. "

301

Here the Buddha said to Venerable Ananda that the roots of goodness planted by the Buddha, even if they did not initially attain the fruit of nirvana, will surely eventually become nirvana.

Therefore, after taking refuge, when making offerings to Buddhas and Bodhisattvas, or after reciting scriptures and practicing the Dharma, when devotion is made, the devotion to bad and unfinished merits and blessings will not circulate at will, and will eventually return to Buddhahood.

For example, in the past, someone in India made offerings to thousands of monks, but after making offerings, he did not know how to return. At this time, when he saw a beautiful elephant in front of him, in India at that time, elephants were very respected animals, and he thought, I want to go back and become an elephant in my next life.

As a result, after his death, because of the great blessings he offered to thousands of monks, he became the mount of Emperor Shitian, a three-headed incense elephant.

This is an example of the wrong devotion, but, even so, the blessing will eventually return to liberate him to become a Buddha.

Our usual devotion is "dedicated merits and virtues to the six realms and sentient beings are free from suffering and attain happiness." This is a very good devotion. All living beings in the six realms are free from suffering and attain happiness, including both Dharmamily members and ourselves. It is very extraordinary. .

Don't be afraid if the devotion is wrong, even if the blessing will turn to the wrong place, after taking refuge, because of the merit of taking refuge, the blessing will still return to the ultimate vow of becoming a Buddha and liberation.

302

If you truly take refuge without falling into the lower realms, the karma of falling into the three lower realms will naturally be eliminated.
If you don’t do bad things after taking refuge, you will definitely be reborn in the Pure Land or get the fruit of human and heaven with the blessing of the Guru’s Three Jewels.

After taking refuge without being disturbed by demons, you will not be obstructed by ghosts and demons, and they will escape with a single thought. The merits of the four refuges are very extraordinary.
Among the Four Refugees, one sentence of taking refuge in the guru means taking refuge in the lineage masters of all dynasties starting from Buddha Shakyamuni, up to the root guru of oneself.

For example, in our lineage, from Buddha Shakyamuni to the present, there are a total of forty-six generations. One sentence of "taking refuge in the guru" means taking refuge in forty-six masters, including the Buddha. Many Buddhas and Bodhisattvas.

Similarly, taking refuge in a Buddha does not mean taking refuge in one or two Buddhas, but taking refuge in all the Buddhas in the ten directions and three times, including a certain Buddha who has a deep relationship with us.

Taking refuge in the Dharma means taking refuge in 84,000 dharmas, including all the teachings and dharmas handed down by the Buddha.

Taking refuge as a monk means taking refuge in all the bodhisattvas and arahants from one place to ten places, as well as the transcendent Dharma protectors, which naturally include the bodhisattvas and Dharma protectors who have a special predestined relationship with us.

303

As soon as we recite the Four Refugees, the Three Jewels will come to rescue us. Those Buddhas, Bodhisattvas and Dharma protectors who are related to us will come in an instant because of their karma.

So, after taking refuge, you will be protected by all these gurus, Buddhas, Bodhisattvas, and Dharma protectors, and you will not suffer any harm.

Doing what you want is easy to succeed, and any wish will be easy to achieve.
After taking refuge, if you always sincerely respect the Three Jewels and ask for their blessings, you can easily succeed in doing things.

Although the degree of confidence is different and the blessings produced are different, the blessings will gradually increase, and doing things will become easier and easier. Therefore, the biggest method of accumulating blessings is to recite the Four Refugees.

The Buddha said in the "Guangzhou Game Sutra": "A person who is blessed can achieve everything."

Venerable Milarepa's previous life, Kadampa's great virtue Chachacha also said: "If you have a normal heart of taking refuge, you will first be rewarded in this life, everything will be successful, and then at the end of your life, you will receive auspicious signs. ."

Quick Achievement 304
Before taking refuge, all aspects of practice are much worse than after taking refuge. Not to mention, there are the same differences as heaven and earth in terms of accumulating merit and eliminating karma. Therefore, after taking refuge, the achievement of studies will be Dharmaster.

For the practice of the Four Refugees, please refer to Treasures of the Dharma Sea II.

305

Section 4 Karma takes refuge in the Three Jewels of the Guru. Although you won't fall into the three evil realms, you still need to respect Karma.

If you don’t respect cause and effect, don’t know how to restrain yourself, and create karma indiscriminately, you will still suffer in the three evil realms.

We always feel that we have studied Buddhism, and we have taken refuge in the Three Jewels of Guru.

I feel that I haven't done much bad things, I seem to be Dharmar away from the evil realm, and I don't worry much about falling into the evil realm.

In fact, this is just an appearance that arises because you do not understand cause and effect, do not understand the essential characteristics of karma, and are not good at observing and thinking.

Whether or not we can fall into the evil path is not up to us, but is determined by our karma.

Our countless past lives have created countless karma, but we don't realize it.

At the time of death, whichever power of good and evil karma is stronger will be triggered by love and grasping among the twelve karma, and then it will flow with karma.

I feel that I haven’t done much bad karma in this life, but if the big bad karma I created in the previous life matured in this life, or the small bad karma has grown into a big bad karma, what should I do?

The size of karma, on the one hand, has something to do with the strength of the motive, Dharmabrication, and results of the karma.

Therefore, what we think of as a small evil can actually become a very large evil karma.

306

For example, when scolding someone, if you endure it for a long time before scolding, you can't hold it anymore, and finally break out, or because of other reasons, you are very angry and have great anger; After I finished, I felt very comfortable again, and felt that I was scolding right.

In this case, the motives, pretense, and results of this scolding were all done very "satisfactorily".

Such a curse, which is just one word: "Go away!", also produces a lot of bad karma.

For another example, there is a mosquito that keeps me awake. I searched for a long time and couldn’t find it. I was very annoyed. I finally saw it. I can sleep."

Such a karma of killing a living is likely to bring us to hell just because of a tiny mosquito.

On the other hand, the growth of wholesome kamma is not as great as we think.

We always feel that we are not bad. It seems that we have done many good deeds, such as releasing living beings, making offerings to the Three Jewels, reciting scriptures, etc. We feel that our good karma should have a lot of karma, but it is not necessarily true.

If you want to grow good karma, in addition to continuing to do good deeds, you must also purify and perfect your intentions, right actions, and devotions every time you do good deeds, so that the accumulated good karma will be great.

307

Now think about our motivation when we do good deeds, not to mention the Bodhicitta of the sages to save all sentient beings, and the renunciation of the middle sages who are disgusted with samsara, and even the lower sages do not have the mind of impermanence of death.

The first thing that comes to mind is usually to hope for wealth, peace, etc. in this life, or to say "return to the great Bodhi", but in my mind I still hope to be rich in this life, all of which are covetous for the happiness of this life. Liberation is not helpful.

"Secret Continuation" says: "Don't be greedy for the results of this life. If you only pin your hopes on this life, it will not benefit the next life, but if you hope for the consummation of the next life, the results of this life will be extensive and abundant."

Master Chung Dunpa asked Venerable Atisha: "If you do your karma for the sake of happiness, benefit, and respect in this life, what is the result of it?"

The Venerable replied: "The reward is to get that."

Then he asked, "What about the future?"

The Venerable said: "Hell, hungry ghosts, beasts!"

The Venerable also said, like plants, if the root is poison, the branches and leaves are poison, and if the root is medicine, the branches and leaves are also medicine.

Therefore, anything that arises from thoughts such as greed, hatred, and delusion in the heart is evil karma, and it is the cause of evil. This is the heart.

The same goes for forward and backward.

When we do good deeds, most of the time we are not very pure.

For example, one is lazy when studying, and when chanting sutras, one is either dozing off or being distracted.

At the end of the line, the devotion to the wish is similar to that of the heart, both of which are to fulfill the wishes of this life.

Therefore, we think that we have done a lot of good karma, but in fact it is not necessarily.

In this way, for the sake of future generations, it is not enough to just ask the Three Jewels for help. You must also listen to the teachings of the Guru and the Three Jewels and do what they say.

In the Collection of Judgments and Sentences it says:

The Buddhas do not wash off sins with water, nor do they remove all sufferings with their hands.

Unless you transfer the evidence to him, the truth of the Dharma will lead to liberation.

It means that the Buddha's compassion is the greatest. If the Buddha can wash away our sins and obstacles with water, or he can rescue us from samsara with his hands, or if the Buddha can give us his fruits, then The Buddha has done this a long time ago, so we don't have to suffer from samsara.

But these are not feasible, the Buddha can only liberate us by preaching the scriptures for us.

Therefore, we must realize that: in order not to fall into the evil path, we must take refuge in the Three Jewels of the Guru; after taking refuge, we must follow the teachings in order to be completely liberated; liberation is the result, and we must eliminate bad karma; in order not to create evil karma, we must deeply believe in cause and effect, we must understand the essential characteristics of karma, so we must learn the law of cause and effect.

1. Recognize cause and effect.

 Everything has a cause and effect.

For example, being able to have a cup of water to drink is because of the blessing of drinking this cup of water, this is the cause.

When someone is scolded or beaten, it is because of karma, because it is their own bad karma in the past. The person who beats and scolds them is fate, and being beaten and scolded is the result.

To respect cause and effect, we must recognize cause and effect, and we must recognize karma.

It is necessary to recognize the four aspects of karma: the inevitability of karma, strong proliferation, non-retribution, and indestructibility.

(1) The inevitability of karmic retribution Nagarjuna Bodhisattva said in the "Bao Ga Lun":

Unwholesome feelings, all sufferings, like these evil realms;

Feeling all pleasures, all living beings are happy.

The general law of cause and effect is that good karma leads to happy fruit, and bad karma leads to bitter fruit.

310

Although the operation of cause and effect is extremely subtle, there is no confusion at all.

What is the inevitability of karma? The inevitability of karma is: Good will be rewarded with good, evil will be rewarded with evil, and the results of good and evil will not be wrong.

If you plant beans, you will never produce wheat; if you plant wheat, you will produce wheat, but you will never produce beans; if you plant poison, you will be poison, and if you plant medicine, it will be medicine.

What kind of karma is done, what kind of fruit is produced.

This is very important: what kind of karma is created, what kind of results are produced.

For example, if we respect others, others will respect us; if we scold others, they will scold us in turn.

Giving will bring wealth; releasing life will bring longevity, because releasing life is to save the lives of other beings, so the result will be longevity; killing life will be short-lived, because killing will damage the lives of other beings, so it will be short-lived; stealing will definitely lead to poverty ; Provocation will be alienated by relatives and friends.

Once you understand the inevitability of karma, you will naturally understand many causal phenomena.

You will understand that your pain is the result of your previous karma.

Therefore, we must face it calmly, and do not generate hatred and cause greater evil karma.

311

(2) Strong proliferation of karma There are six aspects of strong proliferation of karma: strong proliferation of the essence of karma, strong proliferation of intentional consciousness, strong proliferation of karmic objects, and strong proliferation of karma maker's identity Sex, the strong proliferation of karma time, and the strong proliferation of individual good dharmas.

The strong proliferative nature of the essence of karma The strong proliferative nature of the essence of karma is: even a small bad karma, when the retribution comes out, it will grow to a great size, and can harm a person for life after life; a small good karma Karma, when the good fruits appear, the blessings will be immeasurable and boundless.
This is the general law of the nature of cause and effect, just like a small fire that burns up will eventually burn down the entire forest.

For example, King Ashoka, when the Buddha was alive, King Ashoka's previous life was still a child of an ordinary Dharmamily.

One day, the Buddha and Venerable Ananda met this child on the road. He was very happy when he saw the Buddha, but he had nothing to support him, so he grabbed a handful of soil on the ground and offered it to Shakyamuni Buddha as food.

The Buddha said to Venerable Ananda, "Put this soil back in a bowl and apply it to the wall of the lonely garden. This child will be a king who will rule the world in the future.

312

"Later, as the Buddha said, more than two hundred years after the Buddha's extinction, King Ashoka was born and unified India. In the later period of his rule, he spread Buddhism widely and built 84,000 Buddha stupas.

A child just offered a handful of soil to the Buddha, and for such a small act of kindness, the blessing has grown to become a king.

Therefore, good karma is inherently highly proliferative.

Negative karma also grows substantially in nature.

Nagarjuna lived for 600 years. When Nagarjuna was more than 400 years old, there was a king in India called King Lexing, who often did things for Nagarjuna.

He vowed: "How long is Nagarjuna Bodhisattva's lifespan, my lifespan will be as long as Nagarjuna Bodhisattva, and on the day Nagarjuna Bodhisattva passes away, I will also follow the Bodhisattva to die.

"I made a vow to never leave my teacher, and after I made this vow, King Lexing lived for more than a hundred years before he died.

At that time, Nagarjuna Bodhisattva took many precious classics from the Dragon Palace, spread Buddhism widely, and the Buddhadharma became more and more prosperous in the world. The Demon King Bo Xun was extremely uneasy and wanted to destroy the Buddhadharma, so he was reborn as Prince Guli, the son of King Lexing. , In order to gain the throne, every day expects his Dharmather to die.

However, no matter what you do, the king will not die.

Later, his mother said to him: "Your Dharmather vowed to protect Nagarjuna Bodhisattva and live as long as Nagarjuna Bodhisattva. If Nagarjuna Bodhisattva passed away, your Dharmather would not die.

"The prince came to Nagarjuna Bodhisattva and said that he had unfortunately suffered from a disease that requires a human brain to heal, and asked the Bodhisattva to donate his head.

313

Nagarjuna Bodhisattva naturally understood the reason for this, but he thought: "The Buddha has given his body countless times in the past, and now I am in such a situation. In order to save all sentient beings, I should also fulfill his wish." accepted.

So the prince swung his sword and chopped off Nagarjuna's head, but it was like cutting the air, and he couldn't hurt Nagarjuna at all. Nagarjuna told him, "I have completely purified the consequences of weapon damage five hundred lifetimes ago, so the weapon can't hurt me.

However, when I was still an ordinary person, I once mowed auspicious grass and saw a lot of small insects in the grass. I mowed the grass without caring and killed a lot of insects, but the reward has not yet come out.

You gently pull on my neck with auspicious grass, and I will pass away.

"When the prince heard this, he did as Nagarjuna Bodhisattva said, and cut off the bodhisattva's head with auspicious grass. Nagarjuna Bodhisattva passed away and was reborn in the Land of Ultimate Bliss.

Prince Guli was worried that Nagarjuna Bodhisattva's body would recover again, so he threw the Bodhisattva's head a yojana away.

Since Nagarjuna Bodhisattva has gained freedom from the ground, water, fire, and wind, his body and head have turned into two large stones.

The amazing thing is that the distance between the two stones is shortening step by step. When they are closed, Nagarjuna Bodhisattva will re-enter this body and once again promote the Mahayana Middle Way.

314

The strong proliferative nature of karma is so powerful.

In the past life, Nagarjuna Bodhisattva only killed a few small insects, and because he did not repent of this small karma, it brought about such a big result.

Although he is a bodhisattva of high rank, he has passed away because of his previous karma. This is the strong multiplication of the essence of karma.

Shows how terrible the growth of bad karma is.

The strong proliferative nature of the mind-generating consciousness depends on the subjective consciousness. The karma-generating mind or motives are different, and the results are also very different.
If you do a little thing with compassion and bodhicitta, the good retribution will be very, very large. This is good karma. If you do a little thing with great anger, hatred, greed, hatred, and delusion, the retribution will be very large in the future. Bad karma.

In terms of motivation, the growth of good and evil karma is the same.

So it's important to have a heart! This is the strong proliferative nature of the mind-consciousness.

For example, killing a small ant with great greed, hatred and delusion will also be a huge karma.

On the contrary, if there is no greed, hatred, and delusion, even if you accidentally kill a person, it is not a big karma.

For example, there is a pair of mother and son, the mother is working outside the yard, and the son is in the yard. The son does not know that the mother is outside the yard, and throws a stone, which happens to hit the mother's head, and the mother dies.

315

This son has no greed, hatred and delusion, no bad motives or thoughts, so he is a very small karma.

The same is true for the size of the heart.

Giving a dollar to the poor with bodhicitta, the future retribution will be inconceivable, and it may increase to tens of millions or hundreds of millions.

The size of the highly proliferative result of the karma object depends on the karma object.
If the object of karma is one's mentor, parents, or Buddha or Bodhisattva, these are all benefactors.

Parents are the benefactors who nurture ourselves, and teachers, Buddhas and Bodhisattvas are the benefactors who rescue us from samsara, from suffering and attain happiness.

If you do good deeds to these objects, the good reward will be great; if you do evil deeds, the evil reward will be great.

This is the strong proliferation of the objects of karma.

The strong proliferative nature of the identity of the builder Sometimes, the identities of the makers are different, and the size of the retribution is also different.
Those who have not received ordinances, such as those who have just taken refuge but have not yet received ordinances, are compared with those who have received the five precepts. Those who take the five precepts create a little bad karma, and the karma will be very large; on the contrary, if they create a little good karma, The good news is also very big.

316

The retribution of karma is different, and the retribution of those who are ordained is even greater.

Among those who are ordained, the results are also different.

A person who takes the novice precepts, even if he does a little bit of bad karma, will get more bad karma than a person who takes the five precepts. Similarly, if he does a little bit of good karma, the good karma will be greater than those who take the five precepts.

By analogy, those who take the monk ordination are greater than those who take the novice vows, those who take the bodhisattva vows are greater than those who take the monk ordinance, and those who take the tantric vows are greater than those who take the bodhisattva vows.

Ordinary people offer tens of thousands of oil lamps to the Buddha, which is not as great as a pure bhikkhu offering a single oil lamp.

Conversely, the sin of a precept-keeping monk killing an ant with hatred is greater than the sin of an ordinary person killing a human being.

The identities of the makers are different, and the size of the results is also different.

Different identities have different strong proliferation of karma, and this is the strong proliferation of karma creators.

The strong proliferative nature of karmic time is divided into two parts here.
317

(1) The strong proliferative property of the karma hours refers to the proliferative property of the results in the duration of the karma time.

This is easy to understand. Whether it is good karma or bad karma, long-term and continuous karma will definitely result in greater rewards than short-term karma.

(2) The strong proliferative nature of the karma dates. Compared with normal karma, the increase in the results of karma on certain dates is different.

The karma created in ordinary time is different from the karma created in the first and fifteenth day of the new year.

Especially on the fifteenth day, if you kill a living being on the fifteenth day, even if you kill one ant, the karma is the same as killing hundreds of ants.

In addition, the first day of each month is the beginning of the origin of the month. If the origin of the first day of the new year is not good, the whole month will not be very good;

And some other special days:

The day of the Buddha's transformation is from the first to the fifteenth day of the first lunar month.

The Buddha's birthday is on the eighth day of April.

The auspicious day of the Buddha is from the eighth to the fifteenth day of April and the fifteenth day of every month.

The Buddha's reincarnation day, enlightenment day, and death day are April 15th.

The Buddha comes from the thirty-three days on September twenty-two.

On the fourth day of the sixth month, the day when the Buddha first turned the Dharmalun.

The second day of the Buddha turning the Dharmalun is the fifteenth day of the third month.

Tsongkhapa was born and passed away on the twenty-fifth of October.

The auspicious day of Medicine Buddha is the eighth day of every month.

The auspicious days of the Dakini Buddha are on the tenth and twenty-fifth of each month.

The auspicious day of Amitabha Buddha is on the 30th of every month.

...

In general, these are auspicious days, and on these special days, the results of karma are greater than on normal days.

If you do evil, the reward for evil will be great; if you do good, the reward for good will be great.

The strong proliferation of individual good dharmas, some good dharmas have some unique laws, and we must understand and master them.
(1) Strong proliferation in a special period In the age of the end of the Dharma, the merits of taking a certain precept and keeping it for one day are Dharmar better than the merits of keeping the whole precepts and keeping the precepts for a long time in the age of perfection.

(2) Strong proliferation in special regions 319

In the Saha world of the age of the end of the Dharma, the merits and virtues of practicing good deeds for a moment are Dharmar better than the merits and virtues of practicing good deeds in the pure land of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas for many kalpas.

We are now in the Saha world of the end of the Dharma era.

(3) The strong proliferation of special methods In the secret method, there are many convenient methods that can increase merit.

For example, in daily recitation, if you recite the mantra for increasing merit seven times every morning, the merit of that day can be increased by tens of thousands of times.

Recite the rosary blessing mantra seven times, blow the rosary, and recite the rosary once is equivalent to reciting it a hundred times.

Tantra also has special practice methods such as language blessing, and the merits increase even more.

After reciting the blessing, recite the mantra again, and reciting it once is equivalent to reciting it tens of thousands of times; even ordinary conversations will have some merits, and there will be no great retribution when talking about right and wrong.

Merit increasing mantras and blessings are all special ways to increase merit.

The above is the strong proliferation of individual good dharmas.

(3) Non-retribution of karmic retribution If you do not do evil karma, you will not have bad retribution, and if you do not do good karma, you will not have good retribution.

Likewise, there will be no wealth without giving, and there will be no cause for health and longevity without release.

320

"Don't do non-retribution" also reminds us that we must be diligent in studying Buddhism.

Although there will be no evil retribution if we do not do evil karma, who will give us good retribution if we do not do good karma? Patriarchs and great virtues are achieved only through hard practice, and nothing is gained for nothing.

If you don’t work hard, no matter how much blessings Buddhas and Bodhisattvas do, it’s useless. If Bodhi can be given, the Buddha would have given it to all sentient beings long ago.

Therefore, one should diligently practice and sow good causes, so as to reap the corresponding merits.

(4) The incorrupt nature of doing karma means that the karma that has been done will not be eliminated on its own.

Evil karma must be eliminated through repentance and chanting scriptures. Otherwise, the karma will disappear on its own unless the karma comes out and the karma ends.

The same is true of good karma. If you do good deeds, if there is no anger and jealousy, the good karma will not disappear.

Then, what kind of state is the non-degenerate nature of karma?

In the Buddhist scriptures on the retribution of birth and fruit of fate, it says:
The karma created by sentient beings will not be destroyed for a hundred kalpas.

That is to say, the good and bad karma we create will not be destroyed even after a hundred kalpas, until the karma is established, the result will appear.

The combination of karma will bring forth the result.

Good and evil karma is the cause; karma is the factor that is conducive to the maturity of the cause and the resultant result, such as a specific person, thing, environment, condition, etc.

When planting wheat, the seed is the cause; soil, watering, and spraying medicine are the primary and secondary factors.

We all know that seeds must be planted in order to germinate. If the seeds are not planted in the soil, or if they are planted, but not watered, fertilized, or sprayed, the seeds will either not germinate, or will not bear fruit.

The same is true of karma. If there is no condition, the cause will not work. When the condition arrives, the cause and condition are combined, and the result will come out.

The cause of making a fortune is generosity, and the predestined relationship is to encounter a good business or project.

If there is no cause for giving, even if you encounter a good business or project, it is not necessarily a good thing, it may be a disaster.

Because you don't have the reason to get rich, you shouldn't get this blessing, and you may not be able to afford this fate.

Therefore, it is necessary to create more good causes in order to form good karma.

In addition, people who do not have good fortune will ask questions even if they make money. For example, if someone makes money, they have a car accident.

question.

Therefore, you should always do good deeds, accumulate blessings, and accumulate more blessings. In this way, whatever kind of fate you encounter is a good thing, and you can bear it.

The reason for good health is to recite sutras well, to release animals frequently, and not to kill.

The fate is to take medicine, see a doctor in time, and pay more attention in life.

If there is no healthy cause, the health is not good, no matter how good a doctor is, it may not be able to cure it.

The good and bad karma created by the continuous circulation of predestination has not yet arrived. Those who hold a mind-only view believe that it is hidden in the alaya consciousness and will not disappear on its own, but will always wait for the appearance of karma.

The Madhyamika school believes that the nature of karma is that it is not corrupt, that it is not preserved in the alaya consciousness, and that it will not be destroyed.

Yuecheng Bodhisattva said in "Entering the Middle Treatise":

The self-nature of causation is not inherently corrupt, and it is possible to do it without relying on store-consciousness. Some karma has been destroyed over many lifetimes, and its consequences will still be produced.

It means that even if the big karma is destroyed, the small karma remains, after many reincarnations, the retribution will still appear.

323

No matter how much good or bad karma, it will not destroy itself.

We put our palms together in front of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas today. Although it is only a small gesture, no matter how many times we are reincarnated, as long as the condition is met, the result of liberation will be ripe.

There is a way to delay the appearance of bad karma, which is to prevent the karma of bad karma, so as to prolong the germination of the seeds of bad karma and produce results.

It's like putting a seed in a dry place and blocking the connection between water and soil, it won't germinate.

For example, the cause of health is to save the lives of all sentient beings, so we release more animals and have a variety of good causes.

However, we don’t know how much killing karma we have done before. Therefore, in order to delay the evil retribution of illness, we must pay more attention to the conditions that affect our health while planting good causes.

For example, do not eat unclean things, do not go to disease-prone areas, and do not go to places where the soil and water are unacceptable. Take medicine when it is time to take medicine.

Be careful what you do and you won't be unhealthy.

Delaying the appearance of evil retribution will prolong the time of repentance, and finally, karma can only be completely eliminated through repentance.

324

2. The Ten Ways of Karma

 We have already understood the essential characteristics of karma and the importance of cause and effect, but we still do not necessarily understand what is good karma and what is bad karma, because cause and effect are very subtle, so how do we determine in the future Is what you do good karma? According to the "Kusa Lun":

Taking a picture of it is rough, good and bad are as appropriate, and it is said to be the ten ways of karma.

That is to say, the relatively obvious good and bad karma can be summarized into ten types, called the ten karma paths, including the ten good karma and the ten evil karma.

Since our words and deeds in the world are also included in the ten karma, it is necessary to learn and understand the ten karma.

On the other hand, the "Entrance to the Middle" says:

If all the different births and all the words are born, if all the self-reliance and realization of Bodhi, and all the Buddha's sons are determined to win, the reason for the increase of the superior birth is not the remainder.

The ten good deeds in the ten karma are also called the ten good precepts.

The meaning of this verse is: 

For sentient beings, keeping the ten wholesome precepts is the basis for attaining the perfect human body; for Shravakas and Solitary Arhats, it is the basis for attaining the status of Arhat; for Bodhisattvas, it is the Buddha's foundation.

Therefore, learning the ten ways of karma is very important for correctly understanding things and cause and effect, and preventing evil karma.

325

It is also more conducive to cutting off bad karma, eliminating karmic obstacles, and accumulating merit.

The ten good deeds are: no killing, no stealing, no sexual misconduct, no lying, no double tongue, no evil speech, no flattery, no greed, no hatred, and no wrong views.

The opposite of the ten good karma is the ten evil karma, which are: killing, stealing, sexual misconduct, lying, gossip, bad speech, flattery, greed, hatred, and wrong views.

(1) The results of the ten evil karma

Severe killing means killing arahants, Dharmathers and mothers, and killing; 

moderate killings means killing large animals; 

mild killings means killing small animals.


In addition, there is no difference between letting others kill and committing suicide by yourself, and instigating others to kill is more serious.

It is stated in the Kosher:

If the military and other colleagues are colleagues, they are all like authors.

That is to say, like the army, because they have to obey the military orders and kill the enemy together, everyone's killing karma is the same, and even if one kills, the others will have the same retribution.

326

Serious killings will lead to hell, moderate killings will lead to the realm of ghosts, and minor killings will lead to being reborn as beasts or animals.

Even after the karma of the three evil realms is completely eliminated, when you reincarnate as a human being, your body will not be healthy and your life will be short.

Or there are strange diseases, or there are intractable diseases at birth, or even death at birth.

Or the body cannot absorb it, no matter what or how you eat, your body will not improve, you will be afflicted with pain, and medicines will not work, until you die painfully. These are the results of killing.

Some people's retribution of killing can be manifested in this world.

For example, after killing some sentient beings, a man soon had a problem and died unexpectedly in a car accident.

Some people say that this is karma disease, but in fact all diseases are karma disease, the result of karma.

For the pain caused by killing, it is necessary to recite more scriptures, repent, and then see a doctor, which may be effective.

The usual practice in Tibetan areas is to recite the scriptures first, or the Great White Umbrella Mantra, or make a thousand offerings to the Medicine Buddha, and then see a doctor. The effect will be obvious.

The effect of killing also depends on the motive at that time.

Different motives bring different results.

Killing is all because of greed, hatred, and delusion, some are because of greed, such as greed for the flesh, skin, horns, bones, etc. of animals; some are because of anger, hatred, and hatred of certain animals; In order to make offerings to certain gods, many cattle and sheep were killedand sacrificed.

327

In general, no matter what the motivation is, the stronger the motivation, the heavier the consequences.

Without a motive, what leads to the death of sentient beings is not considered killing.

For example, if we don't pay attention when we walk, we trample ants or bugs to death under our feet, which is not considered killing.

The result of not killing is health and longevity, increased blessings, and increased compassion.

So, from now on, let's stop killing.

If you want to avoid killing, you must first have the idea of ​​releasing life in your heart, and make a vow in your heart: "From today, I will treat all beings in the six realms with compassion and not kill any being."

If you do this constantly, your thoughts will gradually change.

The Effect of Stealing: Stealing is stealing what belongs to the Lord.
If it is unowned, it is not considered theft.

Serious theft is stealing the property of the Three Treasures, or stealing valuables; moderate theft is stealing from the poor; petty theft is stealing small money, lack of business, and so on.

The result of stealing is poverty, and one will be poor in every life.

328

Because stealing cuts off the cause of making a fortune, wisdom, conditions and other aspects are the predestined conditions for making a fortune.

If there is no cause, the cause will not work, so there will be poverty.

For example, even though some people work very hard, have good conditions in all aspects of work, and are wise, they are still very poor and have a hard life. This is probably because there is no reason for getting rich, but only because of poverty.

It may be that you stole something in a previous life. If you want to make a fortune in this life, you must first repent of your previous karma, and then do wealth and generosity.

For example, making offerings to the Three Jewels, especially making offerings to the Sangha, the monks of more than four are called Sangha, and the blessings they get are very large. By doing so, they will plant the cause of making money, and they will only make money in the future.

Another consequence of stealing is losing money.

Your own things often disappear for no reason, or your money is stolen or defrauded by others.

The number of thieves in the world increases, the harvest of crops will decrease, and disasters such as drought, frost, and hail will often occur. These are the consequences of stealing.

If you don't steal, it will be easier to get richer.

Therefore, not only should we not steal, but we should also give money regularly.

The best almsgiving is to make offerings to the Three Jewels, and then to help those in need, such as charity and donations.

329

Adultery is the relationship between a man and a woman other than a husband and wife.

Serious adultery will go to hell.

A moderate level of sexual misconduct will fall into the realm of hungry ghosts in future generations. For example, the target of sexual misconduct is someone who has a relationship with him within three generations; or sexual misconduct after marriage; or a husband and wife act in front of a Buddha statue, 

A Buddha statue is not placed in the bedroom. This is the reason.

A small licentiousness will fall into the realm of beasts.

People who are wicked will consume the blessings quickly, and then gradually they will become ugly, ugly, and their bodies will stink; the living environment will be bad and dirty, and there will be a lot of muddy sewage. These are the results of wickedness.

Abstaining from sexual immorality is also called the holy life. Such a person will be very beautiful, the body will naturally emit fragrance, the Dharmamily will be happy, the husband and wife will be harmonious, and the children will be happy.

It will be very fortunate, and after death, it will almost always be reborn in heaven.

The consequence of Dharmalse speech is to speak deceitful words with the motive of greed, hatred, and delusion. The object of the speech is a normal person, and the other party can understand and have normal understanding ability.

330

There are many kinds of lies, and the most serious lies are the teaching of the Law of the Supreme Being.

The Dharma of the Master is to Dharmalsely claim that one has the merits and virtues above the first jhana, and Dharmalsely claim that one has the merits and abilities beyond the world.

For example, if you don’t have the merits of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas at first, but you say that you have such merits, you say that you are a Buddha or Bodhisattva; you don’t have supernatural powers, but you say you have supernatural powers; you are not a living Buddha, but you say that you are a living Buddha; .

These are all big lies, and the result will be hell.

A moderate level of lying is to deceive monks, parents, and benefactors.

There are a lot of small lies, including cheating money, deceiving people, etc., and later generations will also fall into the evil realm.

The result of lying is that there are often liars around, and no one will believe what you say, even if it makes sense, no one will believe it.

They are often wronged. For example, some people who did not commit a crime were framed or even imprisoned. This is the result of lying in a previous life.

Therefore, when we are wronged by others, we must understand that this is a kind of retribution, and think in our hearts: This is the consequence of my previous lies.

When you created karma easily and naturally in the first place, and when the retribution comes out, you should also accept it willingly.

If hatred arises at this time, the results will increase and new negative karma may be created.

331

It is necessary to endure peacefully, and after the retribution is over, the karma will disappear.

The result of not telling lies is that you will be trusted by everyone and praised by others, and you will be very kind.

The consequences of lying is to sow discord.
The more serious duplicity is in the monastery, when talking among the Sangha to instigate dissension, don't underestimate this verbal karma. This kind of karma is very easy to create, so be very careful.

Others sow out the relationship between Dharmamily members.

For example, saying in front of the master, "Master, this disciple is not sincere and unbelieving in you..." to provoke the relationship between the master and the disciple.

Then, he went to the disciple and said, "Your master doesn't care about you, it's not good for you..." to provoke the relationship between the disciple and the master.

The consequences of doing so will be tragic, it will lead to the betrayal of relatives and friends, and when you are old, you will be ignored, your own children will not be cared for, and you will die alone.

You need to be very, very careful about this kind of sowing discord, and it is easy for lay people to create this kind of karma.

The general level of lying is the words that are said between husband and wife and friends to sow discord.

The retribution is to cause relatives and friends to stay away or to fight and discord. People around you cannot live in harmony and choose to live in places with uneven terrain.

332

The result of not talking twice is that you will have more and more friends, and you will be liked by more and more people. Everyone believes in whatever you say, and you will be respected by your Dharmamily and subordinates, and it will be easy to achieve your career.

The consequences of evil speech is to curse people.
If you scold Buddhas, Bodhisattvas and teachers, the result in the next life will be going to hell. This is a very serious slander.

If you scold your parents, it is also a huge karma, and there will be very painful consequences.

In addition, because you have once scolded others, you will also be scolded and hated by others, and your voice will often be hoarse. Chronic pharyngitis is the result of bad words in previous lives.

People who often speak harshly will often accept the harsh words of others, or the strong tone of voice, which is not liked by everyone in the crowd.

Especially when meeting someone who has been scolded by him in a previous life, the two will get bored with each other as soon as they meet, and they will not be pleasing to the eye no matter how they look at it.

Many husbands and wives are at odds, but also because of the reasons they used to speak badly.

People who often speak ill will be born in the next life where there are many rotten wood and thorns.

What's more serious is that when you speak ill, it is easy to generate hatred, create more bad karma, and bring about more serious consequences.

333

Many people have doubts about educating their children, and think that if they don't scold their children, what should they do?

In fact, whether it is a bad word or not, we must pay attention to the thoughts and motives.

The existence of greed, hatred, and delusion in the mind counts as bad karma, and without it, it counts as bad karma.

If you scold your child with hatred, if you hate that iron is not steel, if you hate that your child is not as good as someone else's child, this is bad language, and it will also lead to resentment from the child.

If the parents are not greedy and the children must achieve a certain goal, such as test scores; and if they speak with kindness and are not angry, the children will not resent their parents.

Because the parents’ hearts are good, the message of loving-kindness is passed on to the child, which will make him understand the parents’ hearts.

The result of not saying bad words is that the throat and throat will be healthy, and people will be more liked by everyone.

Because I don't say bad words, it is often easy for others to speak in front of me.

The retribution of eloquent speech is to speak ill of right and wrong, to speak ill of others, to speak ill of this person, and to speak ill of that person.
If there are a lot of slang-speakers in an area, strange things can happen, such as if the tree doesn't bear fruit on time, or ripens at a season when it shouldn't.

334

The consequence of speaking eloquently is that the language expression has no value and does not receive the respect it deserves.

The same words have different effects when spoken by different people. People who don’t speak right and wrong have more influence and prestige, and people will listen to them.

There is a difference between greed and greediness.
"Greediness" is not necessarily bad. For example, we are greedy for rebirth in the Land of Ultimate Bliss, so we often recite Amitabha Buddha; we are greedy for Buddha, so we study Buddhism;

What is greed? A great desire for one's own and other's possessions is greed.

Greed has five characteristics:

There is worry: especially indulging in nostalgia for one's own wealth.

Greedy: Always eager for wealth growth, only accumulation, reluctance to use.

Have a gluttonous heart: deeply envious and coveting the wealth of others.

Scheming: always thinking about how to take possession of other people's wealth.

Veiled mind: the mind is full of greed, without feeling ashamed, and without awakening.

With these five characteristics, it is greed in the ten evil karma.

335

The result of greed is that what you get is not what you want.

If you can't get what you want, you will often encounter people or things you hate.

For example, when someone needs help, he will leave.

When you hate someone, that person will always appear, which is also a terrible karma.

No greed: no greed for other people's property, the result will be wishful thinking.

When you are not greedy, wealth or opportunity will come naturally.

When you are greedy, you will not be able to chase after wealth, and you will not be able to ask for it. Life and career are very hard.

The Retribution of Hatred: Hatred is the greatest negative karma among the ten evil karmas.
Anger means losing your temper and getting angry, and anger can easily eliminate any blessings you have accumulated.

People with great amounts of anger usually go to hell.

For example, if you are angry with a Buddha or Bodhisattva, if you are angry with a Bodhisattva who has come to earth, the blessings accumulated over a hundred kalpas will be eliminated in an instant, and you will go to hell in the next life, and you will stay in hell for a hundred kalpas. If the opponent is a bodhisattva of eight or more lands, the blessings of a thousand kalpas will be eliminated at once, and you will spend a thousand kalpas in hell; if you are angry with ordinary bodhisattvas, the blessings of one kalpa will be eliminated, and you will stay in hell.

Therefore, we must never be angry with Buddhas and Bodhisattvas, because we do not know who Bodhisattvas are, so it is easy to create such bad karma.

336

If you develop anger towards your teacher, you will wipe out all the blessings accumulated over a kalpa.

Being angry with someone who is kind to you, your parents, and your relatives will also wipe out a few years of good fortune.

Even being angry with ordinary people will wipe out the blessings that you have worked so hard to accumulate over a period of time.

In addition to the blessings that have been dedicated and the blessings of emptiness, the general blessings, such as prostration and Buddha recitation, will be eliminated.

Anger not only destroys good fortune, but also leads to internal poison, which leads to aging and ugliness.

Western scientists have studied that when a person is angry, collects his breath and breathes on a mouse, the mouse will die immediately, showing that angry people even have poisonous breath.

A very beautiful person, if he loses his temper every day and always has anger on his face, will easily become ugly and will grow old very quickly. It is because of anger that produces internal poison.

When anger arises, thoughts of harm often arise along with it. For example, when you are angry, you may feel anger in your heart and hope that the other person will die.

Therefore, it will inspire the troubles of being hurt by others, and often feel fear for no reason, always feel that someone is trying to harm you, and it is easy to provoke the hurt of others' anger.

Also, we all know that if someone is angry, the people around them will feel uncomfortable too.

Because there is a kind of energy fluctuation in angry people, and this kind of fluctuation can make others afraid.

When many people lose their temper at the same time, the energy caused by the fluctuation will be very large. If tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of people are constantly angry and resentful, the energy of the fluctuation can almost shake the world.

There are many reasons for causing earthquakes, one of which is because of anger, and the resentment of sentient beings is too much and too heavy.

Earthquakes, fires, hurricanes, wars and plagues are mostly caused by hatred.

There is also a great evil spirit in the fluctuations of anger. The gods of the earth and the world are afraid of this evil spirit. If a person is often angry, these gods will stay away and no longer protect the person.

And it will also attract demons, because demons follow evil qi. Over time, they will create even greater evil karma.

So we must deal with anger, or be able to control it.

First of all, at ordinary times, you should pay attention to the consequences and Dharmaults of anger, and gradually imprint them in your mind and consciousness.

Then you have to remind yourself frequently of things that may make you unhappy, and keep vigilant in your heart.

In this way, if the mood is not good, when the attack is about to occur, immediately grab the emotion that causes anger and control it.


At the beginning, you may have to realize after being angry that you were angry just now.

In fact, this is a good thing. We already have the awareness to catch this emotion, and we have noticed the thief of anger, and we will slowly catch it sooner to suppress the signs of anger.

Not being angry will lead to health and longevity. Nagarjuna Bodhisattva lived for 600 years and never was angry in his life; 

Asanga Bodhisattva lived for 400 years, and Yueshang Bodhisattva lived for more than 350 years, all of which are the result of not being angry.

The Result of Clinging to Wrong Views: Clinging to wrong views is stubbornly clinging to upside-down ideas.
Bad things are considered good, good things are considered bad; things that exist do not exist, and things that do not exist exist.

This is a wrong view, an upside-down notion.

For example, Buddhas and Bodhisattvas do exist, but some people think they do not. Why? They say that they can't see them.

There are many things that our naked eyes have not seen, but it cannot be said that there is nothing just because we do not see it.

The six realms of reincarnation exist, and so do the three worlds of cause and effect. These are invisible to the eyes, but it cannot be said that they do not exist.

Once you have wrong views, everything you do will be wrong.

339

After a person clings to a wrong view, his character will become crooked, he will become more paranoid, he will spend his whole life in the inversion of right and wrong, and he will go to hell in the next life.

In addition to being confused by oneself, it can also affect others, harming oneself and others, but cannot be aware of it.

When there are many people in the world who hold wrong views, water and mineral resources will disappear.

Gold mines and silver mines will gradually disappear, gold will turn into stone, and good things will become bad or disappear. These are the results of clinging to wrong views.

(2) How to Eliminate Karmic Obstacles

In order to respect cause and effect, one must first practice the ten good precepts.

If the Ten Wholesome Precepts are not cultivated well, there will be many obstacles in the practice, and there will be even greater and more karmic obstacles in the next life.

When we think about the contents of the ten evil karmas, we will know how many karmas we have violated and how much karma we have created.

Once karma is created, we must deal with it. We use the Four Forces to Eliminate Karma to get rid of our negative karma.

The four powers are the power of reliance, the power to give up, the power to get rid of evil, and the power to counteract.

The power of reliance: The power of reliance is to take refuge and generate bodhicitta. This is the power of reliance.

After taking refuge, many karmic obstacles will naturally be eliminated, and the same is true of bodhicitta, which is called the power of reliance.

What they rely on is the power to eliminate karma, the power of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas.

Abandoning power: 

Abandoning power is a feeling of remorse for the karma you have created.
For example, repent in your heart: "I did a lot of bad things in the past, but now I regret it, and I won't do it again in the future.

"With a repentant heart, a lot of karma will naturally be eliminated.

To be free from evil forces is to be free from evil karma.
For example, vowing: "From today onwards, I will no longer commit this kind of bad deed."

This kind of firm determination is to be free from evil forces.

Studying the Buddhadharma, reciting the Buddha, reciting mantras, chanting sutras, and repenting are all the countermeasures for karma.
If the karma is not dealt with in time, the karma will grow rapidly.

Therefore, every night we have to repent of the karma we created that day. If we do not repent, the karma will increase by an equal amount.

341

For example, if one kills one ant today, but does not repent before going to bed at night, tomorrow will become the karma of killing two ants, four the day after tomorrow, eight the day after tomorrow, and sixteen the next day. In this way, after five days, there will be to kill thirty-two ants.

The karma multiplies every day, which is terrifying.

Therefore, every day before going to bed, we should recite thirty-five Buddha repentance texts, or twenty-one hundred-syllable mantras to prevent the growth of karma.

If you learn the Vajrasattva repentance method, and you can think and visualize rationally, and then recite the hundred-syllable mantra 100,000 times, all karmic obstacles can be eliminated.

This is to use the power of antidote to deal with karmic obstacles. Buddhism has many methods of repenting of sins.

Use the above four powers to eliminate karma, no matter how big the karma is, it can be eliminated.

Once upon a time, there was a man named Zhigao (Yangguli Mara or Yanggu Mara), and he believed very much in a pagan master.

The master said to him, "I teach you a very special secret mantra, but it takes the thumbs of a thousand living people to make rosary beads."

He believed it.

Then he grabbed people everywhere and chopped off other people's thumbs. A total of 999 thumbs were chopped off, and many people died at the same time.

Finally, when he was only a thumb away, he saw Shakyamuni Buddha, and he kept chasing after him. The Buddha seemed to be walking slowly, step by step, and his fingers could not catch up with all his strength.

Later, the Buddha stopped and put his finger in front of the Buddha. He wanted the Buddha's thumb. Buddha Shakyamuni asked, "What do you want to do?" He said, "My master wants to teach me a mantra, which requires a rosary made of the thumbs of a thousand living people."

The Buddha said: "You are ignorant of the good teacher, this is an evil teacher, you must stay away from him.

You have killed nine hundred and ninety-nine people like this and chopped off their thumbs, what a sin! After hearing this, Zhigao regretted it, converted to Buddhism, and repented before Shakyamuni Buddha. After a few years, his karma was eliminated and he attained the fruit of Arahantship.

When Venerable Milarepa was a child, his Dharmather died, his uncle and aunt seized his Dharmamily's property and made him, his mother and sister work for them as servants.

His mother often said to him, "I heard that there is a Bon religion in Tibet. You go to learn some skills and come back and curse them. If you don't go, I will hang myself in front of you."

Milarepa went to Bon to teach the method of curse.

After returning, on the wedding day of his uncle's eldest son, Milarepa chanted a curse, thunder exploded in the air, hailstorms fell, houses collapsed, and thirty-five people and horses were killed.

This is a very serious killing. Later, Milarepa eliminated this karma through ascetic practice and repentance.

Therefore, no matter how great the negative karma is, it can be eliminated through repentance.

343

At the same time of repentance, if you recite sutras and practice diligently, these karmic obstacles will be eliminated Dharmaster.

Not only do we have to eliminate great negative karma, but even the smallest karma must be completely eliminated, and we must repent and clean up.

Otherwise, even after hundreds of years and hundreds of kalpas, there will still be retribution.

After the seeds of karma have been exhausted, there will be no retribution.

344

Section 5: If a human being can respect cause and effect, he will not fall into the three evil realms.

However, we not only want to avoid falling into the evil realms and obtain the fruits of humans and heaven, but also to obtain the precious human body.

Among the people who are full of leisure, the one who is most conducive to the practice of Buddhism is the one with the eight virtues. The eight virtues will be Dharmaster and more powerful in the practice of liberation.

A person with the eight virtues includes the following eight aspects:

1. Longevity and long-life of the human body can make the practice time more abundant, and it is more certain to liberate.

When propagating the Dharma to benefit living beings, it can also benefit more sentient beings.

2. When practitioners practice the bodhisattva way to save sentient beings, the appearance of dignity has a certain effect.

Nagarjuna Bodhisattva lived for six hundred years. From the age of one hundred and twenty, his appearance changed to that of a sixteen-year-old boy. He had similar appearances to the Buddha's thirty-two and eighty-sixty appearances. It was very dignified.

When Nagarjuna Bodhisattva taught the Prajna Sutra, very few people could understand it, but there were many people who went to see Nagarjuna Bodhisattva.

After meeting Nagarjuna Bodhisattva, everyone made a vow to be like Nagarjuna Bodhisattva, to be liberated and become a Buddha or become a Bodhisattva. In this way, many people have been saved.

3. Born as an aristocrat: In modern society, there is no noble title, but there are still people who are rich, kind, and the three treasures of pure faith.

If you are born in such a Dharmamily, there will be fewer obstacles to learning Buddhism.

4. Wealth and popularity: people with wealth and popularity will have a an easier time  of doing good deeds and practicing.

5. Possess morality. To speak virtue is to say that the words are convincing, appealing and influential.

Everyone will believe and respond.

346

6. If an authoritative person possesses the power that is conducive to the practice of the Dharma, they will be able to gain the freedom to practice the Dharma, and they will also be able to drive more people to practice the Dharma.

7. Men's physical obstacles will be less when they study the Dharma.

Men's and women's troubles are the same, but from a physiological point of view, women's physical troubles will still be a little more, and there will be more feelings and pains. For example, women are going to have children and so on.

In addition, it will be more convenient for men to travel or go in and out of crowds, and they can also live alone in a secluded place to practice the Dharma, and there will be less obstacles or influences in the practice.

8. Possessing power refers to having sufficient and outstanding conditions in various aspects such as body, wisdom, and ability.

The body is strong and healthy, and can endure asceticism like Venerable Milarepa.

If you have enough wisdom, you won't get tired when you practice the Dharma, your mind won't get tired easily, your ability to endure is strong, and it's easier to practice diligently.

347

The above is a precious human body with the eight virtues.

Relying on a human body with the eight virtues to practice the Dharma, it is very comfortable, very happy, relatively relaxed, liberating and attaining Buddhahood Dharmaster.

When the conditions are met, it will be very convenient and easy to forgive others.

348

The sixth section summarizes the path of the mortals. In the path of the mortals, the real practice is the ten virtues and taking refuge.

After completing these two dharmas, later generations will obtain the fruits of humans and heaven.

Besides, it is more important to generate several kinds of thoughts.

**First of all, it is necessary to achieve the rare view of being full of leisure and human beings.**

Only when the concept of the rare human body is born can one truly realize the preciousness of the human body.

Only then will you understand that the human body is like a wish-fulfilling treasure. Relying on the present human body, one can obtain the fruits of humans and heaven, become a Buddha and attain liberation, and even be reborn in the Pure Land.

It is a pity to be able to realize that it is a pity not to practice after obtaining a precious human body! In this way, every time I think of this, my rare and precious human life, I will motivate myself to practice.

Then to achieve the concept of impermanence in life.

When there is no concept of impermanence in life, the practice will sometimes be diligent and sometimes slack.

After realizing the concept of impermanence in life, you will definitely be diligent in practicing the Dharma.

At this time, in the depths of consciousness, a firm belief has been formed, believing that the only thing that will help you when you are dying is the Buddhadharma, and nothing other than the Buddhadharma can help. Anything else cannot be relied upo.

I also understand that people are bound to die, and that when they will die is uncertain, and I don't even know if they can live through today and see tomorrow.

Therefore, we must practice today, and we must diligently practice the Dharma of the Buddha.

349

The next step is to understand the three evil paths of suffering.

First, think carefully about the pain of the three evil realms, and seriously think about how you would feel if you really fell into the evil realms, until a sense of fear arises from the bottom of your heart.

At this time, taking refuge in the Three Jewels is a genuine refuge, and can truly recognize the preciousness of the Three Jewels.

Then continue to think about the vast benefits of taking refuge, such as accumulating blessings, eliminating karmic obstacles, etc., and strengthen your confidence in the Three Jewels.

After sincerely taking refuge, you must also think about believing in cause and effect.

After taking refuge in the Three Jewels of the Guru, although you can temporarily not fall into the evil path, you still need to respect the law of cause and effect, otherwise you will still fall into the evil path.

To respect cause and effect, we must understand the nature of karma.

Through learning and cultivating the ten karma paths, I have come to know the gross good and evil karma, and the results of the ten evil karmas.

Finally, I also learned about the eight meritorious persons who are most suitable for practicing the Dharma.

This is the Lower Path.

When cultivating Shi Dao, after realizing the concept of impermanence in life, if you can realize that even if you get the Fruit of Humanity and Heaven, there will still be the possibility of falling into the evil realm in the next life, and the only way out is to escape from the six realms of reincarnation.

At this time, the idea of ​​​​seeking liberation will arise in the heart, and in this way, one will enter the way of the Middle Way.
