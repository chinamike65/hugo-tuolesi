#### Introduction to Ngawang Gyatso Vajra Guru

Master Ngawang Gyatso was born on March 3, 1969 (the fifteenth day of the first lunar month) in Hainan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Qinghai Province.

The master began to practice Buddhism as a novice monk at the age of six, and became an ordained monk at the age of eighteen. He studied with Dharma Master Lama Yong Zeng, Geshe Rinpoche, Lobsang Dorje Vajra Guru, Gejia Rinpoche, Dharma Master Yeshe Gyatso, Gazang Qusong Vajra Guru and the 10th Panchen Lama.

Master Ah Wang, having followed the precepts of his teachers, received complete transmission of the teachings from his seven masters, the forty-sixth generational heirs of the "Perfection of Wisdom Sutra", the most important classic of Buddhism. From them he obtained more than 200 kinds of empowerments, more than 300 advanced special empowerments, more than 280 guiding precepts, with more than 500 scriptural sutras and more than 80 oral transmissions of intangible secrets. Therefore, the lineage of the master's doctrinal transmission is extremely complete and especially rare.

His Holiness Dharma Master Yongzeng, who was once the sutra teacher of the living Buddha, Sechi, in Lamodeqin Monastery was a person of superior virtue and the complete holder of the transmissions of the Gelugpa tantric teachings. Master Ah Wang studied with Master Yongzeng for more than 20 years and absorbed all of the wisdom and experience of the Venerable Dharma Master. The other six masters are also highly proficient in the esoteric secrets and have sufficient evidence of exceptional scholarly achievements. 

In addition, Master Ah Wang studied at Qinghai Buddhist College and the Ta'er (Kumbum) Monastery Debating College of Dialectics (Debating College).
With a single-minded commitment to study and wide erudition, he completed the study of sutra and tantra, the five major theories of the five great Dharma masters, well ahead of schedule.

Since graduating from Qinghai Buddhist Academy and Ta'er Monastery Debating Academy with excellent grades, the master has been living at Qinghai Tuole Monastery, serving as the Vajra Guru and the abbot of the monastery. He teaches the monks of Tuole Monastery every day in groups: lectures on the five traditional monastic subjects, the "Three Principal Aspects of the Path", and the four classes of tantra, and has set up a new sutra debating school at the monastery.

Master Ah Wang has now produced several batches of lamas with a Geshe degree (equivalent to a Ph.D. in Buddhism).

The master also insists on going into retreat for two months every year.

Lama Yongzeng once told Master Ah Wang: "Your whole career in this life is to turn the wheel of Dharma widely and spread the Dharma for the benefit of all living beings."

Master Ah Wang often gives sermons, teachings, lectures, and holds empowerment ceremonies in both Tibetan and Chinese areas, and often holds patriotic teachings, and patriotic activities in monasteries, making due contributions to the promotion of social harmony and stable development.

At the invitation of believers from other places, the master has travelled all over the world to teach the sutras and the Dharma to those who are destined to hear them.

In 2009 and 2014, invited by the Buddhist community in Macau, the master, as a representative of Tibetan Buddhist monks, presided over the Puja for the 10th and 15th anniversary of Macau's return to the mainland.

In October 2015, the master was also invited to participate in the 2015 Chongsheng International Forum co-organized by the Yunnan Buddhist Association and the Dali Chongsheng Temple.

Master Ngawang is not only perfect in his practice and perfect in his eloquence, but he is also the author of a rich collection of writings.

The Master's writings include Commentary on Philosophy, Commentary on the Diamond Sutra, Dictation from the Three Masters of the Three Paths and Three Schools, Vajrasattva Ritual and Practice, and Dakini Mother of Buddha Ritual, Tracks and Practical Practices, Practice of Retreat, Simmering Sang Ritual, Biography of Vajra Guru Gazang Qusong, History of Tibetan Buddhism, Dabao Motto, Nectar Dharma Rain, Tantric Buddhism Feng Shui and the "Dharma Ocean Treasures" series (this is the third volume), etc.

The master's writings are concise and comprehensive, and the analysis is profound and thorough, and has been praised and acclaimed by many great scholars in Buddhist circles at home and abroad.

Master Ah Wang once studied under the 10th Panchen Lama, who is deeply loved by the people. The Panchen Lama was called "a great patriot and an outstanding leader of Tibetan Buddhism" by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and made many important contributions to Buddhism in China.

Master Ah Wang was deeply influenced by the Panchen Lama. In his religious thought, he advocated that Buddhist disciples should be concerned with the common people, cherish the "Three Great Loves" and practice the "Four Practices" in order to achieve the harmony and perfection of the "Five Vows".

"Three Loves": patriotism, love for the people, and love for education.

"Four Practices": take self-purification as the foundation, take altruism as the principle, take harmony as the spirit, and take enlightenment as the goal.

"Five Wishes": Great social harmony, great national unity, great national prosperity, great world peace, great perfection in practice.

Under the leadership of Master Ah Wang, the Sangha of Tuole Monastery adheres to the rule of the Gelug School. The results are among the best. Master Ah Wang said that it does not matter if we are talking about Southern Buddhism, Chinese Buddhism or Tibetan Buddhism, they are all Buddha's Dharma, and they are all very special.

Buddhists should go deeper into the scriptures, diligently study and think, and establish a right view. At the same time, it is necessary to develop Bodhicitta widely and truly think for the sake of all sentient beings, in order to achieve a perfect life for oneself and others.


**San Shi Dao - Three Principal Aspects of the Path**

![三士道](/images/sanshidaoshang.png)

The third of the series "Treasures of the Dharma Ocean" from Tuole Monastery

Three Principal Aspects of the Path (Part 1 - Lower Scope)

Ngawang Gyatso Vajra Guru begins:

I pay homage to the Great Masters and all the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas!

Thank you Master! 

He worked hard to explain the "Three Principal Aspects of the Path", and personally guided the proof-reading of the book, benefiting all sentient beings. Thanks to the teacher's instructions, I wrote this preface with sincerity and admiration.

I would like to share with fellow practitioners the experience of proof-reading and studying "Three Principal Aspects of the Path" over the past year. Please forgive me for any parts which may seem incomprehensible or difficult to understand.

In order to save all sentient beings, the Buddha preached 84,000 Dharma Doors, the core of which is the sequence of the Bodhi path. The order of the path is either manifest or hidden, and has always been hidden in the scriptures.

The sequence of Stages of the Path taught by Buddha Shakyamuni is "The Prajna Paramita Sutra", and the sequence of Stages taught by Maitreya Bodhisattva is "The Ornament for Clear Realization". 

Great Bodhisattvas such as Nagarjuna and Asanga, as the lineage masters of the sequence of Stages, have all been followers of the sequence of Stages. 

**The successive biography of books and essays**

It was not until Venerable Atisha's "The Lamp for the Path to Enlightenment" that the order of the path to enlightenment was clearly stated, and it was not until Master Tsongkhapa's "The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path to Enlightenment" that the steps of the path were explained clearly.

Countless practitioners have achieved success according to the stages of the path to enlightenment, and they have also become a part of learning according to the stages of the path. However, "The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path to Enlightenment" is very terse and difficult to understand, especially for beginners.

**The study characteristics of Gelugpa**

The compassionate master, taking into account the difficulties of all living beings in their studies, explained to us the essence of the path to enlightenment - "The Three Principal Aspects of the Path".

The "The Three Principal Aspects of the Path" explained by the master focuses on the basics. In terms of content, it is mainly founded on the teachings of the predecessors of the Gelug School and the sages of the Kadam School. The front and back sections of the whole book explain and supplement each other.

In teaching the Dharma, the master cultivated profound and extensive knowledge, and adopted a comprehensive teaching method, including Yin and Ming, which was used when explaining the five traditional monastic subjects. The logic is rigorous and clear.

On the whole, in "The Three Principal Aspects of the Path", the master uses vivid and concise language and interesting allusions to describe how an ordinary person must follow a clear path from attaining perfection in the world, to liberation and becoming a Buddha.

The Path of the Lower Scope mainly talks about the impermanence of life, the suffering of the three evil realms, taking refuge, knowing about cause and effect, and Liberation from the cycle of samsara. The Path of the Middle Scope talks about bodhicitta, the ten perfections, and the four **captures**, with the goal of attaining Buddhahood.

The cultivation of the three aspects of lower, middle, and upper scopes are the stages that every practitioner must go through. Buddhas and Bodhisattvas have come this way, and so have patriarchs and great virtuous masters.

The master also said that the lower path is the foundation and the most difficult part to practice. After crossing the lower path and understanding the stages of the path to enlightenment, you will clearly know which stage you are at.

The direction will become clearer.

Right now, we need to know what to practice, how to practice, to what extent, and how long it will take, along with what to practice in the next stage.

What materials need to be prepared, etc., are all clearly explained.

When reading other classics, it also has a strong guiding significance. It enables practitioners to determine which part of the Dharma a sutra belongs to, whether it is suitable for practice at the current stage, and so on. It is of great help to the study, and it has swept away the confusion in the minds of many students, and made their confidence in the Guru and the Three Jewels more firm.

"The Three Principal Aspects of the Path" is not only a teaching of the Buddha, but also has a strong guiding significance for life in this world. The book tells us: To truly cherish oneself and one's life, is to cherish the human body and develop oneself earnestly; if you want to be prosperous and healthy, you must not steal or kill, you must give more, release more living animals, and repent of mistakes. If you have prestige and good fortune, you must not create bad karma and strive to make all living beings happy.

In every respect, it varies.

It can be said to be the best guide book on life in this world.

The master understands the suffering of sentient beings too well, and his words directly point to the minds of the people.

During the proof-reading period, I often remembered the master's explanation in the middle of the night, even in my dreams, and I couldn't settle down to sleep for a long time.

The teacher's words are like a simple and powerful old hoe, and every sentence creates a furrow on one's heart that has been blinded by ignorance for a long time.

Thinking about the first half of my life, I didn’t know how to distinguish between good and bad karma, I was dazed and didn’t know the direction, and I lived a life of confusion of right and wrong.

Fortunately, when you are lucky enough to meet the teacher, then you just have to wake up.

From now on, just by listening to the teacher's words, being an honest person, steadfastly studying, and benefiting sentient beings, can the meaning of life continue to increase, and only then can one be worthy of the three jewels, of the teacher and one's own life.

The "Three Principal Aspects of the Path" published this time was compiled by many disciples of Tuo Le Shenzhen Center, based on video materials of teachings by the master in Hong Kong and Lishui in recent years, over a period of two years.

In the process of sorting out the materials, the master also expanded a lot of content according to the actual situation of modern people's practice of Buddhism.

In particular, more detailed explanations and supplements have been made for the relatively brief parts in the "Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path of Enlightenment ".

For example, the section on **"Approaching the Good Men"** in the "Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path of Enlightenment " has only 15 pages (Guanghua Temple edition of "The Path to Enlightenment"), and the text is difficult to understand. A detailed explanation is given.

It can be said that this edition of "The Three Principal Aspects of the Path" is the most comprehensive, thorough and easy-to-understand book among all the books that explain the correct sequence for teaching and learning the Dharma.

I repeatedly emphasized that the sooner the "The Three Principal Aspects of the Path" is published, the sooner it will benefit all sentient beings!

Therefore, I often proof-read with my disciples until very late at night, and started proof-reading again early the next day.

In June 2014, due to overwork, I felt unwell. Afterwards, at the strong request of the Hong Kong disciples, I went to Hong Kong for a physical examination and adjusted my medication for half a year.

The master hopes that the vast number of Buddhist students can correctly understand the essence of the Buddha's Dharma and have a strong desire for the Buddha's teaching, get out of the misunderstanding of non-sequential and blind practice, and diligently study and reflect on the path to enlightenment, and practice diligently according to the three scopes, in order to realize enlightenment as soon as possible!

Bow down, thank you, Master!

Thanks to Nie Dolma and all the brothers who participated in the proof-reading!

Disciple Sanjay was established

##### Chapter 1 - Lineage of the Paths

Now I will tell you about the Three Principal Aspects of the Path and the Stages of the Path to Enlightenment.

First of all, we must understand the meaning of "Stages of the Path to Enlightenment".

Bodhi means enlightenment, cutting off refers to the removal of afflictions and obstacles to knowledge; Enlightenment means the realization of emptiness, and also has the meaning of awareness; The Way refers to the Three Aspects, which are the Lower, Middle, and Upper Scopes. The order is the sequence, the procedure.

The Buddha's teachings are comprised 84,000 Dharma gates or doors, and what the Three Aspects teach is the correct sequence of the "Stages of the Path of Enlightenment".

To talk about the "Stages of the Path of Enlightenment", we must talk about the "Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path of Enlightenment" by Je Tsongkhapa.

The Dharma of Buddhism is inherited from the pure and perfect Buddha, and the sequence of the paths was also passed down by Shakyamuni Buddha himself.

Once you understand the teaching of the order of the Path, when you study the sutras in the future, you will realize that: all Buddhist scriptures teach the order of the Path.

Buddha Shakyamuni preached the "Prajna Paramita Sutra" at Vulture Peak. After the Chinese translation of the "Prajna Paramita Sutra", there are 600 volumes, including the entire content of 84,000 dharmas, and it is the most important Buddhist scripture.

The "Prajna Paramita Sutra" explicitly teaches the profound order of the Path, while the hidden meaning teaches the vast order of the Path.

The very deep Path sequence was passed on to Manjushri by the Buddha, and Manjushri passed it on to Nagarjuna, and later formed the deep insight sect **Dao** sequence; the vast **Dao** sequence was passed on by the Buddha to Maitreya Bodhisattva. He created Maitreya's Five Sutras, also known as the Five Dharmas of Maitreya, such as the "Abhisamaya-alaṅkāra sutra", as a teaching of the path to enlightenment, and passed it on to Asanga Bodhisattva. Later, the path of the Guangxing School was formed.

In this way, in ancient India, two different lineages, deep insight and broad practice, were formed.

The Deep Insight School teaches the right view of emptiness, and the Guangxing School talks about the convenient method.

Only by learning and cultivating the two methods of wisdom, right view and skilfull means, can one be liberated and become a Buddha. Just like the two wings of a bird, both are required.

Before Venerable Atisha, the deep and broad paths were inherited separately.

The lineage of the Profound View School passes from Manjushri to Nagarjuna, Nagarjuna to Candrakirti, Candrakirti Bodhisattva to **Dazhengli Rhododendron, and Dazhengli Rhododendron to Xiaozhengli Rhododendron.**

The Guangxing School view was passed on from Maitreya Bodhisattva to Asanga Bodhisattva. At first, Asanga Bodhisattva went into retreat for 12 years. After 12 years, he met Maitreya Bodhisattva. Maitreya Bodhisattva brought Asanga Bodhisattva to Tusita Heaven and passed on the Five Dharmas of Maitreya.

Asanga Bodhisattva passed on the lineage of the Guangxing School to Vasubandhu Bodhisattva, who was Asanga Bodhisattva's half-brother.

Vasubandhu Bodhisattva passed it on to the Vimuktisena, and gradually spread to the **great and small Gusa Li** and Master Dharmakirti.

Venerable Atisha got the lineage of Profound View from **Xiaozhengli Dujuan** and the lineage of the Guangxing School from Master Dharmakirti.

Venerable Atisha also received the lineage of the Dorje Chang / Vajradhara of the Practice Blessing School. Shakyamuni Buddha incarnated as Vajradhara and passed it on to Tilopa, Tilopa passed it on to Naropa, Naropa passed it on to **Zhububa, Jububa** then passed it on to Venerable Atisha.

At the same time, Venerable Atisha also received the transmission of the lineage of Shantideva Bodhisattva's "A Guide to the Bodhisattva's Way of Life" by Manjushri.

In this way, the Venerable Atisha received the complete transmission and teaching of sutra and tantra, and gained access to all of the Dharma.

On this basis, Venerable Atisha wrote the famous "Lamp for the Path to Enlightenment", which captures all the essentials of the Dharma, and the phrase "Stages of the Path" has been around since then.

The "Lamp for the Path to Enlightenment" has really opened up a path that an ordinary person can follow and become a Buddha in his present life in a turbid world. It is very, very special!

Later, other sects in Tibet also formed their own schools based on the "Lamp for the Path to Enlightenment", benefiting countless people and laying the foundation for the establishment of the Kadam School.

7

Venerable Atisha passed the "Lamp for the Path to Enlightenment" to Master Dromtönpa. At that time, the Atisha passed it to him in secret, and Dromtönpa, unable to understand, asked, **"Why did Atisha teach the secrets to others? The mantra, and teach me the order of the path?"** The Venerable Atisha replied, "Besides you, I have not found anyone to whom can entrust this Dharma!" This shows the importance and splendour of the "Lamp for the Path to Enlightenment", and it also indicates that it is the origin of the saying that Master Dromtönpa will spread the Dharma and benefit life in the future.

Later, Master Dromtönpa founded Radreng / Reting Monastery, established a Kadam School, spread the Dharma, and guided the practice according to the teachings of "Lamp for the Path to Enlightenment". Many people have achieved enlightenment through this.

After the establishment of the Kadam School, Master Dromtönpa passed the "Lamp for the Path to Enlightenment" to Gombawa, and Gombawa passed it on to Yeshiba, and Yeshiba passed on Tamaba and Jechenpo, forming the Kadam School.

Dromtönpa also passed on the order of the path to Shi Owa, who passed on to Chayuwa, and later formed the order of the path of the **Kadam Professor School.**

Master Tsongkhapa received the lineages of these two schools from the great siddhi of Lodha, Namkha Gyaltsen. Master Namkha Gyaltsen was very accomplished and had received these deep teachings from Vajrapani Bodhisattva himself.

In addition, Master Tsongkhapa also obtained the lineage of the Kadampa school from the Dharma Khenpo Dharma Protector of Tsaku Monastery, which was passed on by Dromtönpa to Potoba, and from Potoba to Sharawa.

8

The three schools were gradually developed and formed according to the broad strategy of study and the ability of later disciples.

To put it simply, the Kadampa scriptures are based on the practices of various great scriptures and explain the order of the path, similar to the combination of the five great treatises and the steps of the path now, and has the highest requirements for the wisdom and diligence of the disciples.

The sect explains the order of the path in accordance with the "Stages of the Holy Dharma" by Master Zhuolongpa, which is slightly simpler than the previous sect, similar to the current study in accordance with the broad and abbreviated theory of the path to enlightenment, and the requirements for the disciples are slightly lower; The Kadampa masters explain the order of the path, highlight the main points, and at the same time employ various brief guiding principles to guide the disciples to study and practice, and the requirements for the disciples were the lowest.

In this way, Master Tsongkhapa obtained all the lineage of the lower, middle and upper stages of the Bodhi path, and wrote the "The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path to Enlightenment" based on "Lamp for the Path to Enlightenment".

"A Lamp for the Path to Enlightenment" provides a high-level summary of the teachings and demonstrations of Buddhism. It is very concise and only contains a few pages.

"The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path of Enlightenment" explains the theory of the "Lamp for the Path to Enlightenment" in a deeper and broader way, which is wide, profound and easy to understand. For those who find the "Lamp for the Path to Enlightenment" difficult to understand, the "Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path of Enlightenment" explains it very clearly .

In Tibet, the Tibetan version of "Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path of Enlightenment " can be understood a lot by an ordinary person, such as a nomadic shepherds; an arhat with high wisdom will also find it profound, subtle and inconceivable when he reads it. "The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path of Enlightenment"  is very, very special.

#### Chapter 2 - the peculiarity of the order of the path 

mentions the three aspects, the order of the path of enlightenment, and the "Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path of Enlightenment", so it is inevitable to mention Master Tsongkhapa. 

So, what kind of person is Master Tsongkhapa?

**Section 1**

Master Tsongkhapa was born on the twenty-fifth day of the tenth year of the Tibetan calendar in 1357 in Huangzhong County, Qinghai Province. Because the place of birth is called "Tsongkha" in Tibetan, he is honored as Tsongkhapa, which means born in Tsongkha.

Master Tsongkhapa is the founder of the Gelug School of Tibetan Buddhism and the wisdom reincarnation of Manjushri. 

Maitreya Bodhisattva once said: 

"The incarnation of Manjushri, 

like the eyes and heart of all Buddhas and Bodhisattvas, 

will appear in the world."

11

Master Tsongkhapa's father often recited "Manjushri's True Name Sutra". Before the birth of the master, he dreamt of a great virtue, saying that he came from Wutai Mountain in the Han Dynasty and stayed with him, and then various auspicious signs appeared one after another.

All this shows that Master Tsongkhapa is the true reincarnation of Manjushri.

The master was given the five novice precepts at the age of three. At the age of seven, he was sent to the Xia Qiong Monastery of the Kadam School by his family. He took the secret name of Lobsang Drakpa, and later took the novice vows. In 1409, the master established Ganden Monastery, and on the foundation of the Kadam School, the Gelug School was established.

The master studied with many teachers in his life, and these masters belonged to different sects. The master gathered the heads of various schools, and after assiduous study, he gradually revealed many unparalleled talents.

In a dharma conference, Master **Shuofuwuhan** explained 15 treatises at the same time, for three consecutive months without interruption; two books were finished early, and another two were added immediately. A total of 17 treatises were lectured on during the dharma conference. At another Dharma conference, he lectured on twenty-one great treatises on the same day.

There was even a marvelous event in which twenty-nine great treatises were simultaneously lectured at the Dharma conference, which was admirable. These wonderful lectures had never taken place before in India or Tibet.

There are more than 600 volumes of the Prajna Paramita Sutra, which Buddha Shakyamuni could finish in one day, and many listeners could fully understand its profound meaning. It is only by virtue of language that such a wonderful feat can be performed.

12

In the period after the completion of his studies, no one could match the master of eloquence without hindrance, according to the scriptures and sects.

The master of learning without hindrance is able to understand all the Buddhadharma, and can realize all the holy words of the Buddha as practical teachings.

Master Khedrubje Gelek Pelzang praised: 

The Bodhisattvas in India and the Master Buston in Tibet, 

although they have learned widely, 

are not as well-versed as Master Tsongkhapa.

The Kagyu sect has a teaching of Mahamudra, the Nyingma sect has a teaching of Dzogchen, the Sakya sect has a teaching of Path and Fruit, and the Kadam sect has a teaching of impermanence and bodhicitta.

However, the only one who can teach all the sutras spoken by the Buddha is the teaching of Tsongkhapa. For this reason, the scriptures created by the masters also have the following characteristics:

Able to declare the complete path sequence for the upper, middle and lower aspects.

They are all written by the masters themselves.

Perfect and flawless, no one can refute it.

It has characteristics not found in other scriptures.

All the wise men rejoice and believe.

In the early days of the precept-keeping master, the tenets of Tibetan Buddhism were relaxed, and Khedrubje Gelek Pelzang said in the biography of Master Tsongkhapa: 

**"At the time when Buddhism in the snowy land was about to be destroyed and existed in name only, some monks even took the name of the mantle and bowl they used to become monks. Never heard of it."**

This shows how desolate Tibetan Buddhism was at that time, and the master was very distressed about it, so he strongly advocated the reformation of the precepts.

The master's own body, speech, and mind rested in a pure and solemn state. Inspired by the master, monks in large and small monasteries in Tibetan areas gradually became pure and more virtuous.

Even if I accidentally violated it occasionally, I would feel ashamed and immediately repent according to the ritual.

Many saints have been prophesied by the master Shakyamuni Buddha, Maitreya Bodhisattva, Manjushri Bodhisattva, Machig Labdrön, Candrakīrti Bodhisattva, Guru Rinpoche, etc., all of whom have prophesied Master Tsongkhapa.

Padmasambhava's "Words of Encouragement" says:

Padmasambhava foretold that a fully ordained Buddhist monk named Lobsang Drakpa would appear in the east, near the land of China who would be regarded as an emanation of a Bodhisattva of the greatest renown and would attain the Complete Enjoyment Body of Buddha – Enlightenment.

"In the East, near the Han land, there will be a Buddha named Lobsang Drakpa."

In addition, in many sutras and treatises of great siddhas, there are prophecies regarding Master Tsongkhapa, where he is called the second Buddha.

For example, Buddha Shakyamuni once foretold:
**"In the snowy regions of Tibet, there will be a person named Lobsang Drakpa who will solemnize my incarnation Buddha image as the image of Sambhogakaya."**

Later, as predicted by the Buddha, on the first day of the first lunar month in 1409, Lama Tsongkhapa personally presented a five-buddha crown made of pure gold to the Sakyamuni Buddha statue in the Jokhang Temple in Lhasa at the prayer meeting. There are many precious pearl gemstones on it, and the craftsmanship is exquisite and very strict.

14

Master Wisdom Unhindered has been diligent in studying, thinking, cultivating, lecturing, and writing throughout his life, and has written nineteen books, each of which is a masterpiece.

It can be said that every word is as precious as gold.

In particular, "The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path of Enlightenment" and "The Great Treatise on the Tantric Stages of the Path to Enlightenment" pointed out many subtle mistakes in practice, which are even more precious to later generations of disciples. The master also trained many eminent monks and great virtues, saved countless sentient beings, and reinvigorated Tibetan Buddhism, just like the reappearance of the Buddha.

Master Tsongkhapa's special qualities and merits are innumerable and inconceivable. For example, the master foresaw that sentient beings in the turbid world would be troubled and have difficulty in practicing diligently.

For the sake of all beings in the last days to be able to study, and for the Gelugpa to live for a long time in the world, the master is merciful. During the retreat of Olka Cholung, he made thirty-seven point mandala offerings a million times, and his wrists were worn through and he could see the bones. He dedicated the merits of this offering to the practitioners of later generations.

Therefore, disciples of later generations who study the Gelug school are generally wealthier and live longer.

We are very fortunate to have come across the teachings of Master Tsongkhapa, and we should cherish this fact and be grateful. There are dozens of biographies of Master Tsongkhapa, many of which are written by later eminent monks, great virtues, and great achievers. We have time to read more, so that we can strengthen our confidence in the Dharma and in our study.

16

Section 2 - "The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path to Enlightenment" talks about the order of the Path. Therefore, the excellence of the "The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path to Enlightenment" is the speciality of the Three Aspects.

Enlightenment is also the ultimate victory of the path.

"TThe Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path to Enlightenment" has five outstanding qualities: the creator, the teaching, the location, the persuasion, and the family.

1. Venerable Atisha, the creator of the Three Principal Aspects, is the incarnation of Amitabha. There were countless disciples in India at that time, and many of them obtained high achievements.

When His Holiness Venerable Atisha went to Tibet to teach the Dharma, he mainly taught the Three Aspects, which enabled countless practitioners in Tibet to be liberated by studying according to these Three Scopes.

The teachings of His Holiness also influenced the major schools in Tibet, especially the Gelug sect, which was formerly known as the New Kadampa.

Master Tsongkhapa, the creator of the broad and brief discussion of the path to enlightenment, is the reincarnation of Manjushri. The master explained in detail the three aspects of the path of Venerable Atisha, and created a complete Buddhist practice in Tibetan areas. It had never been done before.

17

Before Master Tsongkhapa, most monks in Tibet had abolished the precepts. In practice, those who meditate cannot distinguish between gross and subtle drowsiness, those who practice emptiness do not understand the deep insight of the Middle Way, and those who practice tantric methods do not understand **phantom body and double body movement**.

The emergence of the master has corrected these phenomena one by one. 

It can be said that Master Tsongkhapa saved Tibetan Buddhism.

2. The Exceptional Teachings:

The special teachings include: the quality is correct; the quantity is perfect; the order is accurate.

(1) The nature is correct

The content of "The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path to Enlightenment" is completely correct in nature, without the slightest error.

In the past, the writings of many great siddhas in Tibet contained many errors in their insight.

Tsongkhapa's eldest disciple, Gyaltsab Je, said that before he met the master, his understanding of emptiness based on the writings of previous scholars was wrong.

Most of the previous commentators achieved success in the lower aspects, such as renunciation and bodhicitta. Even if they achieved success, they did not necessarily realize emptiness.

18

Therefore, in terms of the nature of the Dharma taught by the previous generations, there were a few errors.

What Tsongkhapa said is not at all wrong in nature, it is very accurate and complete.

(2) The quantity is complete

The entire contents of "The Great Treatise on the Stages" of the Path to Enlightenment are extraordinary.

why? Because it is widely discussed that the lineage of Nagarjuna and Asanga is the two major vehicles.

Buddha Shakyamuni once predicted: 

"The practitioners of the later generations will follow Nagarjuna and Asanga Bodhisattva to practice, and to follow other great achievers, the foundation of some people is suitable, but in terms of the foundation of all people, not necessarily suitable.”

Therefore, Shakyamuni Buddha said: 

"In common practice, everyone must follow Nagarjuna and Asanga Bodhisattva."

The essentials of "the "The Noble Sūtra of Recalling the Three Jewels" taught by Buddha Shakyamuni are all condensed in the "The Graded Stages of the Path to Enlightenment", and the outline of the extensive treatise is the The Three Principal Aspects of the Path.

Dharma should be learned through listening, thinking, and practicing.

But if there are too many dharma books to study, or if you don’t have the concept of order in your mind, you won’t be able to read it, because 84,000 dharmas can’t be read or learned completely.

Master Tsongkhapa condensed the essence of the 84,000 Dharma doors in a book "The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path to Enlightenment", and explained the stages of Buddhist practice completely and clearly, so it can be called a perfect number.

19

(3) The order is accurate

In "The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path to Enlightenment", the stages of practice are explained very clearly.

It is very clear where to start training when you are just getting started, and how to continue practicing over time.

If the order is not clear, it will be confusing and lead to blind and disorderly learning.

Only the Bodhisattvas of the Eighth Stage (bhumi) can cultivate the Dharma door, and ordinary people will not be able to achieve it.

It is very, very important to study in order! Whether it is lecturing the scriptures or practicing, if the order is not correct, there will be no achievement.

This is different from reading a book. When reading a book, you need to read more about the news, and you can read any book.

When you really want to make progress in your practice, you have to do it in sequence, so that you won't make mistakes and you will be successful.

If there is no order, there will be no achievement, just as wandering around will not help you reach your destination.

3. The place where you live is the place where you live.

20

Master Tsongkhapa was in Radreng Monastery when he wrote "The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path of Enlightenment".

Radreng Monastery was founded in 1057 by the founder of the Kadampa, Dromtonpa, and has a history of more than 900 years. It is the first monastery of the Kadampa.

"Radreng" means "to eradicate all afflictions until free from rebirth of the three evil realms". Buddha Sakyamuni had a prophecy about the Radreng Monastery in the Buddhist scriptures.

Studying, practicing or writing about the practice of the predecessors, the blessing is very powerful, and it is easy to achieve.

The location of Radreng Monastery used to be a bald mountain without a single tree. Later, Songtsan Gampo, the incarnation of Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva, visited here, sprinkled water for washing his hair on the hillside, and prayed for blessings, so two trees grew. There are 15,000 verdant Thuja trees, all of which were prophesied in Buddhist scriptures.

In Radreng Monastery, there are spiritual bone stupas of Master Jinzhou, Venerable Atisha, and Master Dromtonpa, as well as sacred objects such as the statue of Venerable Atisha.

4. After persuading Master Tsongkhapa to practice according to "A Lamp for the Path to Enlightenment" for a period of time, he attained the achievement of the Three Aspects.

At this time, the master saw with his own eyes the lineage masters of the two major sects all appearing in front of him.

From Shakyamuni Buddha to the master's own master, including Manjushri, Nagarjuna, as well as all the great virtues of Kadampa, such as Master Dromtonpa  and Master Bodowa, he also saw Venerable Atisha with my own eyes.


Then, all the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas and teachers merged into the body of Venerable Atisha, who put his hand on the head of Master Tsongkhapa and said, "You want to benefit all sentient beings, and write the "Guide to Bodhi", I'm here to help you and bless you."

After speaking, Venerable Atisha merged into Master Tsongkhapa's body.

At the same time, **Guan Que Hua Sang**, a great siddha in Tibet at that time, also encouraged Master Tsongkhapa.

In the end, Master Tsongkhapa wrote "The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path of Enlightenment."

During the time when the master was writing "The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path of Enlightenment", Manjushri came in person three times.

The first time he came to persuade Master Tsongkhapa to write "The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path of Enlightenment".

When he wrote about the meditation and wisdom method of the The Three Principal Aspects of the Path, that is, the meditation paramita and the wisdom paramita, the master thought: Now there are too many people without great wisdom, and it is useless to write too much in this part.

Manjushri Bodhisattva appeared again and said to Master Tsongkhapa: "If you write more deep and broad meditation and wisdom perfection, it will be of great benefit to all living beings in future generations."

There were human beings and non-human beings among the disciples who supported Master Tsongkhapa's writing "The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path of Enlightenment".

For example, during the period when the master wrote the Great Treatise, his diet was mainly taken care of by the land gods of the three thousand great thousand worlds, especially Animaqin, who was a mountain god of Ando Goluo and a Bodhisattva of the Tenth Stage.



5. After Master Tsongkhapa wrote the "The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path of Enlightenment", countless human beings and non-human beings have been liberated by studying the Great Treatise.

Among them, it is even more difficult to count those who are able to perform both exoteric and esoteric practices and promote Mahayana Buddhism.

Among the disciples of the master, not to mention those who have attained ordinary achievements, are those who are proficient in the essentials of the Tripitaka, and those who have completed the three disciplines of precepts, concentration, and wisdom, and those who have practised intensively in the three ways of spirituality and the second stage of Tantra, are like the stars in the night sky, innumerable.

Among them, Gyaltsab Je, Kedrub Je, Zhaba Jianshen, Jamyang Choje,  Jamchen Choje (Daci Dharma King), Gyu Sherab-sengge (Hui Shishi), Gyelwa Gendun-drub and others.

Gyaltsab Je and Kedrub Je inherited the throne of Master Tsongkhapa and ascended to Ganden Tripa (the head of Ganden Monastery, that is, the Dharma King of Yellow Hat school), which laid the foundation for the Gelugpa School.

They were the two most outstanding disciples who carried forward the teachings of Master Tsongkhapa.

Master Tsongkhapa, Gyaltsab Je, and Kedrub Je were later honored as "Three Masters of Tsongkhapa".



Section 3 - Other writings on the stages of the path 

1. Other writings on the stages of the path 

If we understand the "The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path to Enlightenment", we will understand the sequence of the Path to Enlightenment, and we will understand how we should practice in the future.

The Great Treatise is our teacher and mentor.

My guru, Dharma King Yongzeng's teacher, was Rako Rinpoche. After Rako Rinpoche's teacher passed away, he wrote a letter to another great siddha saying, "To my teacher who taught the scriptures. After passing away, I want to find another guru, which one do you think is more suitable?" 

The great siddhi replied, "Master Tsongkhapa's "TThe Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path to Enlightenment" and "The Stages of the Path of Tantra" These two works are your best teachers."

Therefore, we need to realize the greatness of the The Great Treatise. If we practice according to the order in the The Great Treatise, we will definitely achieve success. It depends on whether we believe it or not, whether we study it or not, whether we practice or not, and whether we can be diligent or not.

This is because "The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path to Enlightenment" mainly focuses on the cultivation methods of ordinary people, not only for those who have been incarnated as Bodhisattvas and those who are great achievers.

A few years after Master Tsongkhapa wrote The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path to Enlightenment,, taking into account the liberation of all living beings in later generations, the master shortened the profound teachings in the Treatise and produced "The Brief Treatise on the Stages of the Path to Enlightenment".


It focuses on the main points of practical training, and the emphasis of The Brief Treatise is different. The two treatises can complement each other and facilitate the study and practice of future generations.

At the same time, the master also realized that for practitioners in later generations, the teachings of these two treatises are still relatively broad, and some people may not know how to use these broader teachings for practice in the future.

Therefore, the Master graciously instructed: "Though there are very few people who can understand that all discourses are practice, you can first summarize the things that should be practiced, and describe them in detail in a separate book."

After receiving such a promise from the master, the later great siddhas wrote books based on their own understanding of the "The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path to Enlightenment", and wrote hundreds of books before and after. There are eight chapters, called the **Eight Great Guidances.**

That is, Master Tsongkhapa's "The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path to Enlightenment (Lam-rim chen-mo)", "A Brief Commnetary on the Stages of the Path to Enlightenment", and "Dao Song"; the fourth Panchen Lama's "The Path of Peace", referred to as "Le Dao"; the fifth Panchen Lama The Master's "Direct Teaching of the Path to Bodhi", referred to as "Speed ​​Path"; "The Path: Pure Gold" by the Third Dalai Lama; "Manjushri Dictation" by the Fifth Dalai Lama; The Essence of Eloquence".

Among them, "Speed ​​Road" can be regarded as the annotation of "Le Dao", and "Manjushri's Dictation" can be regarded as the annotation of "Dao Ji Di • Pure Gold".

25

The basis of the **Eight Great Guidance** is also the "The Lamp of the Path to Enlightenment".

The masters who inherit the teachings of the eight great guides and other stages of the path belong to the creators of the three aspects.

2. The Importance of the Sequence of the Paths

In the study of Buddhism, the purity of the lineage of the Dharma is very important.

The primary condition for the purity of the Dharma lineage is that the Dharma learned and cultivated must be inherited.

Having a lineage refers to the Dharma that has been heard and practiced. It has been passed down from generation to generation by the lineage teachers, starting with Buddha Shakyamuni, without addition or removal, until it is passed on to us.

With lineage, there will be blessings in practice.

The lineage includes different aspects, including the lineage of empowerment, the lineage of oral transmission, the lineage of sermons, and so on.

Oral transmission is the teaching of classics that the guru recites and wants to pass on to the disciples. The disciple listens carefully, and after listening to all of them, the continuum of the miind will get the lineage of oral transmission. When they cultivate a certain way of life, they will suddenly think of everything that the master has recited.

The lineage of sermons is the lineage of the sutras that the master has. Once he teaches the sutras to the disciples, the disciples obtain the lineage.

The lineage of our Three Principal Aspects of the Path and the Eight Great Guidance is the lineage of lecturing and oral transmission.

Our lineage was passed down by two great siddhis, Gyaltsab Je and Kedrub Je, disciples of Master Tsongkhapa.

26

It was passed on to the Fourth Panchen Lama, the fourth Panchen Lama is the reincarnation of the second coming of Master Tsongkhapa recognized in Tibet.

Then it was slowly passed on to the third Gongtang Rinpoche, and finally to Rako Rinpoche, Rako Rinpoche passed it on to Dharma King Yongzeng, and Dharma King Yongzeng passed it on to me.

I have studied under seven masters: Dharma King Yongzeng, Dharma King Yeshe Gyatso, Guru Kazang Qusong Vajra, the 10th Panchen Lama, Gelga Rinpoche, Lobsang Dorje Vajra, and Geshe Rinpoche. Disciple of Rako Rinpoche.

So, our lineage is that of Rako Rinpoche.

I myself have received the lineage of the Three Principal Aspects of the Path and the Eight Great Guidances from Dharma King Yongzeng, and the Three Principal Aspects of the Paths, The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path to Enlightenment, and The Brief Commentary on the Stages of the Path to Enlightenment from Master Gazang Qusong Vajra and Dharma King Yeshe Gyatso. The lineages of "A Brief Commentary" and "The Way of Peace" have also received other guidance from other masters. It is very important to have a lineage!

...

Contemplate the meaning of this method

That gathers the essence of all the scriptures;

Even teaching or hearing a single session definitely gathers great waves

Of the assembled benefits of explaining or listening to the holy Dharma.

---


Rely, correctly and with effort, in thought and action

On the holy spiritual friend, the teacher of the path

And the foundation perfectly bringing auspiciousness

For all the excellent collections of this and future lives.

Having seen this, do not give him up even at the cost of your life,

And please him with the offering of practicing just as he instructs.

I, a yogi, practiced like this.

You who desire liberation, should do likewise.

---


.......... Lines of Experience

Chapter 1 - The root of the Path is to be close to the guru.

The guru is the teacher who preaches the sutras and the Dharma, is the good teacher, the source of all good virtues, the teacher who acts for the Buddhas, fulfills the responsibilities that the Buddhas have not fulfilled, and guides the liberation of all living beings. Therefore, the guru is the root of the Path.

Choosing a teacher is very important. To learn The Three Principal Aspects of the Path, you must first respect the guru, because the guru is not only the guru in this life, but also the reliance of future generations. Therefore, worshiping a guru is a great plan for all eternity. If you choose a good guru, you will benefit from it for eternity;

Choosing the right guru is also very easy. However, if you choose a guru who does not have the qualifications and virtues, you will have great troubles.

For example, disciples who have not reached the level of tantric empowerment may break their precepts after empowerment, and they will fall into evil realms in future generations. A truly good teacher will observe, and a disciple will not receive the empowerment until he reaches the level required for the empowerment. The same is true of precepts. If the vows are pure, the guru will pass them on. If the precepts are observed to be novel and fun, the virtuous guru will not pass them on.

If you worship a bad guru, or a guru who has not achieved success in learning and cultivation, and does not deeply understand the Buddhadharma, they may teach and guide their disciples to misunderstanding. When the master rejects other dharmas, the disciples also reject them; when the master says that a certain bodhisattva is not good, the disciples also say the same, and the disciples also follow the master to hell, and in the end they all fall into the evil realm.

Therefore, you must choose a good teacher, and you must not follow just any teacher indiscriminately.

Choosing the right teacher is very, very important!

After choosing a teacher with virtue and qualifications, if you want to be a teacher who guides your own practice, you must also take refuge in this teacher.

First bow three times in front of the guru, and then follow the guru in reciting the four refuges three times.

If you don't take refuge, you're not considered a master. Even if you listen to a certain guru teach the Dharma and participate in empowerments, you're not considered a master.

After deciding to follow a master, you must have firm confidence in the master.

If you can believe in the guru just like you believe in the Buddhas and Tathagatas, you can get the blessings of the Buddhas and Tathagatas in body, speech, and mind.

Our troubles are like cotton, the blessings of Buddhas and Tathagatas are like sunshine, and the blessings of teachers are like a magnifying glass.

32

The magnifying glass can concentrate sunlight to burn cotton, and so does the blessing of the guru. The blessings of the Buddhas and Tathagatas converge on us through the guru, and troubles will soon be eliminated.

33

Section 1 - Qualifications of a Guru

The guru we want to follow, in general, needs to meet five conditions: pure precepts; perfect understanding of the Dharma; great kindness and compassion; pure lineage; understanding of emptiness.

1. Basic requirements for a guru 

(1) Purity of the vows 

As a guru, the precepts must be pure.

If the guru is a monk, then the monk vows must be pure.

Tibetan Buddhist monks have 253 precepts, all of which must be pure.

If the teacher has taken the Bodhisattva Vows, the Bodhisattva Vows divided into eighteen fundamental vows and forty-six secondary vows, these precepts must be pure and unbroken.

Likewise, if one takes the Tantric vows, the fourteen fundamental precepts and eight secondary precepts of the Tantric vehicle must also be impeccably upheld.

Purity of discipline is the first condition of being a guru.

(2) Fully understand the Buddhadharma

 There are 84,000 Dharma gates, and as a guru, one must understand the various points.

34

The way of the Gelug School.

It is necessary to understand the many Sutras, otherwise teachings will be misunderstood and rejected.

These misunderstandings or leading others to misunderstand are all forms of slandering the Dharma, and bring extremely bad karma.

Being able to fully understand the Dharma is the second condition for being a guru.

(3) Masters with great compassion and great kindness must have a great compassionate heart that wishes all sentient beings to have happiness and the causes of happiness, and a great compassionate heart that wishes all sentient beings to be free from suffering and the causes of suffering.

You must teach the Dharma for the sake of saving sentient beings with compassion, not for the sake of fame and fortune.

(4) Purity of Lineage

 A Guru must have a Lineage.
 
 Not only the Lineage, but the Lineage must be pure.

Our Lineage extends from Sakyamuni Buddha to Manjushri Bodhisattva and Maitreya Bodhisattva, then on to Venerable Atisha, Master Tsongkhapa, and then from Gyaltsab Je and Kedrub Je to the fourth Panchen Lama, the third Gongtang Rinpoche, and finally to Rako Rinpoche, and Rako Rinpoche to Dharma Master Yongzeng.

35

From Buddha Shakyamuni to Venerable Atisha was the lineage of the Prajna Paramita Sutra. During that period, the deep and broad paths were transmitted separately.

Beginning with Venerable Atisha, the lineages of the deep and broad paths were combined into one.

In this way, for the lineage of the entire path to enlightenment, from Buddha Shakyamuni to Dharma King Yongzeng reaches the forty-fifth generation, and Dharma King Yongzeng passed it on to me, the lineage is very pure and unbroken.

It has been more than 2,500 years since the birth of Buddha Shakyamuni, and the reason why the lineage of the path has only gone through forty-five generations is that in the lineage of the Bodhi path, many lineage masters lived in the world for a long time.

For example, Nagarjuna Bodhisattva lived for over 600 years, his disciple Chandrakirti Bodhisattva lived for over 350 years, and there are many other long-lived lineage masters.

The lineage of other dharmas has already exceeded forty-five generations.

Purity of lineage is extremely important.

The pure lineage means that the Dharma taught by the guru started from Buddha Shakyamuni and was passed down unchanged from generation to generation.

In the process of teaching the Dharma, the master's own understandings and concepts were not added. 

Some masters admitted that they themselves were wrong, and then eliminated the Dharma meaning of the lineage. And each generation of the masters of the lineage have never lost confidence in their own masters. 

Nowadays, many masters, when teaching the Dharma, will consciously or unintentionally add their own opinions and ideas, and pass them on to their disciples, such as "In my opinion ..." and so on.

36

This kind of master breaks the pure lineage, or destroys the cleanliness of the lineage, so the Dharma handed down is not pure and complete.

The The Three Principal Aspects of the Path that I teach you is passed down from the masters of the past generations, until my master passed it on to me and taught it to me, and it has been passed down to you in its entirety. There is no such phrase as "In my opinion ..." 

What is added after that is all the Dharma passed down by Buddhas and Bodhisattvas, and ordinary people's opinions are not necessarily the Dharma.

Having a pure and complete lineage is the fourth condition for being a guru.

(5) Understanding Emptiness

Understanding emptiness means being able to understand emptiness through words and language.

As a teacher, it is best to realize emptiness.

Because the root of liberation is the realization of emptiness.

If you don't realize emptiness, you must at least understand emptiness. If your teacher doesn't understand emptiness, he can't talk about emptiness, and he can't guide his disciples on the path to liberation.

These are the five basic conditions that you need to have to be a guru.

37

There is a difference between a guru and a normal master. A gura needs to meet the above five conditions, and a guru must have the will and wisdom to save all sentient beings. The "Master" we usually refer to does not necessarily have to meet these conditions.

Therefore, when taking refuge in Tibetan Buddhism, one must take refuge in the guru. The main aim of the practice of Theravada Buddhism is to save oneself, so the master of Theravada is called the teacher, not the guru.

In general, if you want to follow a guru, you must follow a guru who meets the above five conditions.

Gurus can be divided into precept gurus, Mahayana gurus, and Tantric gurus, all of which have different requirements.

#### 2. Requirements for the Ordination Guru

The conditions for the guru to teach the precepts and vows require that the teacher who imparts the precepts and the vows refers to the guru Guru who taught the Five Precepts, the Novice Precepts, and the Bhikkhu Precepts.

A precept master also needs to meet five conditions: purity of precepts; knowledge of discipline; compassion; cleanliness of residence; patience.

(1) Purity of precepts

 As a teacher of precepts and vows, first of all, he must have received ordination and upheld the vows of monks, for more than ten years.

38

Not only should the discipline be pure, but the vows should also be unbroken.

For example, when you wear a cassock, you need to dress very standardly and not casually.

Precepts and tenets must be pure.

(2) Masters who are familiar with the precepts and vows must be familiar with the prescribed requirements of the precepts.

For example, it is necessary to understand what is abstinence and what is a violation of the precepts; if one violates the precepts, how to repent and remedy them, etc.

Another example is when preaching the Five Precepts, it is required to be able to recite the rituals for preaching the precepts, and not to read out according to the original text.

Mastering the requirements of these precepts is called mastery of the discipline.

(3) It is absolutely impossible to have no compassion.

 Without compassion, one is not qualified to be a guru.

(4) The place of residence is clean.

 The place of residence is clean, that is, the environment in which the masters who teach and give precepts live should be clean.

This means that the master's living environment and interpersonal interactions should not affect his own vows, such as living in a clean place such as a monastery, a mountain or a forest.

39

(5) Know the correct timing

TWhen preaching precepts and teachings, we need to talk about timing, as well as seasonal regulations, the appropriate age for taking vows, and the length of time for retreat, etc.
The temporal requirements specified in the precepts must be mastered.

For example, it is necessary to understand the age rules for giving ordination.

One must be twenty years old to be ordained as a monk, and seven years old to receive novice vows. The teacher must know this.

The above are the five conditions that must be fulfilled by the guru transmitting precepts and conferring ordination.

3. Requirements for a Mahayana Guru 

Maitreya Bodhisattva says in the "Ornament of Mahāyāna Sūtras":

>
>One should follow a spiritual teacher who is disciplined, peaceful, serene,
>
>Endowed with special qualities, diligent, rich in scriptural learning,
>
>Highly realized concerning the nature of reality, skilled in speaking,
>
>The embodiment of love, and indefatigable.
>

The requirements for the masters lecturing and teaching the Mahayana are relatively high, and they need to meet ten conditions: possessing morality; possessing determination; possessing wisdom; profound knowledge; Patience.


##### (1) Disciplined

Training in ethical discipline with vows. The purpose is to use precepts to tame the unruly mind, so the precepts should be pure.

The precepts can be divided into three categories: 

The vow of non-liberation (for oneself alone), 

Bodhisattva vows, 

Tantric vows.

The precepts of non-liberation include the Theravadan eight precepts, the Upasaka precepts, the Upasaka special precepts, the novice precepts, the novice precepts, the study precepts, the monk precepts, and the precepts of nuns.

Keeping the precept of non-liberation can subdue the evil karma of body and speech.

That is, the person must not kill, steal, or commit sexual misconduct, and must not speak lies, slander, double-talk, or harsh words.

Taking the Bodhisattva Vows can subdue the sinful karma of body, speech, and mind, especially the mind.

For example, to subdue miserliness, it is required not to be miserly in wealth, nor to be miserly in Dharma, which is a matter of body and speech; it is also required to practice generosity frequently, all of which are aimed at subduing miserliness.

The eighteen Bodhisattva Vows are mainly methods for subduing the mind.

The Tantric Vows are also methods of subduing the mind.

When these three vows are kept, they will naturally subdue the body, speech, and mind.

Taking precepts with vows can completely subdue the body and speech, but not the mind. The way to completely subdue the mind is to meditate.

41

##### (2) Having sufficient concentration 

Form, sound, smell, taste, and touch, is called external environment. Having concentration and being unaffected by external conditions means having sufficient determination.

As a teacher, the mind must be able to settle down, and if you have the ability to meditate, it will be even more extraordinary.

Many of our lineage masters were highly skilled in meditation.

If you don't have the ability to meditate, you need to keep your mind stable at all times and not be troubled by external disturbances.

##### (3) Wisdom 

Wisdom here refers to the wisdom of distinguishing right from wrong.

As a teacher, you must have a strong ability to distinguish between good and evil, and if you have the wisdom of emptiness, it will be even more extraordinary.

##### (4) Wealth of Scriptural Knowledge

As a teacher with profound scriptural knowledge, one must be able to fully understand the Dharma.

First of all, you must master the methods of Theravada, then learn the methods of the Mahayana Buddhism, and then learn the methods of the Tantra. All of these must be learned.

In Tibetan Buddhism, it takes about sixteen years to learn the methods of Theravada and Mahayana sutras first.

During these sixteen years, the master has to teach the scriptures every day, and disciples have to recite them every day, and then learn and master it by debating the scriptures. Next, it takes seven or eight years to learn the tantra method.

42

All in all, even if he is very diligent, an ordinary Tibetan Buddhist monk needs to study for more than 20 years before he can become a guru.

Not only that, as a guru, one must also master the teachings of the Tripitaka and the five traditional monastic subjects.

The ten topics of the five traditional monastic subjects and Ming Dynasties include astronomy, geography, medicine, and craftsmanship, etc. In Tibet, this knowledge was held in the monasteries, and the good teachers who possess this knowledge were also in the monasteries.

Therefore, during the winter and summer vacations, there are always many students who come to the monastery to study.

If you are proficient in the Tripitaka, you will have deep knowledge; if you are proficient in all the five traditional monastic subjects and Ten Learnings, you will have a broader range of knowledge.

As a guru, the most important thing is to be proficient in the essentials of the Tripitaka.

##### (5) Right View

Having the right view refers to the right view of the emptiness of dependent origination, the right view of the person without the self, the right view of the law without the self, and so on.

The sutra says: 

"Virtues are more important than life, and right view is more important than morality."

Without right view, it is impossible to have right faith, right thought, and right practice.

As a teacher, at the very least, you must understand emptiness, and it is better to realize emptiness. In this way, you have the right view of emptiness.

43

##### (6) Superior Morality and Ability

As a teacher, it is very important to surpass the disciple in virtue and ability.

The Bodhisattva Vasubandhu said in the "Collections of Relatives and Friends":

Those who worship the inferior will degenerate, 

Those who worship the same will not make progress, 

Those who worship the superior will make progress, 

And those who worship the superior should be taken as teachers.

That is to say, if you worship a teacher whose morality is lower than your own, you will also degenerate; if you worship a teacher who is similar to you in all aspects, you will not make progress; only by worshiping a teacher can you surpass your own level. Then there will be progress.

Therefore, we should take refuge in a teacher whose virtues and talents are superior to our own.

This is not necessarily in some special cases.

For example, none of Tsongkhapa's teachers surpassed Tsongkhapa in virtue and talent. Later, these teachers worshiped Tsongkhapa as their guru.

Master Tsongkhapa had more than forty teachers, and the most outstanding is Master Rendawa.

When Master Tsongkhapa studied the five great treatises, most of the content was taught by Master Rendawa.

At the end of each lecture, Master Rendawa questioned Master Tsongkhapa. He found that Master Tsongkhapa understood differently from himself. Master Tsongkhapa had a deeper and broader understanding. This was the case every time.

44

So after finishing the five great treatises, Master Rendawa followed Master Tsongkhapa as his teacher.

Several other teachers of Master Tsongkhapa later became students of Master Tsongkhapa and took him as their master. There is such a situation in Tibet, if the disciples are good in virtue, knowledge and achievements, a master will follow the disciples as masters.

In general, the morality of the master must surpass that of the disciple.

##### (7) Diligence and hard work

As a teacher, you must be diligent, study hard, and constantly improve yourself.

You must also be diligent in teaching your disciples, diligent in teaching the Dharma, diligent in practice, and diligent in all aspects.

##### (8) Skill in Instructing Disciples

This means to be fluent in teaching the scriptures and teaching the Dharma, so that you can speak freely and without hindrance.

The language should be able to express the content of the scriptures clearly and satisfactorily.

##### (9) Compassionate Guru

 It is very important to have a compassionate mind, and it is a very necessary condition for the promotion of Buddhism.

45

A compassionate guru will affect the people around him, making people very relaxed physically and mentally, and they will be more receptive when hearing the Dharma, and the disciples will be more willing to follow such a guru.

At the same time, because of his compassion for all beings, such a master will take the initiative to remove all kinds of obstacles when he propagates the Dharma, which is more conducive to the spread and promotion of the Dharma.

(10) Be patient. Abandoned Dispiritedness

As a guru, you must be patient and not get annoyed.

Because every disciple has different abilities, qualities, habits, etc., they may ask the same questions over and over again when they are just starting out, or in the process of learning and cultivation. The master must be patient and never tire of answering questions or giving explanations.

To be a Mahayana teacher who teaches sutras and Dharma, one must meet the above ten conditions.

#### 4. Requirements for a Tantric Guru: 

There are many more requirements for a master of Tantra empowerments than those for a Mahayana master. At least thirteen conditions must be met: 

Uphold the three righteousness; be full of wisdom; be patient; be upright; No fraud; understand medicine and mantra; have compassion; know scriptures and teachings; master double ten methods;

46

##### (1) Protecting the Three Doors

This refers to the three righteousnesses of body, speech and mind.

 And avoiding the following harmful actions:

 Body:

1. Destroying life

2. Taking what is not given

3. Wrong sexual conduct

Speech:

4. False speech

5. Slanderous speech

6. Harsh speech

7. Idle chatter

Righteousness of heart is righteousness of mind.

##### (2) Thorough Knowledge of Reality

The wisdom of the tantric empowerment masters exceeds that of the Mahayana sutra masters. The ability to distinguish between good and evil must be highly developed, and they must also have a very keen insight.

refers to a special training in 
wisdom, the selflessness of phenomena

(3) Tolerance: 

To be able to endure humiliation, to be able to endure all kinds of hardships in the practice, and all kinds of hardships while teaching the Dharma.

(4) Upright character:

Tantric masters must be upright, have a kind heart, and cannot be cunning or scheming.

47

##### (5) No deception 

As a tantric master, one cannot deceive people.

There is no such thing as supernatural power, so you cannot say that you have supernatural powers. If you have not attained bodhicitta, you cannot say that you have bodhicitta, and you cannot deceive others.

##### (6) Understand Medicine

To be able to save all sentient beings, one must also be proficient in medical remedies and medicine in general.

In Tantra, there are many ways to use medicine to eliminate disasters. 

Some medicines and tantric incantations can be used to eliminate disasters.

So, as a tantric guru, it is very important to master these.

##### (7) Compassion 

A Guru who imparts precepts must have compassion, as should all Mahayana and Tantric masters.

To be a guru requires great compassion.

##### (8) Deep Knowledge of scriptures and teachings

One must be proficient in the teachings of the Mahayana and Hinayana Vehicles, as well as the teachings of the Sutra and Tantra.

As a Tantric Guru, it is a very important requirement to understand all the scriptures and teachings of Theravada, Mahayana and Tantra.

48

##### (9) Mastery of the Double Ten 

The Dharma of Tantra is divided into outer and inner tantras.

The outer tantras are of four classes.

Kriya tantra (bya-rgyud) – ritual deity practice

Charya tantra (spyod-rgyud) – behavioral deity practice

Yoga tantra (rnal-'byor rgyud)– integrated deity practice

Anuttarayoga (bla-med rnal-'byor rgyud) – peerlessly integrated (highest yoga) deity practice.

Three of these belong to the path of the lower scope.

Ritual, Behavioural, and Yoga.

The inner tantra refers to the tantra of the Supreme Yoga, and the double ten methods refer to the ten kinds of knowledge, skills and practices of the outer and inner tantras that the tantric master should be skilled or proficient in the use of.

The lower tantric masters must master the ten outer tantric methods, and the Supreme Yoga masters must master the inner tantric ten methods.

##### 1. 10 Outer Tantric Practices

The ten outer tantric methods include: Mandala offering; Guru yoga; mudra method; Prostration; sitting posture method; Vajrasattva mantra recitation; Zache Kadro fire puja method; Reading method.

(1) Drawing, constructing and visualizing the mandala abodes of the meditational deities

The mandala in the 10 outer tantras refers to the colored and colorless mandala. It is necessary to know how to draw and contemplate these mandalas.

(2) Maintaining the different states of single-minded concentration

Yoga is the method of visualization, and you must know how to meditate.

(3) Executing the hand gestures (mudras)

There are many different mudras in the tantra of the mudra method. There are many mudras for offerings when making offerings, and there are also many mudras for welcoming guests.

As a tantric master, you must understand and know these hand and foot gestures.

(4) Performing the ritual dances

The body method is the method of how the body moves.

When studying the energy-channels, the first step is to soften the channels of the whole body. At this time, it is necessary to use the body method to cultivate, which requires a lot of practice.

In tantric yoga, there are many ways to cultivate winds, channels, drops, and to adjust the body. You must understand all of these.

(5) Sitting in the full meditation position

Sitting postures include Vajra sitting and Bodhisattva sitting.

There are also many kinds of Bodhisattva sitting, such as lotus sitting and growth sitting.

Maitreya Bodhisattva's sitting method is the contemplative posture, Vajra Buddha's sitting method is lotus posture, and the essentials of these sitting methods must be mastered.

(6) Reciting what is appropriate to these two classes of tantra

There are six Dharma faults in reciting mantras incorrectly: speaking too fast; speaking too slowly; unclear pronunciation; inaccurate pronunciation; too loud; too soft.

If you recite mantras incorrectly, the blessing will be weak, so you must know how to recite mantras correctly.

(7) Making fire offerings 

Fire offering includes four kinds of fire offerings: pacifying, enriching, magnetizing, and wrathful. 

You must know how to perform these.

(8) Making the various other offerings

 You should be familiar with the methods of offering external, internal, and secret offerings.

Mahayana has only external offerings, and only Tantric schools have internal offerings and secret offerings.

Internal offerings are offerings of the skull cap, containing nectar.

Secret offerings are the tantric method. Making offerings is indistinguishable from emptiness and happiness, and emptiness and great bliss are indistinguishable from each other, so it is called the bliss of emptiness.

(9) Performing the rituals of:

a) Pacification of disputes, famine, and disease,

b) Increase of life span, knowledge, and wealth,

c) Power to influence others

d) Wrathful elimination of demonic forces and interferences

Tantric masters must understand these methods.

(10) Invoking meditational deities and dissolving them back into their appropriate places

When welcoming the deity, how to welcome the deity; after the invocation, how to make offerings and practice; after the practice, how to return the deity.

These have specific rituals and visualizations, and you need to know how to do them.

The above are the Ten Dharmas of Outer Secrets.

**2. The Ten Inner Tantras include:**

Circle of protection; amulet making; vase empowerment and secret empowerment; wisdom empowerment and speech empowerment; isolation; ; Soothing the gods and consecrating the light;


(1) Visualizing the circle of protection and eliminating obstacles

If the guru wants to protect a disciple for some reason, he can use the meditation gate to visualize an amulet or a circle of protection, and he must know how to visualize it.

(2) Preparing and consecrating protection knots and amulets to be worn around the neck 

Proficient in the writing and practice of amulets.

(3) Conferring the vase and secret initiations, planting the seeds for attaining a buddha’s form bodies

The treasure vase empowerment method and the secret empowerment method includes the immovable Tathagata aquarium water empowerment, the Amitabha Buddha Vajra holding empowerment, the Vajra Buddha Vajra bell empowerment, the Many Treasures Tathagata Crown Banner empowerment, and the Vairocana name empowerment.

Tantric masters need to be proficient in both vase empowerments and tantric empowerments.

(4) Conferring the wisdom and speech initiations, planting the seeds for attaining a buddha’s wisdom bodies

The bliss of emptiness obtained through the nectar blessed by the Vajra Guru is wisdom empowerment.

The aspiration to realize the wisdom mind of the unity that defies the intellect through the words recited by the guru is the speech empowerment.

Tantric masters should be proficient in the wisdom empowerment and speech empowerment.

(5) Separating the enemies of Dharma from their own protectors

Some people often do evil, generate bad karma, and even destroy monasteries and cities, kill their fathers and mothers, break good laws, rules and regulations.

Having fallen to this level, they can always seem to escape punishment. This may be due to the help of the worldly gods or demonic beings in the world. In this situation, the isolation method must be used to isolate the worldly gods and demonic beings.

Once isolated or tamed, they is incapable of doing bad things.

Generally, people who do these bad things are doing so because the devil and other demons are helping him.

Tantric masters must be proficient in isolation.

(6) Making the offerings, such as of sculptured tormas

Tormas, also known as offering cakes are is made of flour, ghee, and sugar. They have specific shapes and rituals.

They is used to make offerings to Buddhas, Bodhisattvas, deities, Dharma protectors, or to give to sentient beings in the six realms. The main purpose is to accumulate merit and build up positive karma.

---

The meaning of Xi Zeng Huai Zhu means: refers to the four Buddhist esoteric methods of breathing method, increasing method, holding method, and killing method. The method of relieving disasters is the method of relieving disasters, which is similar to the methods of eliminating disasters and repenting in the teachings. Enhancing the Dharma is the way to increase the merit and wisdom of sentient beings. To embrace the Dharma is to make sentient beings enjoy the joy of the Ten Dharma Realms, to turn evil into good, to turn enemies into friends, to turn consciousness into wisdom, and to turn afflictions into enlightenment. Punishment is the way to remove demonic obstacles for sentient beings.

---

There are four ways for Tormas to be used. The Torma can be visualized as the principal deity during practice, during the time of offering the torma as limitless desirable offerings, during receiving blessings as the wisdom nectar, and in order to reverse negative forces as a magical weapon with great compassion, and the tantric master must be proficient in the production and usage of various tormas.

(7) The secret to chanting mantras

Chanting mantras, both verbally and mentally, that is, visualizing them revolving around his heart

Mantras include Vajra Mantra, Mind Mantra, and Wheel Mantra.

As a tantric master, in addition to knowing how to recite mantras, you must also master certain techniques of mantra recitation.

When reciting the vajra mantra, the breath and the mantra are indistinguishable.

For example, when you inhale it is "hum", when you hold it, it is "ah", and when you exhale it is "hum".

This is the Vajra Mantra.

Mindfulness mantra means reciting mantras with the heart, but not with the mouth.

The wheel mantra is the mantra wheel.

How to write it and how to visualize it must be very clear.

(8) Performing wrathful ritual procedures for forcefully catching the attention of the meditational deities and protectors 

These techniques refer to some methods of forcing achievement and elimination of obstacles.

(9) Consecrating images and statues 

There are many kinds of rituals for exorcising evil spirits, removing filth, contemplating Buddha, welcoming Buddha, making offerings, reciting mantra, transforming form, soothing the mind, consecrating light, blessing, scattering flowers and praying for blessings.

If there are stupas, halls, and statues that need consecration and blessing, as a Tantric Guru, you must be able to perform these rituals proficiently.

(10) Making mandala offerings, performing the meditational practices (sadhana) and taking self initiations

Mandala meditation offering refers to mastering how to meditate on the mandala of Wisdom Deity, Ultimate Bliss, etc., and how to make dedications after meditating.

55

The above are the ten inner secret methods. As a tantric master, you need to have these abilities and cultivation bases.


(10) Understand the mandala making method. 

Mandala is the pure land of the deity. There are many types of mandala: three-dimensional, colorful sand models, color drawings, artistic conception mandala and so on.

Some are drawn on paper and cloth, some are made of sand, and some are made of wood. You must understand how to write and make mandala.

The above are the ten inner secret methods. As a tantric master, you need to have these abilities and cultivation bases.

These are the techniques of the two sets of ten.

(11) Proficient in tantric practice 

As a Vajra Guru, one needs to be proficient in stages of teh Tantric path, tantric techniques, tantra's vital points of qi, secondary and other methods.

(12) Firm Belief

As a guru, these beliefs must be firm and unwavering.

(13) Pure at the root: 

Internal sense bases: Refers to the six senses: eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind.

56

External sense bases: 

Refers to the six external sense objects: visible objects or form, sound, smell, taste, touch, and menatl objects.

When the six sense organs correspond to the six sense domains in the external environment, if there is no obscuration, then the sense organs are purified.

When the eyes look at external objects, they do not have thoughts, and do not generate greed, hatred, and delusion; when the ears hear other people's scolding, they do not get angry, and when they hear praise, they do not become arrogant. 

---

These are the thirteen conditions that a master of tantric empowerment needs to meet.

#### Section 2 - Getting close to the guru

 After understanding the requirements for a guru, if you encounter a guru with these virtues, you should accept him as your guru, listen to the scriptures, listen to the Dharma, and study hard.

While you are studying, you may encounter many virtuous teachers. Should you follow only one guru and then practice meditation;
Or, if you meet a teacher, you should take refuge, and then rely on multiple teachers.

How do we make the choice?

Both Dromtönpa Gyelwé Jungné and Sangpowa (Ngog Legpai Sherab) were disciples of the Venerable Atisha, and they were outstanding in every aspect.

Master Dromtönpa was the main leader of the Kadam tradition. Master Sangpowa was a great translator and has made great contributions to the spread of Buddhism in Tibet, but the way they relied on their guru is completely different.

Master Sangpowa had many teachers, and when he heard that there were people teaching the Dharma, he would listen to them.

On the way to meet Venerable Atisha, he heard that a layman was teaching the Dharma nearby, and he also went to listen.

His disciples all thought that they should not go. The disciples said, "To listen to the layman's teachings with your prestige is simply to damage your reputation."

Master Sangpowa said: "You can't say that. At least if I listen to it, I will have the merit of hearing it and rejoicing."

On the other hand, Master Dromtönpa had only five teachers, two in India, three in Tibet, and after the age of thirty-nine, he only relied on the Venerable Atisha.

58

So, which master's way of following a teacher is preferable?

Once, when the two masters Potowa and Gombawa were together, they talked about this issue. In the end, they agreed that for disciples who are just starting out, because their troubles are still relatively heavy, they look at the faults of others more than their merits and still have not ddevloped enough confidence in their guru, and cannot develop the view that the guru is a buddha.

If you haven't developed enough confidence to see your teacher as a Buddha, you should learn Master Dromtönpa's way of relying, and it is better to have fewer teachers.

Now some people have followed many teachers, learned from everyone, listened to everyone's Dharma, and attended whenever they heard that there was an empowerment ceremony.

For beginners, doing this is actually a taboo, and makes it difficult to achieve any level of success.

Beginners should rely on only one or two masters, and study and practice in the order taught by the master. If the direction is right, the path will not go wrong.

1. How to get close to the guru 

After taking refuge in the guru, you must get close to him. First of all, you must understand the meaning of 'being close to' the guru.

Getting close to the guru mainly includes three aspects: making offerings to the guru, serving the guru, and following the teachings.

59

(1) Making Offerings to the Guru 

Offering is the most important method of accumulating merit, and making offerings to the Guru is especially extraordinary, since the Guru is the incarnation of the Buddhas and Tathagatas, and if you make an offering to the Guru, it will be the same as making offerings to all the Buddhas.

There are three types of offerings to the guru:

Offering of Wealth: 

All legally obtained wealth and items can be offered to the guru, but the giving should be done according to your own ability i.e. within your means.

Also, it is better if the offering is pleasing to the guru, and even better if the offering is made from among one's own beloved items.

This will also develop one's own equanimity and respect for the guru, and it is also a good way to obtain the guru's blessing.

Offerings of Body, speech, and mind: 

This means offering one's body, speech, and mind to the guru.

Offering body to the guru means, taking responsibility for doing thingsand undertaking the work; Offering speech to the guru means, offering prayers and praise; Offering mind to the guru means, in everything you think, be pure and respectful, and correspond with the teacher.

Offerings of Dharma: 

After receiving the tantric empowerments, you have already made samaya vows and precepts with your guru. Therefore, you should practice diligently in accordance with the Dharma, and use your practice knowledge and practical actions to benefit all sentient beings as offerings to your guru.

Among the three kinds of offerings, Dharma offerings are the most outstanding, body, speech, and mind offerings are second, and wealth offerings are the lowest.

60

(2) Serving the Guru 

Serving the Guru is actually a kind of offering of one's body, known as "cheng shi".

"Cheng" means to bear and accept responsibility; "things" include all the things, big and small, that the guru has asked you to do, including not only the great deeds of assisting the guru in spreading the Dharma and benefiting living beings, but also little things like serving at his side.

(3) Practice According to the Dharma

The purpose of practicing Buddhism according to the teaching is to get rid of all kinds of afflictions in oneself. In order to liberate oneself and become a Buddha, it this is also the reason for getting close to the master.

After making offerings to the guru, if you do not earnestly practice the Dharma taught by the guru, you will not be able to liberate yourself.

Therefore, it is very important to listen to the master's teaching and put it into practice.

In addition, if a disciple listens to the teacher's words, and practices according to the master's teaching, it is a very good way of making the guru happy.

##### 2. The merits of offering and serving

(1) The merits of making offerings to the guru 
 
To make offerings to the guru, you must first know the benefits of making offerings.

When you make offerings to the master, you make offerings to the Buddhas and Tathagatas.

In the Chakrasamvara Tantra, it says:

Live in the body of the teacher and accept the confession of believers.

What does it mean? This is to say that the Four Great Kings, such as Chakrasamvara, and the Buddhas and Tathagatas live in the body of the master and receive offerings from the disciples.

If a disciple makes offerings to the guru, it is equivalent to making offerings to the Four Great Kings, and thus making offerings to the Buddhas and Tathagatas.

When the guru accepts the offering, the Buddhas and Tathagatas receive the offering.

Therefore, making offerings to the guru is a great way to accumulate blessings.

If you only make offerings to Chakrasamvara, then you can only make offerings to one deity; 

if you make offerings to Buddha Shakyamuni, you can only make offerings to one Buddha;

if you make offerings to Amitabha, you also have the merits of making offerings to one Buddha.

However, if you make offerings to the guru, you will have the merit of making offerings to all the Buddhas and Tathagatas!

The "Sambhota Tantra" is a fundamental tantra of the Supreme Yoga of Tantra. In the "Sambhota Tantra", it says:

A single pore on the teacher's body, the merit surpasses the merits of making offerings to all Buddhas and Bodhisattvas in the ten directions.

This means that if you make an offering to a single pore on your guru, the merits and virtues will surpass that of making offerings to the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas of the ten directions.

For example, even rubbing a little oil on one of the pores of the guru's body is very beneficial.

There are many techniques for becoming a Buddha very quickly in the tantric method, and making offerings is one of them.

The offerings of tantra are mainly to make offerings to the guru, and if one makes offerings to the guru, one will make offerings to the Buddhas and Tathagatas.

The offerings of the Hinayana are mainly offerings to Shakyamuni Buddha, and the offerings of the Mahayana sects are to all Buddhas and Bodhisattvas. If you make offerings to a Buddha, you will only have the merits of making offerings to one Buddha; if you make offerings to a Bodhisattva, you will only have the merits of making offerings to a single Bodhisattva, and you will not make offerings to others. You will not accumulate the merits making offerings to all the Buddhas and Tathagatas.

##### (2) The merits of serving the guru. 

Whatever the guru wants to do, the disciples should help, the merit of serving the guru is also very, very great.

The Huayan Sutra says: 

Going to tutors and teachers, they should wish that all beings skillfully serve their teachers, and practice virtuous ways.

Venerable Atisha had many highly accomplished disciples, and there was one disciple named Anijang Qu Rinchen, who was an old man.

When he took His Holiness as a teacher, he felt that he was very old and could not learn much about the Dharma. It was enough to serve the teacher well. He had been serving His Holiness for 17 years.

Later, among the disciples, he had the highest concentration and understanding.

Geshe Gonpawa Wangchuk Gyeltsen once said:

"At that time, Ani served the guru, and Dromtönpa was the interpreter for the guru. I concentrated on practicing meditation, but later, both of them had higher concentration and understanding than me."

Geshe Sharawa dedicated himself to serving his guru Qin O Wa.

One time, he was cleaning the ashes. As he was carrying the ashes and was about to go downstairs to dump it, he suddenly realized all the essentials of the classics very clearly on the stairs, and he also had many magical abilities.

The Elegant Sayings written by Sakya Pandita says:

After several kalpas of ascetic practice of perfection of wisdom, giving of body, hands and feet,

The teacher's way is complete in an instant, and he is happy to follow the teacher's path.

When Sakya Pandita was a child, he followed his uncle Jetsün Drakpa Gyaltsen to learn the Dharma.

When asking for Guru Yoga, Jetsün Drakpa Gyaltsen said:

"I can't pass Guru Yoga on to you yet."

Sakya Pandita asked, "Why?"

Drakpa Gyaltsen said: "Because now you can only see me as an uncle, not as a Buddha or Bodhisattva. Without this belief, it is useless to pass on it."

Afterwards, one time, Master Drakpa Gyaltsen was ill, and Sakya Pandita also suffered from the cold. Drakpa Gyaltsen said, "I can't move. Please take good care of me for a while."

64

In this way, although Sakya Pandita himself was suffering, he still did his best to serve his guru.

Three months later, Drakpa Gyaltsen said, "I can teach you Guru Yoga. I got sick to eliminate karma for you. Now, your karma has been purified."

After teaching the Dharma, Sakya Pandita diligently practiced Guru Yoga, and soon became proficient in the Ten Great Dharmas, saw Manjushri Bodhisattva with his own eyes, and was personally blessed by the Bodhisattva.

In fact, Buddhas and Bodhisattvas are everywhere, but sentient beings cannot see them. Why? Because the karma of sentient beings is heavy!

Serving the guru can quickly eliminate karmic obstacles, and it is possible to see Buddhas and Bodhisattvas.

Serving a guru is a relatively easy way to achieve success.

When serving a guru, you should treat your master as a Buddha or a Bodhisattva, who has the power to give blessings. To treat the guru as if they were an ordinary person will not bring any power of blessing.

There is no Guru Yoga in Mahayana, only in Tantra.

The meaning of guru yoga is to visualize the indistinguishability of the guru and the Buddha, the indistinguishability of the guru and the Buddha Shakyamuni, and all the Buddhas and Tathagatas.

After contemplating in this way, since the guru is regarded as all the Buddhas and Tathagatas, if you offer a cup of water to the guru, it is equivalent to offering a cup of water to the Buddhas and Tathagatas, not just one or two Buddhas.

In this way, in the moment of making offerings, there will be great merit, and in the moment of practice, many karmic obstacles will be eliminated, and great merit will be accumulated.

65

Therefore, the Dharma door of Tantra is very special.

Mahayana does not have such a method.

In the sutras, if making offerings to Amitabha Buddha, only Amitabha Buddha will receive the offerings. 

If making offerings to Shakyamuni Buddha, only Shakyamuni Buddha will receive the offerings.

If you want to make offerings to the Buddhas and Tathagatas, you must make offerings one by one.

Therefore, under normal circumstances, if you want to accumulate great blessings in the practice of Theravada or Sutra, you must go through ascetic practice.

It is only possible after going through a lot of ascetic practices, even giving one's own body to all beings.

Guru Yoga, a tantric practice, does not need to go through ascetic practices, and it can also accumulate great blessings and eliminate many karmic obstacles.

##### (3) The attitude of serving the guru 

When serving the guru, it will be more complete if you follow the "Nine Attitudes of Devotion to the Guru" as stated in the Huayan Sutra.

The Nine Attitudes are:

1. Like a filial child. 

Like a filial child, one thoroughly carries out the instructions of the Guru without the slightest deviation.

2. Like a Vajra. 

Like a Vajra that cannot be split apart, even when facing division created by devils or bad associates, one will never split away from the Guru.

3. Like the Earth. 

Like the Earth carrying everything in the world, one shoulders all assignments ordered by the Guru.

4. Like an Iron Circle of Mountains.

Like everlasting mountains, while abiding under the patronage of the Guru one endures hardships and sufferings without ever swaying in one’s determination.

5. Like a servant. 

Like an obedient servant, even when one is obliged to carry out very difficult assignments one holds no grudges in one’s heart.

6. Like a sweeper. 

Like a humble sweeper, one renounces self-pride and regards oneself as inferior to the Guru.

7. Like a rope. 

Like a continuous rope, one rejoices in carrying on the Dharma activities of the Guru, regardless of its degree of difficulty and heaviness of load.

8. Like a domestic dog. 

Like a loyal dog, even when the Guru ridicules, irritates or ignores one, one never responds with anger.

9. Like a boat. 

Like a ferry one goes back and forth on the Guru’s assignments without any discontent.

The "filial son" here is translated as "Shunzi" in Tibetan, and the word "shun" is highlighted, which means to obey the master's will.

66

Because people nowadays have strong ego-clinging, they are used to everything being centered on themsleves, and believe they can do whatever they want.

To follow the guru, one must throw away the ego and serve the guru like a filial son serves his parents.

When a dutiful son in ancient times wanted to do something, he would not do it according to his own ideas, but to observe his parents. If the parents were happy, he would do it, and if they were not happy, he would not do it.

The same is true when doing things for the guru. You must first observe the guru's face before making a decision.

Sometimes, it is not easy for the guru to speak directly about what the disciple is going to do, or it is inconvenient to say it at the time. At this time, if he sees that the guru is very happy, he approves; Whatever you say, don't stick to your own ideas.

It is also stated in the King of Samdhi Sutra:

Students who rely properly on the teacher should always give up their self-assertiveness and instead act in accordance with the will of the teacher.

On this point, Master Tsongkhapa especially reminded us: 

To act according to the will of the master does not mean that it must be done in front of any master, but must be in front of a master with virtue.

If the other party is not a real virtuous teacher, he cannot be led by the nose.

67

Vajra Heart 

The attitude which is like a diamond. This means to make the relationship between teacher and student close and stable.

The heart of relying on the guru is the vajra heart that never changes.
After relying on the guru, the heart of being close to the guru must never be shaken, and it should be as firm and indestructible as a vajra.

"not to be split apart by anyone—demons, bad friends, and the like."

Whether it is a "demon" who destroys the Dharma-connection, learning and practice, or a bad friend who slanders the teacher and disparages the Dharma, none of them can destroy or shake the relationship between oneself and the teacher, leading to separation from the teacher.

"Magic" here refers to those who hinder study.

The scriptures say: 

"And forsake fickleness in close relationships and changeability in facial expressions."

That is to say, in order to take into account the relationship and affection of some friends, you cannot follow them and prevent yourself from relying on your guru.

The center of the earth can carry anything, it can carry high-rise buildings, it can carry people and animals, it can also carry trees.

Whatever the guru has to do, as a disciple, you should have the courage to undertake it, that is, the "earth heart" that bears heavy responsibilities and hard work.

The earth's heart includes six aspects. Since you have made up your mind to take responsibility for your guru, you must do it from six aspects:

(1) Mountain Heart

The heart of the mountain is widely known as the heart of the Lunwei Mountain, and the Lunwei Mountain is the Tiewei Mountain.

The Circling Iron Mountains firmly surround the saltwater sea in the center, and the monstrous waves of the saltwater sea cannot shake or destroy the Tiewei Mountain.

At the end of time, the great fire that can destroy all things cannot burn the Iron Mountain, and violent storms are even less likely to shake the Iron Mountain.

Here, the mountain heart is used as a metaphor for the kind of perseverance that a disciple will never give up under any pressure or tribulation when he undertakes heavy responsibilities for the master.

(2) Servant's heart 

If what the guru instructs to do is relatively simple, thinking that it is beneath you, you shouldn't feel embarrassed or hesitate, and just do it decisively, that is the servant's heart.

Once, for example, the scholar Atisha and all his translators had to stay in Tsang in an area of sewage and mud. Geshe Drom-dòn-ba took off all his clothes and cleaned up the filth. He covered the area with dry white earth, from where no one knows. He even built a [stone and earth] mandala in front of the Elder Atisha.

His Holiness was very happy when he saw it, smiled and said, "It's rare to find people like you in India, but in Tibet it is very rare."

 "Ah-ray! I had one like you in India, too." 

In fact, Dromtonpa could instruct others to do the dirty work, but he still did it himself.

That is to say, when serving the guru, as long as it can benefit the guru, no matter whether it is big or small, honourable or disgraceful, you must do your best.

69

(3) an attitude like a sweeper 

Means to eliminate completely all pride and feelings of superiority, and consider yourself to be lower than your guru.

The people of the lower class are the people of the heart, which is widely called "the removal of the unclean people".

India has a caste system. This kind of people is a lower caste. Because they have lived at the bottom of the society for generations, they are very humble.

The subordination of the human heart means that when doing things for the guru, one should be respectful and not have any thoughts of "arrogance" and "too slow", and always maintain a humble attitude to serve the guru.

Master Dromtonpa said: 

"The water of good qualities does not collect on the heights of pride."

It means that arrogance is like the top of a mountain and cannot accumulate merit water.

Jen-nga-wa also said: 

"In the planting time of spring, look at whether the green growth comes from the high mountain peaks or from the low valleys."

It means that in early spring, looking at the tops of the mountains and valleys, the grass that grows first in the low-lying areas, and then slowly grows to the top of the mountain.

Therefore, it is said that only by being humble and low can you grow your merits. If I am slow to pay tribute to the higher, not only do I have no merits, but there are also faults.

(4) an attitude like a foundation, means to take on even the heavy responsibilities of the most arduous activities of your guru with pleasure. 

70

Even if the task that the master asks to be done is very arduous, the responsibility is heavy, and it is beyond one's own ability, like a carriage that can bear the load, he must bravely undertake it, take it all down, and then find a way to complete it.

To be able to take on heavy responsibilities and to be the backbone of the master's preaching of the Dharma is the attitude of the cart.

(5) an attitude like a dog, means not to get angry even when your guru despises or berates you.  

A righteous dog can endure humiliation and does not abandon his master, just like a righteous dog that never leaves its master.

Here is how to deal with the scolding of the guru.

When a disciple has made a big mistake, and the master to scolds him, it is actually a good thing. If the master simply speaks nicely the disciple may not listen to it, and will mistakenly regard the fault as a merit.

The teacher's scolding is a blessing. It should not be simply considered that the teacher lost his temper, nor that he is angry. As a disciple, you must have such wisdom.

There is a sentence in the "Perfection of Wisdom in Eight Thousand Lines", which is translated into modern language: 

Even if the instructors of the teachings seem to despise and to ignore those who want their teachings, do not challenge them. 

Persist tirelessly and respectfully, and diligently seek the teachings. 

Because the connection to the Dharma is difficult to obtain, sometimes the guru does not teach the Dharma. It may be due to the fact that the disciple’s current blessings are not enough, and the required vows cannot be kept. At this time, the disciple must understand the guru and act according to the teacher's will.

71

(6) 

The heart of sailing the boat is not tired of doing anything for the guru, and is not afraid of trouble. This is the heart of sailing the boat.

No matter how heavy, numerous, troublesome, or repeated things the guru instructs you to do, you must persevere as a disciple, and you can't get bored or complain.

According to the biography of Venerable Milarepa, Guru Marpa asked Milarepa to build a house, and that he had to do it alone. No one else was allowed to help.

When it was about to be finished, Marpa immediately pointed out the faults and asked him to dismantle it. After dismantling, he also asked him to put all the stones back in their original place and arrange them properly.

It was built and demolished in this way, and it was demolished and built again. After going back and forth, I don’t know how many times, Milarepa  wore out his back by carrying the stones, and his bones were exposed.

But Milarepa persisted in this way, and thus eliminated the karma of killing thirty-five people and horses through black magic in the past in order to avenge his parents. He reached great enlightenment and became a Buddha in his lifetime.

The meaning of the heart of sailing is the same. The ship is loaded with goods and comes and goes at sea, constantly loading and unloading.

The disciple's commitment to the master should be like a sailing ship, not afraid of repetition, not bored, not complaining, and willing to bear everything.

72

Master Tsongkhapa simply divided the nine attitudes into four parts: 

The first part, when getting along with the teacher, pay attention to observe and understand the teacher's will, and obey the teacher's will, which is the heart of filial piety.

The second part, after relying on the guru, pay attention to cherish and protect the relationship with the guru, so as not to be damaged by the alienation of those who slander the master and disparage the Dharma. This is the vajra heart.

The third part is to respect the master's cause of spreading the Dharma and benefiting sentient beings, to undertake all the important responsibilities for the master, to keep working and never slack off. This is the earth's heart.

In the fourth part, the earth heart is divided into six areas: The unshakable belief in doing things for the guru is the mountain heart.

When doing things, no matter how big or the small, being able to do it yourself is the servant's heart.

To be humble and low-key when doing things is to be down-to-earth.

Being able to shoulder heavy responsibilities when doing things is the heart of the cart.

To be able to endure the master's scolding when doing things is a righteous dog's heart.

Being able to do things without fear of trouble and repetition is the heart of sailing.

When serving the guru, use the nine attitudes to observe, compare and guide yourself, the merit will be great, the blessing will be great, and progress will be faster.

73

#### 3. The merits of piety and devotion 

There are three kinds of merits of piety and devotion to the guru: natural blessing; spontaneous understanding; accelerated achievement.

(1) Naturally, if you are sincere and devoted to your guru, you will naturally receive the blessings of your guru and all the Buddhas and Tathagatas.

Master Potowa has a book called "The Blue Treasure Book", which is the most famous work of the Kadam School. 

The "Blue Treasure Book" says:

The extent of the guru's blessing is not the guru's own.

What is the size of the Guru's blessing? 

It mainly depends on the devotion of the disciple.

If the devotion of the disciple is very great, the blessing of the guru will be very great, and the blessing of the Buddhas and Tathagatas will be very great.

If the devotion of the disciple is not enough, he will not be able to receive the blessing of the master. Even if the master is the incarnation of Manjushri Bodhisattva or Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva, it is useless, and it is useless for Buddha Shakyamuni to speak the scriptures personally.

The greater the devotion, the greater the blessing.

The Five Kagyu Laws also say:

On the four-body snow-capped mountain of the master, if the sunshine of devotion does not shine,

The nectar of blessings will not flow out, and you should make more efforts in devotion and vows.

It shows that the strength of the disciple's blessing from the guru depends entirely on the strength of the disciple's devotion and vows, that is, the strength of devotion to the guru and the strength of the will to pray for the guru's blessing.

(2) Self-awareness

1. With a devout teacher, faith gives birth to understanding

The real truth must be comprehended, but understanding it is not enough. Only after understanding it can it really work.

Knowing and realizing are different. With knowing you only gained the wisdom of hearing, with realizing you have obtained the wisdom of thinking, and with real understanding you have obtained the wisdom of experience.

For example, we all know the suffering of the six realms of rebirth, and we understand the impermanence of life, but we still have a lot of troubles in our hearts, why?

Because we only understand those truths on the surface, but we haven't deeply realized and experienced them in our heart.

For another example, if we realize the suffering of change within the three types of sufferings, we can truly feel the suffering of being without support, and realize that apart from Buddhas and Bodhisattvas, everything else is unreliable.

At this time, if someone does something against their own will, you will not be troubled or suffer, but you will realize that people and things in the world are like this, and they are inherently unreliable, so why bother?

In this way, you can truly let go of your worries.

With piety and devotion to the guru, your understanding will naturally increase, and you will realize many truths, until you realize emptiness of inherent self in human beings.

In addition, if the disciple's devotion is great, and the confidence in the master is high, understanding will naturally arise, and understanding will be enhanced.

The Kagyu Master Guocangwa has achieved very high achievements. He said:

High faith and aspiration, brings high comprehension, medium faith and aspiration, brings medium comprehension,

If the power of faith is low, understanding will be low. 

Correct faith is very important.

If you have high faith and aspiration, your comprehension will naturally improve. In the end, your comprehension will be very high, you will realize a lot of truth, and you will eliminate a lot of troubles.

For example, a water glass, once you realize its true nature, you will not be trouble by the water glass breaking, and will not be attached to it.

Master Gyalwa Wensapa (1505–66) was an important patriarch of the Gelugpa school. He achieved enlightenment in one brief lifetime like the famous yogi Milarepa. Unlike Milarepa, Gyalwa Wensapa achieved enlightenment without having to endure such hardship. 

Master Wensapa said:

The high and low levels of enlightenment and awakening depend entirely on the power of meditation, faith, and aspiration.

76

This is the experience of Master Wensapa, which shows that the key to the master's achievement is that through meditation on the power of faith and aspiration to the master, the understanding is improved, and the achievement is achieved.

The Seventh Dalai Lama also said:

To promote the realization of achievement, the guru's blessing is the most powerful, 

This in turn relies on the power of faith and vow, because prayers must be made sincerely.

In a word, the greater the faith in the guru, the greater the blessing; the greater the blessing, the greater the understanding; the greater the understanding, the greater the achievement.

Therefore, the power of faith and aspiration triggered by devotion to the guru is the secret to generating enlightenment. If the power of faith and aspiration reaches a certain level, it will naturally induce a sense of enlightenment.

##### 2. If the power of faith and aspiration is high，there is merit of understanding

Nagarjuna Bodhisattva had five disciples, one of whom was named Longbodhi, who has great faith in Nagarjuna Bodhisattva.

Once, Nagarjuna Bodhisattva was tired and spit out some saliva. Longbodhi immediately took it with his hands and ate it as the nectar blessed by the Bodhisattva. His comprehension improved immediately, and he realized emptiness the next day.

This is the behavior of a person with a very strong faith and pure motive. If the faith and will is not at this level, it is useless to do so.

77

Once, Naropa was walking with his master Tilopa, and Tilopa brought Naropa to a tomb, and there was a dead body in the tomb, and Tilopa brought the rotten head of the corpse, put it in a skull-cap, handed it to Naropa and said, "If you have enough faith in me, you can eat it, and if you don't have enough faith, don't eat it."

Master Naropa's faith and devotion to  Master Tilopa was very great, so he ate it and achieved enlightenment in his lifetime.

There are some Buddhists in Tibet who take away the water that the master used to wash his feet and face, and use it to wash their own face and bathe, hoping to get the blessing of the master.

It is not impossible to do this, but it depends on whether the devotion, faith and aspiration to the guru are strong enough. If it is not strong enough, it will not work. If it is strong enough, these things can improve the understanding.

(3) Accelerated achievement 

Respecting the guru with devotion will accelerate achievement, and achievement will come sooner.

Master Tilopa said:

---

That is, the body achieves the vajra practice,

The ultimate way is the way of the gurus,

The highest faith in the guru.

By honouring the guru with the highest faith, the achievement will continue to improve.

---

The supreme belief is to see the guru as a real Buddha, a living Buddha.

When one's belief is raised to this level, one can get great blessings quickly, and it will be accomplished very quickly.

Even just visualizing the guru without practicing the Dharma can bring success.

Master Yanggongpa (Gyalwa Yungtonpa), a very accomplished guru of the Kagyu school, said:

---

The master does not teach a single sentence of the Dharma, 

the disciple does not meditate once,

and once he becomes a Buddha, 
 
he believes in the master's path.

---

That is to say, when the devotion of the disciple is so great that he can see that the teacher is a real Buddha, a living Buddha, even if he does not meditate or recite sutras, he will achieve success.

Guru is Buddha! 

A master is a living Buddha! 

It is very, very important to cultivate and consolidate this belief!

**4. The merits of shaping the image of the guru** 

In Atisha's Continuity of Form ", it says:

To build an image of a guru, the merit is far better than,

To make countless images for countless Buddhas.

It shows that the merits and virtues of sculpting the statue of the guru are far greater than the merits and virtues of sculpting countless Buddha statues.

Offering a photo or image of the guru has the same merit.

Reverently sculpting the image of the guru is the same as sculpting the statues of Buddhas and Tathagatas. It is amazing. For example, offering a photo of a guru is equivalent to offering images of Buddhas and Tathagatas, but it must be an image of one’s own guru to have such merit. Because this is the origin of the heart-to-heart connection between the master and the disciple, and it is a very special origin.

When Master Tsongkhapa built Ganden Monastery, most of the Buddha statues and mandala were ready, only the Buddha statue in the middle of the hall had not been built.

Master Tsongkhapa said: 

"Disciples, it is up to you to build this Buddha statue."

The disciples had a discussion: 

What is the best way to build this most important Buddha statue? Finally, all the disciples agreed to build a statue of Shakyamuni Buddha.

At this time, both Sera Monastery and Drepung Monastery chose the image of Master Tsongkhapa as the main Buddha statue in the centre of the hall.

After the Buddha statues of the three major monasteries were all built, Master Tsongkhapa said: 

"It is very good to build the Buddha statue of Sakyamuni in Ganden Monastery, but Drepung Monastery and Sera Monastery built statues of me. In the future, the Dharma relationship of Ganden Monastery will be inferior to that of Sera Monastery and Drepung Monastery.”

Later, it turned out to be the case. Ganden Saichi was the throne of Master Tsongkhapa. Those who sat in this position were equivalent to the leaders of the Gelug school. All the best teachers from the three monasterieswere there. Most of them came from Sera Monastery and Drepung Monastery. Yes, there were very few from Ganden Monastery, because of the origin of the statue of the master.

80

The origin of the statue of the guru is very good, and the statue of the guru is the statue of the Buddha.

Therefore, in the Great Sutra Hall of Tuole Temple, there are statues of Dharma King Yongzeng, Jiayang Xieba, and many teachers.

**5. The merits of thinking about and praying to the guru**

(1) Remembering the merits of the guru

Thinking of the guru is better than thinking of the Buddhas. 

The merit of thinking of the master is to visualize the merit of the Buddhas and Tathagatas, and it is to visualize the merits of the perssonal deity.
Sometimes, if it is difficult to visualize the deity, just visualize the guru.

The Canon of Oaths says:

81
>
>Years and years of doing meditation on the development or completion stages,
>
>or years and years of chanting mantras, 
>
>cannot compare with one instant of remembering the guru.
>

This means that contemplating the Buddha's thirty-two and eighty-sixty marks, or the marks of a bodhisattva or deity for 100,000 kalpas, is the same as thinking of the guru for a moment.

Therefore, the merit of remembering the guru is very, very great! Many people say, "I can't visualize the deity, nor can I visualize Shakyamuni Buddha."

In this case, it is enough to visualize the guru.

Sometimes it's a little more difficult to visualize the guru, and that's due to karma.

When some people meditate on the guru, they can't remember what they think. Even if the guru has just given them an empowerment, they forget the guru's face. This is because their karma is relatively heavy.

In terms of practice, contemplating the practice of the master is better than practicing Tantra, the second Drukpa master Gotsangpa Gonpo Dorje (rgod tshang pa mgon po rdo rje, 1189-1258) said:

Although there are many stages of generation, the method of visualizing the master is the best.

It is also stated in the Atisha Form Continuation:

Give up sleep and hustle and bustle,

and meditate on the path of perfection through eons.

No more than an instant in my mind, visualize the tenth of the masters.

Whether our practice can be successful or not depends on two aspects. The first aspect is to see if one has achieved Guru Yoga, and is able to visualize that the Guru and the Buddha as indistinguishable. When there is a belief in the mind that "the guru and the Buddha are indistinguishable", the achievement will be very fast.

The second aspect is to practice the second stage of Tantra on the basis of the achievement of Guru Yoga, so that one can quickly become a Buddha.

At this time, if you visualize any deity, such as Hayagrīvag, as long as you visualize the same as the master, there will be blessings, and there will be two kinds of blessings, immense and quick.

If we only have faith in Buddhas and Bodhisattvas, due to our heavy karma, no matter how great the blessings of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas are, it will be difficult for us to obtain them, and enlightenment will be slow.

For future rebirths, it is easier to be reborn in the Pure Land when you think of your guru. The merits of thinking of your guru are very, very great, especially when you are dying. If you can think of your guru, you will definitely be reborn in the Pure Land. This is 100% sure!

The tantra classic "The Good Army Request Tantra" says: 

"When a person is dying, he can transfer his consciousness to a better rebirth when he thinks of his teacher."

Buddhist practitioners, if they do not achieve enlightenment in this life, when they die, no matter how heavy their karma is, as long as they can remember their guru, and through the power of faith in the guru's Three Jewels, they will surely be able to transfer their consciousness to a better rebirth. Outstanding.

Tibetan Buddhism has the Powa method of transferring consciousness to rebirth, and the Chinese have the method of reciting Amitabha Buddha, but if you don’t accumulate a certain amount of merit, you may not be able to successfully be reborn in the Pure Land, because when the bad karma is too heavy, you will be drawn by the bad karma and will fall into evil realms.

Therefore, by relying on oneself one may not really be able to be reborn in the Pure Land.

However, when you are dying, if you can really think of your guru and yearn for your guru, you will definitely be reborn in the Pure Land!

In terms of living, it is easier to think of the guru whenever you wish. If you think of your guru often, your life will be as wishful and easy to accomplish.

The Tibetan version of the Huayan Sutra says:

If you always keep the teacher in mind, 

Everything will be easy to accomplish.

The same is true for the cause of Buddhism. If you miss your guru often, you will easily get the blessings of the Buddhas and Tathagatas.

Master Tsangpa Gyarepa once said:

As long as the mind does not leave the teacher,

Even if you don't read scriptures,

Even if you don't know how to meditate.

As long as you think of your guru, 

you will be successful if you don't read sutras or meditate.

Because only through the guru can the blessings of the Buddhas and Tathagatas be obtained, and because of this dependent origin, as long as the mind does not leave the guru, one can always obtain the blessings of the Buddhas and the Tathagatas.

84

#### (2) Praying for the guru's merits

Often praying to the guru, such as reciting the guru's prayer, the merit is also very, very great.

Because reciting the guru's prayer is the same as reciting the prayers of the Buddhas and Tathagatas, so there is such a great merit.

Master Gotsangpa Gonpo Dorje (rgod tshang pa mgon po rdo rje, 1189-1258) said that it is better to pray to the master once than to recite the mantra thousands of times.

Reciting the guru's prayer once is the same as reciting the mantra thousands of times.

We can also recite Master Tsongkhapa's prayer (Migstema):

---
>
>Objectless compassion, Chenrezig,
>
>Lord of stainless wisdom, Manjushri,
>
>Conquering mara’s hordes, Vajrapani,
>
>Crown jewel of the Sages of the Land of Snows, Tsongkhapa,
>
>Lobsang Drakpa, at your feet, I pray.
>

---

Frequently reciting the prayer of Master Tsongkhapa will have the merits of reciting the prayers of all Buddhas, Tathagatas, lineage masters, and root masters. It is very, very special.

85

**6. The merits of reverence for the Buddha** 

(1) The guru is Buddha according to the scriptures, and all masters with virtue are the manifestations of all Buddhas and Bodhisattvas.

For example, in the "Heap of Jewels Sutra: The Meeting of fathers and Sons", the Buddha said:

After I attain Nirvana, I shall transform into the body of a guru to benefit all sentient beings.

...

When I appear in the body of a master, I also appear in the form of birth, old age, sickness and death.

"Second Observation Continuation" says:

At the end of the Dharma, I am now a master.

The Vajra Sutra says:

At the end of the turbid world, I appeared as a good teacher and spoke.

The Vajra Body Tantra says:

Originally a Vajrasattva, for the benefit of all sentient beings, 

he is now an ordinary teacher.

86

...

For the last five hundred kalpas, 

I am now the master,

Treat it as a vajra holding and treat it with respect.

Before the Buddhas became Buddhas,

In order to become a Buddha, 

one must make a vow,

Only when the willpower is mature,

to become a Buddha.

For example, making a vow: 

"After I become a Buddha in the future, 

I will save all sentient beings."

Therefore, after becoming a Buddha, he will surely come to help us.

When the blessings of human beings are very great, the Buddha can manifest himself in person to save sentient beings; when the blessings of people are small and greed, hatred and delusion are very great, even if the Buddha appears, sentient beings will not be able to see him.

So, what method is used to save sentient beings? The Buddha merged into the body of the master to save sentient beings.

Many times, the Buddhas and Tathagatas merge into the body of the guru, or transform into the image of the guru to save sentient beings.

Therefore, the disciple should regard the guru as the Buddha.

Treat your guru as a Buddha and you will receive the blessing of a Buddha; Treat him as a Bodhisattva, you will receive the blessing of a Bodhisattva; Treat him as an ordinary person, and you will have no blessing, because ordinary people cannot give blessings.

Some people have several masters. We are not sure whether these masters are all Buddhas, but according to Buddhist scriptures and tantras, due to the bodhisattva's vow to become a Buddha, at least one Buddha will be integrated into the master. Physically, that's for sure.

As for which Buddha was integrated into the guru, or the body of which guru the Buddha integrated into, it is not certain.

87

Therefore, if we treat all the teachers we have taken refuge with as Buddhas, we will surely receive the blessings of the Buddhas and Tathagatas.

Sometimes, it is necessary to regard teachers as incarnations of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas, and the merits of such visualization are even greater.

(2) The Buddhist scriptures on merit and virtue as viewed by the Buddha

 say: Believe in refuge is inconceivable, 
 
 and its retribution is also inconceivable.

To believe is to believe sincerely.

It means that the power of the Three Jewels of Believing in the Guru is incredible, and the good deeds and blessings obtained are also inconceivable.

Because the Buddha is inconceivable, the results obtained by taking the guru as a Buddha and taking refuge with devotion are also inconceivable.

From this point of view, it is very important to take refuge and regard the guru and the Buddha as one and the same.

There is a biography called "Jinwen Dawa Biography", which tells about the incarnation of Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva. 

The biography says:

With one heart and one mouth, 

he regards the master as one Buddha, one body.

All good virtues develop the power,

and all the disciples of the Buddha practice the Way together.

It means: to cultivate the heart of devation and refuge in the guru to the extent that it is consistent with the heart.

When we praise the guru as a Buddha in our speech, and see the guru as a Buddha in our heart, we see that the guru and the Buddha are indistinguishable.

88

It is also stated in the Vajra Hand Empowerment Tantra:

Benefit all sentient beings, 

he is the Buddha,

With this thought in mind, 

all good things will arise.

Guru Marpa was studying in the Hevajra deity. One morning, while Guru Marpa was still sleeping, his master, Master Naropa, manifested Hevajra in the sky, and then woke Guru Marpa. Said: 

"Get up now and go outside and have a look."

Master Marpa went out and looked, and said, "It's nothing.

Master Naropa said: 

"Look into the sky. "

Master Marpa looked into the sky and saw Hevajra.

Master Naropa asked Guru Marpa, 

"If you want to bow down, do you want to bow down to me or the Hevajra first?"

Master Marpa thought: 

"The teacher is always in front of me, and there are many opportunities to bow to the teacher, but there are not many opportunities to bow to Hevajra. 

I want to bow to Hevajra."

Master Marpa bowed to Hevajra three obeisances.

So, Master Naropa said, "Without a guru, there would be no Buddha, Bodhisattva, or yidam.

Buddhas, bodhisattvas, and yidams are all transformed and manifested by a guru."

After he finished speaking, he took back Hevajra and dissolved it into his heart.

Then he said to Master Marpa, "In the future, the lineage of your descendants will not last long.

This morning, if you had bowed to your guru first, the continuation of the lineage of your descendants would have been very good, but you didn't. "

It turned out to be so.

Guru and Buddhas and Bodhisattvas are indistinguishable, and when one bows to the master, one bows to the Buddhas and Tathagatas.

When Guru Marpa bowed to the Hevajra, he did not necessarily bow to Naropa, but if he had bowed to Naropa, he would also have been bowing to Hevajra.

When we cultivate Vajrasattva, we must visualize that Vajrasattva is indistinguishable from the guru, and indistinguishable from the Buddhas, Tathagatas, and the four deities.

With this state of mind, reciting the hundred-syllable mantra once is equivalent to reciting the mantras of the Buddhas and Tathagatas, and is equivalent to reciting the heart mantras and fundamental mantras of the four deities.

If you don't have this attitude, you won't have so much merit when reciting the hundred-syllable mantra.

There are many kinds of Guru Yoga: 

Guru Yoga of Avalokitesvara is to visualize the teacher and Avalokitesvara as indistinguishable; Guru Yoga of Manjushri is to visualize the Guru and Manjushri as indistinguishable; Master Tsongkhapa's guru yoga is to visualize that the guru and Tsongkhapa are indistinguishable.

In any kind of guru yoga, the guru, the Buddha and Bodhisattvas must be regarded as indistinguishable, and the guru and the deities are indistinguishable.

When practicing the deity (yidam), in order to obtain the corresponding benefit, you also need to first practice guru yoga.

Vajrapani Bodhisattva once said to Master Nanka Gyaltsen:

90

"You should know that you have not yet cultivated great respect for your guru, 

but you are lying when you say that you have seen the deity in person and that understanding has arisen in your heart... 

Relying on your guru, you should treat your guru like a Buddha with confidence."

Therefore, we must understand that all the deities we meditate on are the manifestations of our masters. If we can’t cultivate in accordance with our masters, how can we correspond to deities? Only by practicing Guru Yoga and practicing the deity can you achieve rapid enlightenment.

The first emphasis of tantric practice is to take refuge in the guru and the Three Jewels. If there is no faith in the guru as a Buddha, the practice of tantra will not be successful.

The blessing of the master is like an iron hook, and the disciple's faith and vows are like an iron ring. Without this ring, the iron hook cannot catch onto anything.

(3) The merits and virtues of the Buddha's reverence include the reverence of body, speech and mind.

Physical reverence includes prostration, bowing, and reverence in actions and behaviors when in contact with the guru; verbal reverence includes admiration and praise of the teacher’s virtue on all occasions, as well as reverence in words when talking with the guru.

Respect includes respect and love for the guru from the heart, and an attitude of love and respect for the guru by sincerely taking refuge in the guru.

Since the guru is the incarnation of the Buddhas and Tathagatas, if you pay homage to the guru, you will have the merit of respecting all the Buddhas, and you will be able to accumulate a huge amount of merit.

91

In particular, if you can develop pure faith in ordinary teachers and pay homage to the Buddha, in addition to increasing blessings, you can also get many incredible merits such as the mutual help of humans and gods.

Respecting the guru with body, speech, and mind is the source of all good virtues.

92

#### Section 3 - Sins of Disrespecting the Guru 

Not respecting the Guru is not respecting the Buddhas and Tathagatas, which is a very serious fault.

After taking a teacher, one must respect the teacher and do what the teacher says; do not disobey the teacher, let alone slander and disparage the teacher.

Once a master-disciple relationship is established, if you have doubts about your guru, or have other impure thoughts or words and deeds, it can bring very serious evil karma.

Especially after receiving the tantric empowerments, if you don't respect the guru, you will not only violate the tantric precepts, but also go to hell, and you will not be able to achieve liberation even after countless kalpas.

The sin of disrespecting the guru is divided into three aspects: body, speech, and mind.

1. The sins of the body include the sins of disrespecting the guru, including disrespecting the shadow of the guru.

If you step on the guru's shadow with malice, it is equivalent to destroying a stupa.

In other respects, it is also a great sin to sit on the guru's cushion, throne, or to step on the guru's robe or bedding without permission.

93

In the past, there were minor living Buddhas who were mistakenly identified in Tibet and were placed on the cushions of the large living Buddhas who had passed away. Because the blessings were not enough, it was also very pitiful.

2. The guilt of speech 

The guilt of speech includes two parts: slandering the teacher and disobeying the teacher.

No matter what the reasons are, the consequences of slandering and disparaging the master are extremely serious. The result is that even the Buddha cannot bear to listen, and future rebirths will definitely bring you into the endless hell.

In the Vajrapani Empowerment Sutra, Vajrapani asked the Buddha, 

"Bhagavan, if there are those who despise Acharya, how familiar should they feel?"

The Buddha replied: 

"Vajrapani, don't speak like that, all the gods in the human world are terrifying! 

The Bhagavan, of course, should say a little:

Warriors should listen carefully, I say there is no time to wait,

The hells of extreme suffering are where they are born,

Going there for boundless kalpas, therefore all species,

The teacher should not be underestimated,…”

The Buddha considered that if he answered Vajrapani in detail, it would cause great terror to all beings in the world, so he only said roughly that he would need to stay in the endless hell for many years.

94

Therefore, under no circumstances should one despise or slander the guru.

Not only can you not despise and slander your guru yourself, but it is also not good to keep contact and talk with those who slander your guru.

Even those who disparage the guru in dreams will be regarded as unlucky.

As the tantra says:

Don't say anything to destroy the teacher, you don't want to see it in your dreams.

It was also said: 

"Those who slander the guru will not only fail to practice tantra, but also their best friends will fail to achieve success."

Therefore, not only can you not make friends with people who detract from your guru, but you will also be affected by their evil spirits even if you approach them.

One must be careful when contacting fellow Vajra brothers. Even if he is a good friend, if you find out that he has slandered or disrespected the guru, you should persuade him with kind words and ask him to go to the guru to repent immediately, or stay away from him if you cannot persuade him.

Above all, don't destroy your own life by failing to make up your mind just because everyone has a good relationship.

(1) The sin of slandering the guru

Slandering the guru is the crime of disparaging all the Buddhist scriptures that say:

For his savior, if his disciples slander him,

Because of slandering the Buddhas, other people suffer a lot.

95

The guru is the savior who frees sentient beings from the suffering of samsara. To slander the guru is to slander the Buddhas and Tathagatas.

Buddhas and Tathagatas transform into ready-made masters, or merge with masters to save sentient beings. They are the greatest and most profound fields of blessing for sentient beings.

To make offerings to one master is to make offerings to all Buddhas, and to slander one master is to slander all Buddhas. This kind of bad karma will lead to all kinds of misfortunes, diseases, and disasters.

Slandering the guru, training in tantric methods cannot be done. Some people worship the guru and participate in the empowerment, and then find fault with the guru on the way back home. This is a very, very sinful act!

Once you have a teacher, you cannot scold or slander him.

If you want to scold or slander your guru, don't take refuge in that guru in the first place.

Slandering the guru, for example, if the guru has a hot temper, gets angry every day, and you say that the guru is greedy, looks undignified, does things unfairly, etc. This is a great sin!

Those who have committed the five unrelenting sins have very heavy karma, and they will not be able to achieve the practice the Hinayana method, and it will be even more difficult to practice the method of the Mahayana.

If you practice tantra and have enough devotion to your guru, you can eliminate these sins and even achieve enlightenment in a lifetime.

96

However, those who slander, criticise and scold the guru will not be able to achieve anything by cultivating! The "Dense Vajra Root Tantra" says:

Although the world has committed all kinds of sins that are inexhaustible and degenerate,

In the great ocean of the Vajrayana, cultivating and realizing this path will be accomplished,

Those who deliberately slander the guru will not succeed in cultivation.

It means that even those who have committed the five unrepentant sins can practice Tantra.

However, those who deliberately slander the guru will not succeed in cultivation.

In "Vajra Heart To Be Solemn" it says:

If one slanders the guru, 

although diligence is the best,

Let go of sleep disorder, and diligently cultivate in a thousand kalpas,

Also repair hell.

That is to say, if someone slanders his master, even if he did not sleep or wanders for a thousand kalpas, and diligently practiced the most excellent methods of the four tantras, he would still only be in the dark. He is just building the evil karma of going to hell.

Slandering the guru is not good for the present and future lives. The "Fifty Verses of the Guru Devotion" says:

>
>If you are so foolish as to despise you Guru, 
>
>you will contract contagious diseases and those caused by harmful spirits. 
>
>You will die (a horrible death) caused by demons, plagues or poison.
>

>
>You will be killed by (wicked) kings or fire, 
>
>by poisonous snakes, water, witches or bandits, 
>
>by harmful spirits or savages, 
>
>and then be reborn in a hell.

This is the result of slandering the guru.

Since slandering the guru is the same as slandering the Buddhas and Tathagatas, those who slander the guru will not only suffer from illness and suffering in this world, be poisoned or be haunted by ghosts, but even lose their lives due to being overtaken and deceived by ghosts, poisonous snakes, robbers, etc., will also be harmed by evil spirits and go to hell, which is not good for this life nor the next.

To slander the guru is to slander the vajra guru, and to slander the master of the vajra is the sin of slandering the Buddhas and Tathagatas.
Ungenerated merits do not arise again; merits that have arisen also disappear.

The vajra guru mentioned here mainly refers to the teacher of tantric empowerment.

Just as the roots of a tree die, so will the branches and leaves of the tree.

The foundation of all merits and virtues is the power of faith in the guru. If you lose your faith in the guru and slander the guru, you will not only fail. When achievement occurs, even the original merit will be lost.

(2) Disobeying the Guru's Instructions 

The guru teaches his disciples how to study. If the disciples don't do it, they can't follow the teachings, which means that they have disobeyed the master's instructions.

What is the sin of disobeying the teacher's instructions?

Going against the teacher's instructions, there are many disasters in this life, and you will go to hell in the next life.

"Indestructible Tent Tantra" is a Tantra of the Supreme Yoga class of Tantra. The "Indestructible Tent Tantra" says:

Disciples who have received empowerment, 

if they violate the teacher's words, 

there will be many disasters in this life, 

and they will fall into hell in the next life.

After receiving tantric empowerment, if you disobey the teacher's instructions, you will suffer many disasters in this life, and you will go to hell in the next life.

The teacher's instructions mentioned here are the tantric precepts, not ordinary instructions. After the master has empowered the disciples, the disciples take and uphold the fourteen  fundamental tantric vows.

The master requires that the disciples not violate these precepts. If the precepts are violated, it is a violation of the master's instructions, and there will be sins of violating the master's instructions.

As Master usually says, disciples who disobey will also have karma, but there is no major karma.

So, when we are unable to do what our guru says, we must explain the reasons clearly to him.

99

For example, if the master asks the disciple to recite the one-hundred-syllable mantra one million times, the disciple has to think about whether it can be accomplished or not, and if not, he must explain the reason to the master, for example, he does not have that much time, etc., even if he admits that he is lazy, saying "I'm lazy" works too.

If the disciple simply ignores it, he is also guilty.

If you don't listen to your guru, you won't get any benefit from your practice. Master Tilopa said:

If you don't listen to your teacher,

you won't achieve success.

This sentence is very easy to understand. If you don’t listen to the teacher’s words and follow the teachings, you will naturally not achieve anything!

3. The sin of will

People who are just beginning to learn Buddhism, or those who have a very low level of diligence, have not yet firmed their confidence in the Three Jewels of the Guru, and they cannot control their thoughts, and their troubles will become heavier.

At this time, it is easy to give up or create negative karma.

However, if you also randomly guess and speculate about your teacher's words and deeds, and have all kinds of thoughts, or even get angry with the teacher and make him unhappy, the bad karma will increase.

100

(1) The sin of being angry with the guru 

The sin of being angry with the guru is stated in the Kalachakra Root Tantra:

The moment he was angry with the teacher, his good deeds were destroyed for a kalpa, and he was reborn in hell for several kalpas.

That is to say, if you are angry with your guru for a split second, the blessings of one kalpa will be eliminated, and you will go to hell after death, and you will have to stay in hell for several kalpas.

According to Hinayana, a snap of the fingers takes sixty-five "moments". Therefore, if one snaps a finger of anger toward a teacher or student, one will spend sixty-five kalpas in hell in the next life.

This is still the time calculated according to the Hinayana theory, and the time according to the Mahayana theory is even longer than this, we have to think about how terrible it is!

Anger towards teachers and students will also eliminate a lot of good fortune.

Except for the blessings of devotion, the blessings of bodhicitta, and the blessings of emptiness that will not disappear, other blessings will disappear.

So, don't get angry with the guru.

However, if you accidentally get angry with your guru, you should immediately repent to your guru, and your sins will be eliminated in an instant.

101

One month before Dharma Master Yongzeng passed away, and two months before Vajra Master Gazang Qusong passed away, he informed all his disciples as much as possible of the news that he was going to pass away.

The two masters were very merciful, and they did this so that the disciples could have time to eliminate their karma and repent in time, or to deal with other unsatisfactory things.

If the guru passes away, it will be more troublesome. Only by visualizing that the guru and Vajrasattva are indistinguishable, and reciting the hundred-syllable mantra one hundred thousand times at the same time, can the karma of being angry with the guru be eliminated.

(2) The sin of looking for the guru's faults and defects 

Always to be looking for and paying attention to the guru's shortcomings or defects, will reduce the strength of faith in the guru, and gradually lose confidence in the guru. In the end, a lot of merit will be lost. Once lost, it can not be recovered.

When the Buddha was alive, some people were taught by the Buddha himself to be tamed, but because they were always looking for the Buddha's shortcomings, they were not able to achieve it.

Shanxing Bhikkhu was one of the disciples of Buddha Shakyamuni. He doesn't look at the Buddha's merits, he only looks for the Buddha's faults, but he can't find any no matter how he looks.

He has been searching for twelve years, and finally found something: once, he saw Devadatta hitting Shakyamuni Buddha with a stone, and the Buddha's thumb was injured; another time, there was a thorn that hurt the sole of the Buddha's foot.


Shanxing Bhikkhu did not understand that these things are all due to causation, but he just thought that if the Buddha's ability is the greatest and his merit is the most perfect, the Buddha should not be harmed.

In this way, because Shanxing Bhikkhu often looked for the defects of the Buddha, he failed to achieve liberation in the end, and went to hell after death.

Later, the Buddha went to hell to save him. After seeing the Buddha, he developed faith and the Buddha saved him from hell.

Why do I see the flaws and defects of the guru? Everyone feels different about the guru when they look at their guru. Some people see the guru as very intimidating, some think the guru is not dignified, and some people think the guru is very dignified and kind.
This is determined by the degree of purification of one's own karma, as well as the viewpoint and prejudice of looking at the problem.

(1) Causes of Karma 

Sometimes, some people may think: "Since the guru is the incarnation of the Buddha, why is the guru still flawed? Since there are flaws, how can he be a perfect Buddha?"

In fact, what sentient beings see is unreal.

103

For example, although the Buddha is perfect, all living beings can only see Buddha Shakyamuni appearing in the form of a mortal person due to karma.

The flaws we see in our guru are also the cause of our own karma.

Everything in the eyes is the projection of karma, depending on what kind of karma there is, that kind of appearance will be seen.

Since the minds of sentient beings are polluted by karma, everything they see has a polluted appearance.

Just as the image of the moon in clear and turbid water is different, it is the water, not the moon, that makes the difference.

In order to see the Compassionate Venerable, Maitreya Bodhisattva, the Bodhisattva Asanga meditated on the Compassionate Venerable for twelve years.

When the karma was not pure, he could only see Maitreya Bodhisattva as a rotten mangy dog.

Twelve years later, when the karma was eliminated, he saw Maitreya Bodhisattva.

After seeing the Bodhisattva, he complained, saying that he had meditated for so long and worked so hard before he saw Maitreya Bodhisattva. Maitreya Bodhisattva said, "I've been by your side all the time, it's because of your karma that you couldn't see me."

Seeing that Bodhisattva Asanga did not believe him, Maitreya Bodhisattva said, "I'm sitting on your shoulder now. Go and ask other people what they see."

Then Maitreya Bodhisattva sat on the shoulders of Asanga Bodhisattva, and Asanga Bodhisattva asked people on the roadside to worship Maitreya Bodhisattva. As a result, everyone thought he was crazy and said that there was nothing on Asanga Bodhisattva's shoulders.

In the end, only one old grandmother said: "You have a mangy dog ​​with a rotten lower body on your shoulders, and there is no bodhisattva."

Only then did Asanga Bodhisattva believe the words of Maitreya Bodhisattva.

104

When Naropa was looking for his teacher Tilopa, a woman with leprosy, a mangy dog, etc. that he saw along the way were actually the manifestation of his teacher Tilopa, but he didn't recognize him. Afterwards he was desperate because Tilopa finally appeared when he could not see his master and was ready to commit suicide.

Naropa said:

"Master, I searched so hard, why did you not appear?"

Master Tilopa said, "I have always been by your side, and it is because of your bad karma that you do not recognize me."

The biographies of these patriarchs and great virtues are all real examples.

Therefore, it is the karma of sentient beings that obstructs them.

Although the guru possesses all the qualities of a Buddha, because the minds of sentient beings are blinded by ignorance, they cannot see that the guru is a Buddha. Instead, they will see that the guru has various flaws.

(2) Influence of perspective and prejudice 

On the other hand, when people look at problems, they are also affected by the perspective from which they look at the problem and the prejudice produced by their own experiences.

For example, when looking at one's own children, shortcomings will be regarded as advantages. Even if the child has shortcomings or faults, they will not care. This is a matter of perspective.

When a lively person sees a silent person, he will have a prejudice that the other party is difficult to communicate with. In fact, the other party may just like to be quiet; people who like to drink will generally ignore people who do not drink because of their own habits.

105

The same is true when disciples look at their masters, and they will unconsciously be affected by their own prejudices.

But because of the existence of ego, you think that you are always correct, and you will not realize that what you see is only superficial.

Therefore, one cannot judge that a guru has some kind of flaw or defect based on what he sees on the surface.

The flaws of the guru are actually merits. On the other hand, the flaws and defects shown by the guru are actually the embodiment of merits.
The Dharma body of a Buddha can only be seen by a Buddha and only a Buddha, not even a Bodhisattva of the highest rank can see this.

Even the dignified and solemn incarnation of the Buddha, that is, the body of the Buddha, can only be seen by ordinary people who are clean of karmic obstacles.

In Daojidi Ganluzang, it says:

Even before the hurdles of evil karma are removed, 

even though countless Buddhas come in person, 

apart from the appearances that you see now, 

there is no reason to get the good body of seeing appearances.

That is to say, for ordinary beings whose bad karma has not yet been purified, even if countless Buddhas come in person, they can only see the appearance presented by their own karma, and they cannot see the good and solemn appearance of the Buddha.

106

Not only that, even a teacher who seems to be an ordinary person cannot meet him if he does not have certain blessings, let alone hear his sermons.

Therefore, we must understand that the shortcomings and defects shown by the guru are for the benefit of sentient beings, not because they are really flawed, but only for the sake of clearing the karma of sentient beings.

Master Yeshi Jianshen said: 

The guru was originally a Buddha and Bodhisattva, and he was able to heal his flaws. In fact, it was because of the guru's merits and virtues that he could heal his flaws without the corresponding merits.

For example, in order to save sentient beings in a certain place, it is necessary to show signs of disability in order to attract everyone's attention.

Ordinary people may need to actually hurt their own bodies if they want to show their disability, such as breaking their arms, etc. But Buddhas and Bodhisattvas want to show their disability, and they can show it at any time without breaking their arms. This is the inherent merit of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas ability.

Zhangjia Living Buddha, the national teacher of Emperor Qianlong, was a highly accomplished master of the Gelug School. He practiced at a very high level and acquired many magical abilities.

However, such a virtuous master has very few disciples.

In his later years, Zhangjia Rinpoche had problems with his eyes. When he showed such defects, it corresponded to the blessings of all beings. Since then, countless disciples in Han, Tibet and Mongolia have followed to Zhangjia Rinpoche.

107

All of these show that when the disciple's blessings are not enough, the master must show some flawed appearances to create opportunities for the disciple. Otherwise, the disciple may not have the chance to listen to the master's sermons or even meet the master.

Blessings are really important. I have taught San Shi Dao all these years, such a precious and rare method, but very few people have the chance to hear it. Only those disciples who have practiced for a long time and accumulated blessings for a long time can have the opportunity to hear.

Those who are just starting out or those who have not enough good fortune will not hear about San Shi Dao.

Focusing on the sinful karma of finding the flaws of the guru, we now understand that the flaws manifested by the guru are for the benefit of all sentient beings.
Therefore, one cannot look for or focus on the flaws of the guru.

At the same time, the sin of paying attention to or seeking out the flaws of the guru is very serious.

The Sequel says:

Seeing the good results in success, seeing the fault destroys the achievement.

108

It means that if you pay attention to the merits of the guru and develop respect, you will also be successful in the future.

Conversely, focusing only on the guru's faults and defects hinders achievement and destroys the original merits.

Master Bodowa once said: 

"Focusing only on the faults and defects of the guru will not only lead to the failure of the guru's blessings, but will inspire generations to come when the evil consequences of failing to meet the guru will lead to vomiting, heartache, and numbness in this life. Madness and other illnesses, or disasters and misfortune.”

These are all things that we need to pay close attention to and must be kept in check at all times.

(3) Seeing the guru as an ordinary person 

People who are just beginning to learn Buddhism do not understand many aspects.

Faith and confidence have not yet been established, and they have no concept of many things. It is easy to regard the guru as an ordinary person like themselves. This is understandable, and it can be gradually changed through study and practice.

However, for those who have practiced for many years and even received tantric empowerment, no matter what the reason is, if they still treat their masters as ordinary people, this is actually a serious breach of precepts. Without blessings, there will be no progress and no achievement.

When Venerable Atisha first arrived in Tibet, Master Dhondunpa asked the Venerable: 

"There are many practitioners in Tibet, but why are so few attained?"

109

The Venerable replied: 

"No matter how big or small, the achievement of merit is inseparable from the master. You Tibetans treat the master as an ordinary person, how can you achieve success."

(4) The sin of despising the guru 

The Kadampa predecessors said:

Those who do not respect the guru are useless even if they are proficient in the Three Treasures.

There was a yogi in India, his guru was just a commoner, but he himself was a Brahmin nobleman, and he was highly accomplished, able to fly in the air.

Once, when he was flying in the air, he saw the master teaching the Dharma below. According to the etiquette, he should stop and pay respects to the master. However, he felt that his status and achievements had surpassed the master, so he was arrogant and deliberately flew through the air over the master's head. He fell to the ground on the spot and lost the ability to fly.

Disciples should never be arrogant and despise their masters because of their background, appearance, knowledge, etc.

Lay disciples should pay more attention not to look down on their masters because of their social status, position, wealth or other factors.

Otherwise, not only will you fail to achieve success in this life, but it will also hinder many future lives, and there will be endless troubles.

110

(5) Sins that make the guru unhappy 

If the disciple's words and deeds are inappropriate and bring unhappiness to the guru, this is also a sin.

A master with great compassion and virtue is generally not angry or unhappy about his disciple's inappropriate behavior.

And a teacher with insufficient moral ability may get angry and lose his temper when he sees his disciple's bad behavior.

If the master is really angry, the disciple will have committed a great sin, and the retribution will be heavy.

In the Fifty Verses of Guru Devotion, it says:

Never disturb you Guru's mind. Should you be foolish and happen to do this, you will surely boil in hell.

That is to say, as a disciple, at no time should you cause the guru to be upset or unhappy.

Otherwise, you will suffer in hell!

However, a master with virtue will not get angry easily, and has a strong ability to endure humiliation. When a disciple's behavior is inappropriate, such a master will not care, and will seize this opportunity to practice forbearance.

Even if some disciples criticise their masters, the masters will not get angry. Therefore, after taking refuge in a master with virtue, the disciples will generally not run into this problem.

(6) The sin of misunderstanding the teacher’s words and deeds 

111

A guru is a Buddha, so every word and deed of a guru is for the benefit of all sentient beings. If you don’t understand the practice and behavior of your guru for the time being, don’t have bad misunderstandings.

Misunderstanding the teacher's meaning can also lead to sin.

If you are beaten by your guru, you should think that the guru is exorcising evil spirits for you; if you are scolded by your guru, you should think that your guru is reciting the mantra of a wrathful deity and blessing us; Think like this, "It must be that the guru is looking out for us."

If the guru acts like he hates us, think that it is the guru who is removing karma and obstacles for us.

The Mahasiddha Tsangpa Gyarepa said:

Whipping is empowerment, from which blessings are obtained, scolding is a fierce curse, removes all demonic obstacles, hates and alienates, loves soothe me, loves me for growth, hates me for encouragement, everything is convenient.

Treat being beaten by a guru as an empowerment, and you will definitely receive blessings.

Being scolded by the master is regarded as a fierce curse, which will definitely exorcise the demons.

It is okay to think that everything the guru does is for our own good.

Some actions of the master, such as beating and scolding the disciple, usually have deeper meaning.

Moreover, a master with virtue will not easily get angry, beat and scold his disciples.

112

The abbot of Labrang Monastery, Master Jiangyang Xieba, is a great siddhi, a very special kind of teacher, who is very compassionate towards every disciple.

There is one disciple, however. As soon as this disciple shows up, he will scold the disciple and even beat him with things. This happens every time he sees him, so that everyone agreed that Master treated this disciple too badly. This behavior continued for several years.

A few years later, Jiangyang Xieba said to this disciple: "I used to beat you and scold you to help you eliminate karma. Now, when a great disaster comes, someone needs to preserve the lineage of the Dharma. I beat and scold you every day. If you can bear it, it shows that you are capable of taking on heavy responsibilities, so I did not choose anyone else, only you, and you will keep the scriptures."

Two hundred years ago, Qinghai was in chaos, many monasteries were destroyed, and almost all Buddhist texts were burned.

Muslims arrested monks when they see monks, but when those Muslims saw this disciple of Jiangyang Xieba, they felt very close and treated him very well, so many scriptures were preserved.

In the past, there was a master at Ta'er Monastery, and a disciple had been ill for several years. This disciple often came to ask Master for blessings.

Once, when this disciple came to ask his Master for blessings again, Master beat him with a stick and scolded him while beating: "Every day you ask for blessing, it is useless to bless you every day."

113

The master was very angry and hit him.

Right away, the disciple's illness was cured, and the master had removed many demonic obstacles for him in this way.

Once, I saw Master Gazang Qusong beat his attendant. The waiter was a Mongolian. Master Gazang Qusong scolded him and beat him angrily. He cried and left. Then the master returned to the room and secretly smiled.

Therefore, Master Gazang Qusong was not really angry, but pretended to be angry, in order to exorcise this disciple and eliminate his ego.

A master with virtue will not mess around, and everything he does has a certain meaning or a great secret meaning, so we can't distort it or misunderstand it at will.

Before Venerable Milarepa entered Buddhism, in order to take revenge, he went to a Bonbo master in Tibet to learn the methods of cursing and black magic.

Cursing the relatives who took his property and persecuted his mother and sister after his father died.

Because of this, many people were killed, and the sin was very heavy.

Later, Venerable Milarepa met Guru Marpa, and when he visited Guru Marpa, he told Guru Marpa that he was very poor and had nothing to offer him, so he offered his body, speech and mind.

Master Marpa said, "Very well, from today onwards, your body belongs to me, and you should do what I tell you to do."

114

For the next nine years, Master Marpa beat and scolded Milarepa every day, ordered him to work every day, and even asked him to do work that was unnecessary. Even Master Marpa's wife couldn't stand it anymore. Seeing Milareba suffer every day, she was about to cry.

When Marpa was lecturing on the sutras, Milarepa came to listen to the teachings. As soon as Milarepa came, Master Marpa reprimanded him: "What are you doing here? What qualifications do you have to listen to the sutras? You are a traitor!" He scolded Milarepa in front of many people.

The same is true when receiving empowerment. Because the method of receiving empowerment is very precious, sometimes, some people use the wealth they have accumulated for a lifetime to ask for empowerment.

At this time, Master Marpa scolded Milarepa: "You are just a poor ghost, what can you use to participate in the empowerment?"

In the end, no one could stand it anymore, and even Milarepa had doubts about himself, thinking how good it would be if his life was over.

Nine years later, one day, Master Marpa held a grand and solemn empowerment ceremony, and many great disciples came. Master Marpa was in front of the disciples, offering a throne with his own hands, and then said, I'm going to invite Milarepa to sit here today.

Milarepa was very frightened on hearing this, thinking that Master Marpa was playing tricks on him again. When he sat on the throne tremblingly, Master Marpa said solemnly: "Before, I was here to help you Eliminate karma, starting from today, you are my real noble disciple, and I will not scold you again."

Master Marpa often beat and scolded Milarepa in order to eliminate Milarepa's sins.

He said regretfully that if Milarepa could endure ten years of asceticism, he could achieve enlightenment in one lifetime without practicing.

But everyone interceded for him, so he only practiced asceticism for nine years. Since his sins were not yet expiated in full, he would have to go through a long period of ascetic practice before he could achieve liberation.

Master Yanggongba said:

What you show is all merit, what you say is all teaching, and what you do is all righteous and beneficial.

What the guru does is merit, and what the guru says is teaching.

For the disciple, all the actions of the guru are beneficial, so there will be no misunderstanding when looking at the actions of the guru.

This is very important!

(7) Treating the Guru's Sins Unequally

After attending a teacher, the disciple must treat the master as a master with virtue, otherwise, there will be great sins.

Some people have followed many gurus successively as their masters, and they have consulted these masters for teachings and received empowerments.

116

But in the end, they just want to get close to those famous and prestigious teachers, or the teachers they like.

In fact, this is the selfish mind of discrimination and greed. There may be differences in some aspects of the masters themselves. However, from the perspective of disciples, they should all be regarded as Buddhas and Bodhisattvas who came to educate them, and should be treated the same. The same respect, the same blessing.

If there is discrimination, you should realize your mistake quickly.

The scriptures say:

Teach one or four verses, if you don't look at it as a teacher, you will be born in a dog's body for a hundred rebirths, and then you will have a humble body.

If you don't do this, not only will your wishes in this life be unsatisfied, but you will also become a dog in the next life. After you have been reborn as a dog a hundred times at least, you may become a more difficult person.

Therefore, if you follow a guru, the disciple must treat the master equally, and treat the master who he has followed as a guru with all the virtues.

117

##### 4. The attitude of approaching to the guru 

The attitude of being close to the guru is to see the guru as a Buddha.

In order to see the teacher as a Buddha, you should always think about the teacher's own merits and the teacher's kindness towards you, build confidence and generate respect.

1. The merits and virtues of reciting the guru and building confidence. 

Although the blessing of the guru can increase the merits of the five realms and ten places, it still depends on whether the disciple's trust in the guru is deep and firm enough.

If the disciples believe in the guru the way they believe the Buddha, it can greatly increase the depth and breadth of their belief in the guru, and it can also help avoid other wrong views.

Therefore, it is very important for the disciple to be able to see the teacher as a Buddha and thus to develop trust in the teacher.

Although the guru is a Buddha, when the disciples first began to learn Buddhism, they don't have enough merit, and they can't not see it.

Therefore, it is necessary to understand the infinite transforming power of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas, as well as the uninterrupted vast power of vows to transform sentient beings.

118

(1) The incarnation of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas 

The incarnations of inconceivable Buddhas and Bodhisattvas pervade all times, and all places.

This is because the Dharma bodies of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas are inconceivable, so the wisdom of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas is everywhere, and the wisdom of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas can be transformed into Dharma bodies at will.

The womb-entering and birth of ordinary people must follow the laws of nature, and the transformation of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas is beyond the laws of the world.

Now, because of heavy karma and insufficient blessings, we cannot see the incarnations of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas for the time being.

When you reach the golden bodhicitta, you can see the Buddha's extraordinary incarnation, which is the Buddha's physical body, and you can also hear the sutras preached by the extraordinary incarnation.

After cultivating to see the Bodhisattva of the first bhumi, you will begin to see the Buddha's Sambhogakaya and hear the Mahayana of the Sambhogakaya.

When Buddhas and Bodhisattvas save sentient beings, they generally have three kinds of manifestations: responsive to conditions, responsive tools, and responsive benefits. In this way, they can attract sentient beings with different external circumstances, internal faculties, and different interests and needs.

The inconceivable salvation of karma is the manifestation of the karma that Buddhas and Bodhisattvas should save sentient beings.
That is, when saving sentient beings, Buddhas and Bodhisattvas want to appear with the same race, the same kind, and the same causal conditions as the sentient beings to be saved.

119

Only in this way can all beings psychologically identify with and be willing to accept the subduing and transformation of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas.

The founder of Kadampa, Master Zhongdunba, was an incarnation of Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva, but he looked like a very ordinary person.

Venerable Atisha taught scriptures in Tibet for seventeen years. When he was in Ali, he said, "I want to go back to India. The weather in Tibet is too cold. There are many disciples in India waiting for me to teach the Dharma."

Master Zhongdunba said: "There are many more sentient beings in Tibet that you need to save than in India. You can go to Lhasa. There is a place called Nie Tang nearby. It is very warm and you can see flowers in winter."

After hearing this, Venerable Atisha said: "If this is the case, I will go to Lhasa and live in the place you said with flowers blooming in winter."

When winter came, Venerable Atisha went to Lhasa.

After arriving in Lhasa, the Venerable Atisha asked Master Zhongdunpa: "Where is this place you told me about with flowers blooming in winter? Let's go there."

When they arrived at Nie Tang, they found a very small flower by a small stream. Master Zhongdunpa pointed to the flower and said, "This kind of flower blooms in winter."

Venerable Atisha said: "Alas! It can be said that you are not lying. However, what I want to see is not such a small flower, but a very large flower."

Master Zhongdunpa thought for a while, and then said: "Master, you can see as many flowers as you want to see, you can see them."

Master Zhongdunpa stuck out his tongue, which looked as big as the whole of Tibet, with various thousand-petal lotus blossoms open on it.

120

A master like Zhongdunpa looked like a very ordinary old man. When he was old, he often had a runny nose, but he was really the incarnation of Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva.

When Buddhas and Bodhisattvas save sentient beings, they will sometimes transform into animals.

In the past, in order to save birds, Buddha Shakyamuni transformed into a bird.

In the Biography of Zhenwen Dawa, it is recorded that the Buddha turned into a bird in order to save birds, a monkey in order to save a monkey, and a king of hungry ghosts in order to save living beings from the hungry ghosts.

When Buddhas and Bodhisattvas transform into different kinds of sentient being, they must transform into the same species with the same  appearance as sentient beings.

"Baoji Jing·Father and Son Meeting" says:

---

Sometimes Brahma and Buddha appear, sometimes demons appear,

Benefit all sentient beings, the world is unfathomable,

Women and women stop, also in the way of animals,

No greed, no fear, no fear,

No madness, no madness, no madness,

The appearance of the non-blind and the blind, various manifestations,

Subduing all beings.

---

Father and son here means master and apprentice.

In Tibetan Buddhism, father and son are often used to refer to Mahasiddha and his disciples, or teachers and apprentices who have a good relationship, such as Atisha and his son, which refer to Atisha and Zhongdunpa - master and disciple.

121

This sutra says that Buddhas and Bodhisattvas often show signs that sentient beings can accept in order to save them.

The sentence-by-sentence translation is: In order to save sentient beings, Buddhas and Bodhisattvas sometimes appear in the form of Brahma Kings and Dishatians; when saving demons, they will appear as Demon Kings; when Buddhas and Bodhisattvas benefit sentient beings in the world, it is difficult for us ordinary people to measure their words and deeds.

When they appear female, they behave the same as women; sometimes they also appear in the animal realm; Buddhas and Bodhisattvas have already cut off greed, hatred, and delusion, but in order to allow all beings to accept them, they will show greed without greed; If there is no ignorance, there will be the appearance of ignorance; if there is no madness, there will be the appearance of madness; if the eye of the Dharma is like a torch, there will be the appearance of blindness, and so on.

The purpose of showing various faults is to correspond to the faculties of sentient beings, so as to help sentient beings believe and accept them and pacify them.

Ordinary people can only accept a mortal appearance, that is to say, the illusion of mortal appearance.

Therefore, Buddhas and Bodhisattvas transform into ordinary people, and gurus are Buddhas and Bodhisattvas who transform into ordinary people to benefit sentient beings.

The degree of responsiveness is incredible. Among the sentient beings of the same species and the same kind, due to different conditions such as ability, wisdom, and blessings, different psychological cognitions will be generated, and finally different root tools will be used.

122

Responsive transformation means that Buddhas and Bodhisattvas transform all sentient beings into corresponding appearances according to the different root tools of sentient beings.

All living beings have different faculties and different understandings. They accept different teachings and choose different religions and sects.

Buddhas and Bodhisattvas manifest according to the foundation of sentient beings, and whatever kind of foundation the sentient beings have, Buddhas and Bodhisattvas turn into that kind of teacher.

Buddhas and Bodhisattvas have transformed themselves into gods of other religions in order to save sentient beings from those other religions.

Among the precepts of tantra, there is a precept that one should not slander the gods and patriarchs of other religions.

There are many kinds of religion, and it can be said that most of the leaders and gods of those other religions are incarnations of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas.

For example, in Hinduism, there are two Mahayana kings, one is the real one, and the other is the embodiment of Buddha and Bodhisattva; the same is true of Brahma. 

The Virgin Mary of the Catholic Church was an incarnation of Guanyin Bodhisattva.

These are the incarnations of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas, especially Avalokitesvara.

Because the sentient beings who accept this type of religion only have the blessing of doing some good deeds, or the fruit of human beings and heaven, but not the blessing of liberation.

Therefore, they can only accept the teachings of the corresponding type of religion, and Buddhas and Bodhisattvas will take the form of the leaders of that type of religion to save them.

Now, there are very few people with the blessing of liberation, and there are many people with ordinary blessings. Buddhas and Bodhisattvas will take the form of incarnations that these people can accept to guide them.

123

We have chosen the most excellent and ultimate Buddhism, and we have converted to the Mahayana in Buddhism, and it is also the most excellent Vajrayana in the Mahayana, and we have learned to study Tsongkhapa, the most complete and most difficult to meet in the Vajrayana. The teachings of the master.

What is even more rare is that I also met a master who has mastered this teaching method. While feeling joy and happiness, I must clearly understand that the master is the Buddha and Bodhisattva who respond to our kind of people and come to save us.

The inconceivable benefit of conversion refers to the transformation of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas in response to the interests and needs of all beings, manifesting the corresponding signs to save all beings.

For example, the often-mentioned "Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva, who is loving and compassionate, and who saves from suffering and calamities," will appear immediately when sentient beings encounter disasters, and the allusions of Green Tara, etc., are all good examples.

Now, when we want to learn the Dharma and have the aim of ​gaining ​liberation from samsara, we meet the corresponding guru.

Therefore, we must understand that a guru is a Buddha or Bodhisattva who comes to meet our needs and to teach us the Dharma.

After understanding this, it is even more necessary to establish faith in the guru and truly treat the guru as a Buddha or Bodhisattva.

124

(2) The vows of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas are inconceivable. 

Before each Buddha attains Buddhahood, he will generate Bodhicitta, and he will make a vow. After attaining Buddhahood, he will work to save sentient beings.

Therefore, after becoming a Buddha, the power of vows will also mature, and the Buddha will definitely return to take advantage of the vows to save sentient beings.

However, due to the heavy karma of sentient beings in the age of the degeneration of the Dharma, people will not be able to see the manifestation of the Buddha, and the Buddha will take the form of a teacher.

In the "Indestructible Tent Tantra", Vajra Master Zongzhi said:

Originally a diamond heart, 

it appears as a teacher, 

for the benefit of all sentient beings, 

and turns into an ordinary person.

That is to say, in the future, in the evil world of five turbidities, in order to save all sentient beings, the Vajra Master will incarnate as a teacher, and the above-mentioned teachers will save all sentient beings.

There are many such classics, and the "Second Thoughts Continuation" also says:

In the five hundred years of the end of the Dharma era, 

I will manifest the teacher's body,

Recognize it as my body and my heart,

and have a heart of admiration for him.

Buddha Shakyamuni once said the same thing. The sutras said: 

When the Buddha was about to pass away, he saw Yi Bodhisattva and asked Shakyamuni Buddha, after the Buddha passed away, who would guide the monks and how the sentient beings in the Saha world should be saved? Buddha Shakyamuni replied:

125

Jianyi, listen to me, 

in that future life, 

I will appear as a teacher, 

and I will transform into a teacher.

This is what Shakyamuni Buddha himself promised.

Therefore, we can conclude that the guru is the Buddha.

Praying and visualizing the guru with this belief is the foundation for eliminating karmic obstacles, accumulating blessings, and becoming a Buddha after liberation.

Vajrapani Bodhisattva and the four deities, in order to save sentient beings, often take the form of ready-made masters. These masters seem to be ordinary people, simple ordinary people.

Therefore, some people have many teachers, and one of them must be the incarnation of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas; some people have only one teacher, so this teacher must be the incarnation of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas.

When our karma is very heavy, when we look at the guru, we will feel that he is very ordinary, and even see that the guru has many shortcomings and faults; when half of the karma has been eliminated, we can see the guru's many merits; when most of the karma has been eliminated, we have truly entered the path. When you attain bodhicitta, you see your guru as a bodhisattva; when you reach the level of a bodhisattva of the eighth ground, you see your guru as the incarnation of a Buddha or deity; when you reach a tenth-level bodhisattva, you see your guru as the Buddha’s Sambhogakaya.

Therefore, we should now consider our root guru, as well as all lineage masters, to be all Buddhas and Bodhisattvas.

(3) The virtues of reciting the lineage teachers build confidence 

126

Now that we have understood that the guru is the incarnation of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas, let’s think about the merits and virtues of the guru from all aspects: The guru is proficient in the five great treatises, the four classes of tantras, and the ten great dharmas. Being a monk, etc., these are the merits of the guru, all for the purpose of educating and benefiting sentient beings.

This makes it easy to build up confidence in the guru.

The greater the confidence in the guru, the better, and the greater the confidence, the greater the blessings you will receive.

Confidence in the guru is cultivated to the highest level. Seeing the guru and the Buddha as indistinguishable, seeing the guru and seeing the Buddha, seeing the Buddha and seeing the guru.

At this time, great energy will naturally be accumulated and many karmic obstacles will be eliminated.

2. Reciting the kindness of the master inspires respect 

For ordinary disciples, the belief that the guru is a Buddha is not strong enough, and many people do not have a deep understanding of the kindness of the guru.

Therefore, you should always think about the kindness of your guru, which will help you to increase your faith and respect for your guru.

(1) The Master's Compassion surpasses Buddha's

127

Teacher's kindness always surpasses all Buddhas. A teacher is a Buddha, a teacher is the same as a Buddha, but in terms of kindness, the kindness of a teacher is greater than that of all the Buddhas.
In the past innumerable kalpas, countless Buddhas were born, but none of us deserved to meet them.

According to the classic records, in the Saha kalpa we are now in, there will be a thousand Buddhas born. Buddha Shakyamuni is the fourth Buddha. Buddha Shakyamuni and Buddha Kasyapa were born to guide and educate sentient beings, but none of us encountered them.

Now, we have met the guru, and the guru also taught us the full circle teaching of liberation and enlightenment, and guided us.

Therefore, although the merits of the master are equal to those of the Buddhas, the kindness of our teacher is greater than that of all the Buddhas.

Master Potoba once said, to the effect that: 

For ordinary practitioners, the appearance of the Buddha is the icing on the cake, but the appearance of the guru is a blessing in disguise, and the kindness of the guru is even greater.

Because in the early stage of learning, you will generally not see the Buddha, let alone accept the teachings of the Buddha.

Only after one has cultivated to a certain level and reached a certain level, can one see the Buddha, and even hear the Buddha speak sutras.

However, once the cultivators have reached a very high level, and even if they cannot see the Buddha, the achievement may be a matter of one day to the next.

But the guru is different. The guru usually pulls the disciples back from the brink of the three evil realms when the disciples are just learning Buddhism, or even before they learn Buddhism, saves their Dharmakaya's wisdom and life, and leads them to liberation.

Therefore, for ordinary practitioners, the kindness of the guru is immense.

128

Master Kedrup Je said in "Ode to the Three Auspicious Realms":

All sentient beings in the three realms have only one eye, 

the supreme master of all seeking liberation,

Great compassion surpasses all buddhas, 

and the unparalleled master invites you.

When we can't meet or see other Buddhas and Bodhisattvas, only the guru can teach us the Dharma, teach us the practices, and guide us. Therefore, the guru's kindness to us surpasses that of the Buddha.

The master's compassion is even better than Sakyamuni Buddha's 

Buddhist scriptures say that during the calamity period of the sage kalpa, in the Saha world, there was a wheel-turning holy king who ruled the four continents. The minister is called Hai Chen.

When they aroused bodhicitta before the Treasure Treasure Tathagata, the Treasure Treasure Tathagata prophesied that they would become Buddhas in virtuous kalpas, and after they became Buddhas, they would receive their respective realms.

At this time, everyone chooses the period that is easy to control or the pure land. In the end, there are two periods of life spanning 100 years and 80,000 years old. No one dares to choose these two periods, because they have observed that the life span is 100 years old. When I was in a period of conflict, it was difficult to subdue all the sentient beings, so they were afraid and gave up.

129

Finally, Minister Hai Chen decided to subdue all sentient beings during the century of human life after becoming a Buddha.

The wheel-turning holy king Fu Wang was the later Amitabha Buddha, his thousand sons were the later Xian Kalpa Thousand Buddhas, and the minister Hai Chen was Shakyamuni Buddha.

Therefore, to us living beings in the age of one hundred year life-span, Shakyamuni is more gracious than other Buddhas.

However, even so, we still do not have the good fortune to meet the Buddha, and we can only rely on the teacher to purify us, so the teacher's kindness is even more important.

It is also stated in "A Guide to the Bodhisattva's Way of Life":

To benefit all sentient beings, 

countless Buddhas have passed away,

but because of my own faults, 

I have not been taught by them.

After the Buddha passed away, many masters and great siddhas appeared in India and Tibet.

In the post-Hong Kong period of Tibetan Buddhism, there have been many incomparable and extraordinary figures such as the Five Sakya Patriarchs, Master Marpa, Venerable Milarepa, Venerable Atisha, Dhondunpa, and Master Tsongkhapa. Dade.

However, due to our own karma, we were not able to receive the guidance of these masters due to the location and time of our rebirth.

Only the present masters never leave us and teach us to renounce suffering and attain happiness.

Therefore, for us, the teacher's kindness is especially important.

130

(2) The grace of the teaching Guru's kindness is far more than the above.

Venerable Atisha, in order to hear the teaching of the order of the Path, disregarded the danger of storms and other dangers, and drifted in the sea for thirteen months before he found Master Serlingpa; Master Marpa, Venerable Milarepa and other patriarchs, He went through hardships to seek the Dharma.

The road to India used to be very difficult, but the translators still went to India desperately to seek the Dharma.

According to the biography, later, when they recalled the hardships and dangers of the road, they often trembled with fear.

Now, we do not need to suffer even a little bit to seek the Dharma, and the master has taught us the complete Dharma.

In "The Essential Nectar of the Holy Doctrine" it says:

Even after the same verse for several kalpas, it will be difficult to make offerings to repay the teacher's kindness.

It is also said in the Diamond Sutra that the merit of explaining one or four verses of the Dharma to others is greater than the merit of filling the three thousand great thousand worlds with seven treasures. The Perfection teaching was passed on to us.

It also teaches us to repent of bad karma, increase the blessings, and gain happiness.

For such a great kindness, we should always think about it and feel grateful. Who else has greater kindness than a teacher!

131

(3) The grace of continuous blessing 

All the progress of our practice comes from the blessing of the guru.

When we practice guru yoga, we want to achieve rapid achievement through the blessing of the guru.

Now, we have the opportunity to receive the empowerment, and the one who gave the empowerment and planted the seeds of liberation for us is the vajra guru.

If you don't get the tantra empowerment, you won't even be able to read books on tantra. It's the guru who lets us see the dawn of liberation in the samsara of our lives.

(4) The kindness of reciting the master inspires devotion to Venerable Atisha and said, "All my merits belong to the master."

The meaning of this sentence is: all merits are born only by the grace of the guru.

The human body, happiness, good health, wealth, etc. that we have gained in this life, although it seems that all these are the blessings of our previous life to uphold the ten good precepts and practice generosity, in fact, getting such blessings is also the grace of the teacher's teaching.

Therefore, all our happiness comes from the guru.

132

In all aspects, big and small, we should often think about the kindness of the guru: we didn’t know how to learn Buddhism and do good deeds before, but the guru taught us to enter the Buddhist gate.

We didn't know taking refuge before, but the guru led us to take refuge in the Three Jewels and saved us from falling into the evil realms. This is the kindness of the guru.

We didn't know what was bad karma and what was good karma before; which is good fortune and which is karma, but now we can distinguish it clearly. This is the kindness of the guru.

We didn't understand Buddhism before, but now we are making progress every day and opened up wisdom. This is the kindness of the guru.

We couldn't recite "Om Mani Pami Hum" before, but the master taught us to recite it. This is the kindness of the master.

In the past, we were not able to obtain a precious human life, and we often lost our temper. After listening to the teacher's teaching, we don't lose our temper any more. This is the kindness of the teacher.

We used to be very greedy, but now we're less greedy. This is the kindness of the guru.

We didn't even know how to bow before, but the guru taught us. This is the kindness of the guru.

Guru's kindness and parents' kindness are the greatest kindness.

The kindness of parents is the kindness of nurturing, and the kindness of the guru is the kindness of teaching Dharma, the kindness of opening up wisdom, the kindness of nourishing blessings, and the kindness of breaking samsara.

Think about all these aspects, how much progress you have made than before, all from the kindness of your guru.

#### Section 5 How to learn to be close to the guru 

We now understand why we are talking about being close to the guru. We also understand the merits of being close to the guru, as well as the various disadvantages of being disrespectful to the guru. Next, we need to learn how to meditate. Get close to the guru.

1. How to practice during the right practice. 

The part of the right practice is divided into the preliminary stage, the main stage, and the dedication.

Preliminary practice, also known as additional practice, is the preparatory work before the main practice begins, and it is the reason why the experience of right practice can arise smoothly in the mind.

(1) Preliminaries are divided into five steps.

Sweeping the practice area and setting up Buddha statues (1) Sweeping and cleaning the practice area is the practice of Venerable Atisha’s guru, Master Serlingpa. The purpose is to invite our master to the practice area through visualization later, to express respect for Buddha and Bodhisattvas, there is great merit.
135

According to the "Pavilion Sutra", there are five kinds of merits in cleaning the practice area:

1) Clean your mind. Get rid of the defilements in your heart, and you will be happy.

2) Purify the heart. Remove the defilements in the hearts of all sentient beings who come to this practice area, and make them happy.

3) The Dharma protectors are often protected. Heavenly dragon protectors like to be clean, and they like to protect them even more.

4) Delightful. The body of the sweeper will be healthy and beautiful, and the discipline will be pure.

5) Born in the land of Buddha.

After death, you will be reborn in the Pure Land.

When cleaning the practice area, if the intention is to become a Buddha and save sentient beings, in order to make the guru Three Jewels happy, there will be greater merit, and the intention is very important.

Among the disciples of the Buddha, Zhou Lipan Tuojia attained the fruit of Arahantship from the Yisasao Taoist Temple.

When Venerable Ananda first became a monk, he yearned for a small family and could not practice peacefully. The Buddha also asked him to clean the jungle and gradually get rid of the obstacles of greed.

136

(2) Before the Buddha statues were displayed, the teachers of the Kadam School often carried the Buddha statue of Sakyamuni Buddha with them. belief.

Now, temples and Buddhist halls generally have installed Buddha statues, so there is no need to carry them around them.

For Buddha statues, many people may always think: "I am very familiar with those Buddha statues, and there is nothing to see."

In fact, every time you look at a Buddha statue, if you look at the Buddha statue as the real body of a Buddha and Bodhisattva with respect, you will continue to produce extraordinary merit and other fruits in your heart, and you will gradually see the image as real Buddhas and Bodhisattvas.

In addition, the clay statues and bronze statues that we see now, when we cultivate to the Dharma Flow Samadhi of the Mahayana Accumulation Path, we will see that these are like the truly extraordinary incarnations of the Buddha.

At this time, we can still remember the sutras and teachings passed down to us by our previous masters that we have forgotten, and we will not forget them again; when we attain the position of Bodhisattva of the first bhumi, we will see that the Buddha statue is the true Buddha’s perfect Sambhogakaya.

Therefore, it is extremely important to think of Buddha statues as the true bodies of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas.

Display offerings without flattery 

137
After setting up the Buddha statue, it is time to make offerings. At this time, you should pay attention and make offerings to the Buddhas and Tathagatas without flattery.

Flattery is flattery, a flattering and fawning mentality is used for the purpose of deception.

Flattery is divided into two aspects: flattery of offerings and flattery of motivation.

Flattery of offerings: For lay people, it refers to offerings obtained by stealing, killing, cheating, or other means, or offerings purchased with improper means to make money. Such offerings cannot be used to make offerings to Buddhas and Bodhisattvas.

Motivational flattery is intentional flattery, and intentional mischief is intentional.

The intention is not to make offerings to save sentient beings, liberate and become Buddhas, but to gain fame and name.

In addition, when lay people make offerings, they are generally for the benefit of this life, happiness, etc., and their intentions are relatively small, and the merits and blessings obtained will be small. These are all things that should be paid attention to.

After sitting upright, taking refuge and making offerings to the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas, it is time to sit down to practice and make offerings.
(1) Sit upright on a comfortable cushion, with the back high and the front low, sitting in the eight-support method of Pilu.

138

If you can't do the Vairocana Eight-Support Method, you can sit in a sitting posture that you feel comfortable with, and prepare to practice the four refuges, the bodhicitta, and the four immeasurable wishes.

(2) Refuge Before starting to practice

taking refuge, you must first visualize the merit field.

1) Visualize the field of seed and seed. The field of seed is also called the field of blessing, and there are five or six different fields of blessing.

Ordinary people, if we don’t have such a strong ability to visualize, just visualize the guru and Buddha Shakyamuni as indistinguishable, or visualize the guru and the Buddhas as indistinguishable.

Then, practice taking refuge and making the sevn branch offerings.

If you are wiser and more capable, you can visualize the Buddha field in "The Tao of Peace and Happiness": in the space in front of you, tens of meters away and directly between your eyebrows, visualize a lotus throne held high by eight white lions. The superior visualization and his own root guru are indistinguishable from Shakyamuni Buddha. Facing himself, he holds the bowl in his left hand to form a seal, and his right hand forms a seal on the ground; the Buddha's mind visualizes the Vajra Master, and the Vajra Master holds the mind. Think of a blue Sanskrit hum () character.

This kind of Shakyamuni Buddha visualisation is called Nengren Vajra General Holder.

139

Before Shakyamuni Buddha, facing yourself, visualize your root guru; around the root guru, visualize the guru with whom you have a dharma connection; around the masters, visualize the deity, and others Buddhas, Bodhisattvas, warriors, brave mothers, Dharma protectors and other wisdom deities.

In front of the Dharma thrones of all the deities, there are teachings of their own, which appear in the form of scriptures that emit light. Visualize the Buddhas, Bodhisattvas and teachers looking at them with joy.

If the visualization ability is stronger, you can visualize the buddha field in detail in the following way:

Above the head of Nengren Vajradhara, visualize the lineage gurus of the practice and blessings group headed by Vajradhara, such as the great yogis such as Venerable Rahula and Venerable Levwa.

The right shoulder of Nengren Vajradhara is shining, and on the light, he visualizes Maitreya Bodhisattva, the surroundings of Maitreya Bodhisattva, and visualizes the lineage masters of the Guangxing School, such as Bodhisattva Asanga, Bodhisattva of Worldly Relatives, Bodhisattva of Liberation Army, etc.

On the left shoulder of Nengren Vajra Holder, there is light on the light to visualize Manjusri Bodhisattva, around Manjusri Bodhisattva, and visualize the lineage masters of the Deep View School, such as Nagarjuna, Moon Bodhisattva, Dazheng Li Rhododendron, and Venerable Atisha. Wait.

Our gurus include root gurus, as well as lineage gurus from the Guangxing School, the Deep View School, and the Practice and Blessing School.

In front of Nengren Vajra Master, there is the surrounding of the Dharma-connected guru, and visualize the four deities.

140

The first is the deity of Supreme Yoga, such as the Five Vajras: Victory Vajra, Kashgar, Hevajra, Kalachakra, and Mahavira.

The outer periphery of the Deity of Supreme Yoga, visualize the Deity of Yoga.

For example, the Great Sun Tathagata, etc., there are many deities in the yoga department.

On the periphery of the deity of the yoga department, visualize the deity of the practice department, including Vairocana Bodhi Buddha and so on.

On the periphery of the Xingbu Deity, visualize the Shibu Deity, such as the Twenty-One Tara's, Manjushri, Guanyin Bodhisattva, the Eight Great Bodhisattvas, and the Five-Nature Gods of Wealth are all the Shibu Deity.

On the periphery of the deity of Shibu, visualize all the Buddhas and Tathagatas, mainly thousands of Buddhas and thirty-five confession Buddhas; on the periphery of the Buddhas and Tathagatas, visualize all the bodhisattvas; on the periphery of the bodhisattvas, visualize the Arhats, including the Arhats and Shravakas. Arhats, Yuanjue Arhats have a little protruding top bun on their heads, but Shravakas do not; around Arhats, visualize the Dharma protectors, including the four-faced Mahakala, the six-armed Mahakala, the four-armed Mahakala, two-armed Mahakala, Auspicious Heavenly Mother, Heavenly King of Wealth, etc.; Outside the Dharma Protectors, the four heavenly kings are visualized in the four directions under the lotus throne.

After visualizing the field of good fortune, visualize the minds of Nengren Vajrapani and all the Buddhas and Tathagatas, emitting immeasurable white light, welcoming all the gurus, the four deities, all the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas, etc., and the gurus, Buddhas, Bodhisattvas, etc. In the body of the deity's Dharma protectors, the two are indistinguishable.

141

This is the case with the fields of blessing in "The Way of Peace and Happiness". When we cultivate the order of the path, it is the most extraordinary to be able to visualize in this way.

If it is difficult to visualize in this way, you can sit on the lotus throne and visualize Tsongkhapa who is indistinguishable from your own root guru. Tsongkhapa is surrounded by four deities, and then visualize the innumerable Buddhas and Bodhisattvas merging into the sect. Master Tsongkhapa.

If it is difficult to visualize in this way, visualize on the lotus throne that your root guru and the Buddhas and Tathagatas are indistinguishable.

Visualizing the merit field should be at a moderate height. Too high or too low will cause the risk of falling off and drowsiness. Therefore, the most suitable position is right between our eyebrows.

The distance from us, according to the "On the Path to Enlightenment", is one arrow away, that is, a distance of tens of meters, less than 100 meters.

2) After contemplating the Refuge Field, practice the Four Refugees in the face of the Refuge Field, and recite the Refuge in the Dharma Book.

3) After devotional practice of taking refuge, it is necessary to cultivate the devotional mind.

In order to save sentient beings, we need to generate bodhicitta and the four immeasurable minds, and recite the text on sending hearts in the Dharma book.

142

Teachers' Merit Field


##### 4. The Seven Branch Practice - Mandala Offerings

After offering the mandala to visualize the merit field, the seven aspects of devotional practice are to be performed.
The seven branch practices are: 

1. prostration, the antidote to pride
2. offering, the antidote to avarice 
3. confession, the antidote to aggression 
4. rejoicing, the antidote to jealousy
5. requesting to turn the wheel of Dharma, the antidote to ignorance
6. requesting not to pass into parinirvana, the antidote to wrong views
7. dedication of merit, the antidote to doubts

These seven parts are called the seven branch practice offering.

The seven branch practice is from the "Huayan Sutra • Samantabhadra Bodhisattva's Vows". The long part of the Samantabhadra's Vows is very detailed about the Ten Great Vows of Samantabhadra. You can look at them, including the seven branch practice.

The offering of the seven branches is a very important practice method. Not only ordinary people, but also great bodhisattvas often practice the offering of the seven branches.

For example, when the bodhisattvas in the Pure Land of the Medicine Buddha in the East go to the Western Paradise of Ultimate Bliss, once they arrive in the Western Paradise of Ultimate Bliss, what the bodhisattvas do is to make offerings of the seven branches: first, prostrate and make offerings to Amitabha, and then rejoice with the merits of the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas in the Paradise of Ultimate Bliss. Confess in front of the Bodhisattva, and then ask Amitabha to preach the scriptures and preach the Dharma, and ask Amitabha to live forever in the world, and finally dedicate the merit.

When we meet our own guru, we also have to make offerings of the seven branches.

First bow to the guru; make offerings of one’s body, speech, and mind; confess any bad deeds; rejoice in the guru’s merits; ask the guru to teach the sutras and teach the Dharma; pray for the guru to live in the world forever;

That's why the seven branch practice  is very important.

In addition, the purpose of making offerings to the seven branches here is to accumulate merit and remove obstacles, which is of great help to clearly visualize the merit field.

144

##### (1) Prostration

In all the worlds of the ten directions, all the people of the three worlds, teachers and children, with my pure body, speech, and mind, all the rites are complete.

Prostration refers to the prostration of body, speech and mind.

The first is the general gift.

Facing the merit field, with the most sincere heart, with pure body, speech, and mind, prostrate before all the Buddhas, Tathagatas and Bodhisattvas in the ten directions and three times.

It also includes the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas in the merit fields.

The ten directions refer to east, south, west, north, southeast, southwest, northeast, northwest, up and down.

Three times refers to the past, present, and future.

##### 1) Prostration with the body

The body prostrates before the divine power of Samantabhadra, and before all Tathagatas appear, he reappears in the body of the dust, and bows to the Buddhas one by one.

First of all, you must have confidence in Samantabhadra Bodhisattva's vast deeds and vows. On this basis, you must recite the names of all the Buddhas in the ten directions and three times in your mind, as shown in the merit field, right in front of you.

Then visualize yourself transforming into a body equal to the number of dust particles in the buddha-field, and prostrating in front of the buddhas one by one.

145

There are many kinds of prostration, including prostration in Theravada, prostration in Mahayana Buddhism, and prostration in Tantra.

These salutes are based on the classics, and they can eliminate karmic obstacles and help accumulate blessings.

The most complete obeisance in Mahayana Buddhism is the prostration.

Bend the thumbs of both hands to the palms, and put the palms together in a hollow shape, which looks like a wish-fulfilling treasure.

First of all, put your palms together on the top of your head to "prostrate to your guru", which has three functions: you can be reborn in a pure land; you can eliminate the karma that goes against your guru; and you can receive the guru's blessing.

Secondly, putting the palms together on the forehead to "prostrate to the Buddha" also has three functions: it can eliminate the karma of not respecting the Buddha and Buddha statues; obtain the blessings of the Buddhas and Tathagatas; eliminate heavy karma created by the body, such as killing, stealing, sexual immorality, etc.

Thirdly, putting the palms together to "prostrate to the Dharma" also has three functions: it can eliminate the karma of disparaging the Dharma; obtain the blessing of the Dharma;
eliminate the karma created through non-virtuous speech, such as lying. 

Finally, putting the palms together over the heart to "prostrate to the Sangha" also has three functions: to eliminate the karma of disrespecting the Sangha's treasure.

Bodhisattvas are the holy Sangha; Arhats and transcendent Dharma protectors belong to the Sangha; obtaining the blessings of Sangha, we obtain the blessings of Bodhisattvas, Arhats, and transcendent Dharma protectors; eliminate the karma generated by the mind, such as greed, anger, clinging to wrong views, etc.

146

Then open the palms of the hand, stretch the arms forward, and visualize the wish-fulfilling jewels in the palm of the hand becoming innumerable, as offerings to the Buddhas, Tathagatas, and Guru Three Jewels.

Next, throw the whole body on the ground, stretch out the body, and pay homage to the Three Jewels of the Guru.

It is said in the scriptures that after saluting like this, future rebirths will obtain the blessing of the wheel-turning throne a thousand times the number of dust particles on the ground compressed by the body.

Therefore, some masters say that if you know that the prostration has these qualities, you will wish you were taller and your hands and feet were longer.

Because the Three Jewels of the Guru are the most profound and perfect merit field, whatever deeds you perform will bear fruit, and you will feel the good fruit of being respected by others, and you will be respected by others from generation to generation.

Many people are not respected in society, and their words and actions are not taken seriously; or they are not respected at home, their children
contradict them, etc. Prostration will soon change all this.

Prostration can also combat arrogance and pride, and prostration is also a method of whole-body exercise, which can cure many serious diseases.

##### 2) Rejoice

>
>In each dust particle, there are Buddhas as numerous as dust particles,
>
>And each Buddha attends assemblies of Bodhisattvas.
>
>As the dust particles in the boundless dharma realm are the same,
>
>I deeply believe that they all are graced by Buddhas.
>

First contemplate the various merits and virtues of the Buddhas and Tathagatas in the heart, and praise and rejoice.

147

Then imagine that in every particle of dust, there are innumerable Buddhas, more than the the number of dust particles in the universe, preaching sutras and teachings to the assemblies of Bodhisattvas, and convinced that this is the case in the endless dharma realms of the ten directions, and every world is filled with Buddha Tathagata.

Or imagine that in every mote of dust in our southern Jambudvipa continent, there are Buddhas and Bodhisattvas in the merit field filling the void, and at the same time arousing great reverence, devotion, and joy to the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas. This is the intention to prostration.

When bowing with your mind, you should visualize many Buddhas and Bodhisattvas in your heart, especially you must be able to visualize your root guru clearly, and you must have great pure trust in and joy towards your guru.

Then, we must also consider the merits of the body, speech, and mind of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas, and the merits of the guru's body, speech, and mind.

The more you think about it, the more your faith and desire will increase, and your mind will become purer. This is also a kind of prostration.

##### 3. Prostration of Speech

>
>Each copy of myself sends forth an ocean of sounds,
>
>Speaking limitless wonderful words endlessly
>
>Unto all kalpas to come,
>
>Praising the ocean of profound merits of Buddhas.
>

Visualize that there are innumerable pores on your body, each pore has innumerable heads, each head has innumerable mouths, and each mouth is reciting the praises of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas.

In this way, there are infinite sounds.

148

Praise the endless merits of all Buddhas and Bodhisattvas in the ten directions and three times, including the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas in the merit field.

Such a compliment is very special.

#####  (2) Offering

>
>Taking splendid wonderful garlands,
>
>Instrumental music, solid perfumes, and canopies,
>
>Such superb adornments as these,
>
>I offer them all to Tathāgatas.
>

>
>Taking superb garments, choicest incense,
>
>Powdered incense, incense for burning, and lamps and candles,
>
>Each and every item in an amazingly lofty pile,
>
>I offer them all to Tathāgatas.
>

The second branch is the offering branch. There are two types of offerings here: the superior offering and the supreme offering.

These two verses are about making offerings, which are offerings made with worldly offerings.

There are ten offerings here:

##### 1. Miaohua is a strange flower that can only be found in the heavens.

##### 2. The flower garland is made from various wonderful flowers.

##### 3. Tones are the sounds made by all kinds of wonderful musical instruments.

##### 4. Incense powder made of various wonderful fragrances.

##### 5. The most wonderful and solemn among the canopies.
##### 6. The most beautiful of clothes.

##### 7. The most beautiful fragrance is the perfume that fills the three thousand great thousand worlds.

##### 8. Incense powder made of various wonderful incense can be burned and can also be used as a mandala.

##### 9. Burning Incense A single or synthetic spice that emits an aroma when burned.

##### 10. Lamps Various scented oil lamps, or jewelry that emits light, etc.

"Miaogao gathers", Miaogao refers to Miaogao Mountain, which is Mount Sumeru.


Visualize using these ten most extraordinary offerings, piled up one by one as high as Mount Sumeru, and make offerings to the Buddhas and Tathagatas.

There are many ways to make offerings, there are two common ones, making physical offerings in person and mental offerings.

For example, if you want to make offerings of flowers, you should offer your own flowers; while offering flowers, visualize countless flowers and make offerings to Buddhas and Bodhisattvas.

It is also necessary to recite the offering text, the simple offering text is "Om ah hum, om ah hum, om ah hum, make offerings to the three jewels of the guru".

"Om ah hum" represents the body, speech and mind of the Buddhas and Tathagatas.

With the first "Om Ah Hum", the offerings are transformed from impure to pure; the second time, the blessing offering became nectar-like body, the flower became nectar-like flower, the water became nectar-like water, and the nectar-like nature,this to be able to exorcise demons, cure diseases, live a long life, etc. 

The third time, the offerings become innumerable.

The common merit of making offerings is to gain wealth.

In addition, each offering also has its own different merits.

For example, offering water, because water is pure, in addition to obtaining wealth, a water offering can also purify the mind; 

Offering lamps, because the lamps are bright, so offering lamps can open up wisdom; 

Offering flowers, they will look fresh and beautiful; 

various offerings 

If you plant fruits and other food, you will have no shortage of food in this life; 

if you make offerings of houses, such as building a temple, or building a house for your guru, the merit is to be reborn in the pure land; 

if you offer an umbrella, you will not have troubles; 

if you offer a throne, you will be promoted; 

If you make offerings to the wish-fulfilling treasures, you will have wishes fulfilled; 

if you make offerings of jeweled banners, you will gain prestige.

150

Different offerings have their own merits.

If you have these things yourself, make offerings of your own things.

If not, you can make offerings through mental visualization.

Visualize the blessings that you have accumulated in your lifetimes, which have come from various offerings, and become countless incense, flowers, water, lamps, as well as spices, fruits, musical sounds, etc., arranged in a solemn arrangement to make offerings to Buddhas and Bodhisattvas.

Since the above are offerings made with worldly objects, they are called superior offerings.

Then there is the supreme offering.

>
>With a mind of vast, excellent understanding,
>
>I deeply believe in all Buddhas of the past, present, and future.
>
>With the power of the universally worthy actions and vows,
>
>I make offerings to all Tathāgatas.
>

For example, sages or bodhisattvas make offerings of things beyond the world such as wish-fulfilling trees and nectars, as well as offerings made by great bodhisattvas using supernatural powers.

151

The supreme offering that we ordinary people can make is to make offerings to Buddhas and Bodhisattvas with various "vast and enlightened minds".

Including the bodhicitta of saving sentient beings from samsara; 

and the mind of turning all the good roots into offerings to the Buddhas with the power of faith and vows to the Buddhas like diamonds, and so on, and then through the blessing of the great vows of Samantabhadra Bodhisattva, 

Make offerings to the Buddhas and Tathagatas in the way of Samantabhadra.

The Samantabhadra Cloud Offering is: 

First, visualize yourself transformed into Samantabhadra Bodhisattva, sitting on a white elephant with six tusks, 

holding a wish-fulfilling jewel in his hand, 

and then visualize the wish-fulfilling jewel emitting twenty-five rays of light, 

and there is another one in each rays of light. 

Samantabhadra Bodhisattva, the wish-fulfilling jewel of each Samantabhadra emits twenty-five rays of light, and there is Samantabhadra in the light.

Continue to contemplate in this way until the entire sky is filled with Samantabhadra.

Then visualize the wish-fulfilling treasures in the hands of each Samantabhadra Bodhisattva transforming into various offerings, making offerings to the Buddhas and Tathagatas, and at the same time reciting the offering Offering Clouds Dharani:

>
>Namo Ratna Trayaya
>
>Om Namo Bhagawate
>
>Benza Sara Tramar Dhane
>
>Tatagataya Arhate 
>
>Samyak Sambuddhaya
>
>Teyata: Om Benze Benze
>
>Maha Benze
>
>Maha Tedzo Benze
>
>Maha Vidya Benze
>
>Maha Bodhicitta Benze
>
>Maha Bodhi Mendopa 
>
>Samtramana Benze
>
>Sarwa Karma Awarana
>
>Bishodhana Benze
>
>Soha!
>

---

>
>Homage to the Three Jewels.
>
>Homage to the Blessed One,
>
>the Vajra Decimator of Strife,
>
>the Tathagata, the Destroyer of the Enemy,
>
>the Consummately Perfect Buddha!
>
>So it goes: Om to the Vajra, to the Vajra,
>
>the Magnificent Vajra,
>
>the Magnificent Light Vajra,
>
>the Magnificent Awareness Vajra,
>
>the Magnificent Enlightened Attitude Vajra,
>
>the Magnificent Circle of Enlightenment,
>
>the Vajra that moves through every stage,
>
>the Tamer of all Karmas,
>
>the Vajra of Purity:
>
>Svaha!!
>

---

After reciting this mantra three times, if you make offerings of a flower, the flower will appear as innumerable rains of flowers on the pure land of every Buddha and Bodhisattva; if you offer a cup of tea, a cup of tea will appear in front of every Buddha and Bodhisattva. 

This is the power of the Samantabhadra cloud offering.

##### (3) Confession

>
>The evil deeds I have committed in the past
>
>With my body, voice, and mind
>
>Were all caused by greed, anger, and delusion, without a beginning in time.
>
>I now repent of all of them.
>

Whether you are a Buddhist or a non-Buddhist, our body, speech, and mind have created a lot of karma from rebirth to rebirth due to greed, hatred, and delusion.

The result of karma is suffering and falling into the evil realms. Therefore, it is very important to eliminate karma through repentance. This is the branch of repentance.

There are many kinds of karmic obstacles, among which the karma of breaking the precepts is particularly large. For example, if you break the precepts after taking the five vows, you will have commmitted a great sin.

Therefore, before we take the five vows, we must first consider whether we can keep the vows or not. If not, we can temporarily waive the five precepts, or we can take one or two vows first.

There are also people who break the Bodhisattva vows after taking the bodhisattva precepts. They will also have serious karma. These karmic obstacles need to be repented to eliminate.

So, how do we repent? We confess in front of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas according to the four powers.

153

We sincerely take refuge in the guru, the Three Jewels are the power of reliance; reciting the mantras of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas, the four refuges, the Hundred-syllable mantra, and the Thirty-five Buddhas of Confession texts are the antidotes; the attitude that regrets the deeds committed is the power of abandonment; After making a vow not to do it again, to have such a determination is the power of renunciation.

With these four powers, one can repent and eliminate karma.

##### (4) Rejoice

>
>Over the merits of all sentient beings in the ten directions,
>
>Ones who are still learning from the Two Vehicles, others who have nothing more to learn,
>
>And all Tathāgatas and Bodhisattvas,
>
>I express my sympathetic joy.
>

The fourth branch is the  branch of rejoicing, which brings the merit of rejoicing.

Rejoice in the merits of the Buddhas and Tathagatas, the merits of Bodhisattvas, and the merits of Arhats; also rejoice in the merits of those who have learned and those who have nothing more to learn.

What is learning? Among the five paths and ten levels (bhumis) of cultivation, practitioners who are on the path of accumulation, the path of joining, the path of seeing, and the path of meditation are called learning, and those who are liberated are beyond learning.

In the Mahayana, the five paths describe the entire spiritual journey, from its very beginnings with the taking of the bodhisattva vow and the generation of relative bodhichitta, up until its culmination at the stage of complete enlightenment.

Along the first four of the five paths, the thirty-seven factors of enlightenment are undertaken and perfected, and present thereafter as qualities of enlightenment.

Also rejoice in the merits of ordinary people and lay people.

When you are happy, pay attention to sending true joy.

When you rejoice in the merits and virtues of others, if your intentions are the same as those of the person you wish to rejoice in, you can get the same merits and blessings as the other person; 

if your intentions are bigger, you will get more merits and virtues than the other party; 

If you harbour ill-will or envy, you will not get any of the blessings of the other party. 

It is necessary for Buddhas and Bodhisattvas to have no selfishness in their intentions, and everything they do is for the benefit of all sentient beings.

Pay attention to the attitude being emitted.

154

If we rejoice in the merits of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas with such great motivation, we can obtain the blessings of Buddhas.

But our motivation is definitely not that great, and it is impossible to obtain such great merit.

It is also very easy to develop a joyful mind, which can be cultivated anytime, anywhere.

You can do it while you are lying down, and you can do it while you are reading.

At times we should read the biographies of Buddhas, Bodhisattvas and great achievers, such as the biographies of Buddha Shakyamuni. We should pay attention to two aspects. One is to study Buddha Sakyamuni, and the second is to rejoice in Buddha's achievement.

The same is true when reading the biography of Master Tsongkhapa. The first is to learn about Master Tsongkhapa. What books and sutras did he read and study in his life? We should also read and study them. The second is to follow Master Tsongkhapa’s instructions joyfully.

In addition, when meditating on joy, it is easy to find the object of one's mind.

For example, if we want to rejoice in the merits and virtues of the Sangha, just think about the merits of monks in all the temples in the world, including those in Tibetan and Han regions. Such a moment of joy can accumulate a lot of blessings.

Applied to cutting off afflictions, being happy for others can counteract jealousy.

#####  (5) Request the turning of the Wheel of Dharma

>
>I now request
>
>All Buddhas, the world-illuminating lamps, in the ten directions,
>
>Who have already attained the great bodhi,
>
>To turn the unsurpassed wondrous Dharma wheel.
>

The fifth branch is asking to turn the wheel of Dharma. To turn the wheel of Dharma is to teach the scriptures and spread the Dharma.

When a Bodhisattva first became a Buddha, he would not take the initiative to preach the scriptures and spread the Dharma. Someone needed to ask for the Dharma. If no one asked for the Dharma, the Buddha would pass away (parinirvana) and leave the world.

After Boddhisattva Shakyamuni became a Buddha, he did not teach the Dharma for forty-nine days, seven weeks, because no one asked for the Dharma.


Forty-nine days later, Indra and Brahma went to seek the Dharma. Indra offered a conch shell, and Brahma offered a golden wheel.

After these offerings and seeking the Dharma, Shakyamuni Buddha began to teach the first turning on the Four Noble Truths, the second on the Dharma of Emptiness, and the third on the Dharma of Buddha Nature. He taught 84,000 Dharma doors.

Now, we visualize that the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas in the merit fields are also first-time Buddhas, and we have also come to seek the Dharma.

Visualize yourself as Indra or Brahma, or you can just be yourself, hold a golden wheel or conch shell in your hand, make offerings to the Buddhas, and then ask the Buddhas to teach the sutras and spread the Dharma, and to save all sentient beings.

As mentioned earlier, the scriptures say that all Buddhas and Tathagatas will transform into teachers to save sentient beings.

In this way, there are countless masters who are manifestions of Buddhas and Tathagatas, teaching scriptures and spreading the Dharma in our southern Jambudvipa continent.

156

Requesting the Dharma is very important.

The fourth Panchen Lama lived to be ninety-three years old. A few years before the Lama passed away, his disciples thought that he was too old to teach the scriptures every day and that he should reduce his workload.

After a while, when the Fourth Panchen Lama saw that no one was requesting the Dharma, and that what he had to do in the world had been done, he passed away.

Requesting the Dharma can also eliminate the karma of disparaging the Dharma.

Requesting the Dharma and teaching the scriptures can save many sentient beings, so requesting the Dharma can also accumulate great blessings.

Once we understand this, we should always request the Dharma from our guru.

##### （6）Asking the Guru to stay in the world

>
>If Buddhas desire to manifest parinirvāṇa,
>
>I beseech them with utmost sincerity
>
>To abide for as many kalpas as there are dust particles in all lands
>
>And to benefit and delight all sentient beings.
>

What does it mean to ask the gurur to stay in the world? It is to ask Buddhas, Bodhisattvas, and teachers not to pass away, to live in the world forever, and to benefit all sentient beings.

Buddhas and Bodhisattvas are free to come and go, and free to leave the world when they pass away.

Therefore, if someone asks the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas to stay in the world, the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas will not pass away, and they can spend more time benefitting sentient beings.

157

When Dharma Master Yongzeng was eighty-five years old, he suddenly fell ill one day. He was so ill that he couldn't drink any water, and the doctors could not do anything about it.

At that time, in Qinghai, 80% to 90% of the people who studied Buddhism were disciples of Dharma Master Yongzeng, and the disciples went to ask the Dharma Master to live longer.

Everyone knelt down in front of the Dharma Master and wouldn't get up. After kneeling like this for more than half an hour, Dharma Master Yongzeng said, "Let's all get up, how long do you want me to live?" An old lama who was kneeling at the front said, "One hundred years old."

His Holiness thought for a while and said, "If you are a hundred years old, ninety-seven or ninety-eight years old is the same as a hundred years old."

Allowing for leap years, one hundred years old was actually around ninety-seven or ninety-eight years old.

Although the request was not very good, His Holiness still promised to live to be a hundred years old.

From that day on, His Holiness began to recover, and he was able to teach scriptures again. Even well into his nineties, he could still teach scriptures for six hours a day.

When he was ninety-seven years old, the Dharma Master said that all the sentient beings he was supposed to save had been saved, and that it would be meaningless to stay in the world, so he truly passed away.

If your teachers are ill, some of them seriously ill, for the benefit of ourselves and all sentient beings, we should ask them to stay in the world for a long time.

Maybe if you pray today, you will be fine tomorrow. Many teachers get sick because they cultivated the bodhicitta of self-exchange and absorbed the diseases and disabilities of other sentient beings.

In addition, for disciples, if they ask their master to live forever, they will live longer and increase their blessings.

158

In Tibet, there is a ritual for asking the guru to stay, and you can practice according to this ritual.

Now, let's make a simple prayer to ask the guru to stay in the world: 

First, visualize a lotus throne with a crossed vajra, and then visualize that such a throne is offered to every buddha, buddha and bodhisattva in the merit field. They all accept the throne happily; then, visualize yourself in front of the Buddha and Bodhisattva, bowing down respectfully, and asking the Buddha and Bodhisattva to live forever; finally, visualize the Buddha and Bodhisattva on the throne accepting the prayer, agreeing with us, and continuing to live for hundreds of years. Even if there is a major disaster, they will never pass away.

##### （7）Dedication of merit

>
>The roots of goodness developed from my obeisance, praises, and offerings,
>
>From my repentance and sympathetic joy,
>
>And from my requesting Buddhas to abide in the world to turn the Dharma wheel
>
>Are all transferred to sentient beings and the Buddha Way.
>


The last branch is the branch of the dedication of merit, which is to dedicate all the good roots and merits generated by the six branches of prostration, making offerings, rejoicing, repenting, requesting the turning of the Dharma wheel, and asking the Buddhas to stay in the world for the benefit of all sentient beings.

The merits of practice must be dedicated, and all of them must be dedicated to attaining Buddhahood, and dedicated to helping all sentient beings get rid of suffering and achieve happiness.

The bigger the motivation, the greater the merit. If you only dedicate it to your parents and children, you will get as much merit as these few people.

159

If you dedicate to the six realms to sentient beings, and there are countless sentient beings in the six realms, the blessings will become innumerable; however much merit takes for sentient beings to get rid of suffering and achieve happiness, the dedication will have just as much merit.

In addition, after doing the dedication, the merit will not be eliminated, otherwise, it will be eliminated as soon as you get angry.

For example, if you get angry with a Bodhisattva, you will eliminate the merit accumulated over a hundred kalpas, or even a thousand kalpas in an instant.

Except for the merit of emptiness, the merit of prostrations, making offerings, etc. will all be eliminated, but the dedication will not.

Good fortune is like a glass of water. There are many obstacles, for example, someone might pour it out, or it might be dried by the sun, but if you pour this glass of water into the sea, the sea doesn’t dry up, the glass of water doesn’t dry up. It has become part of the sea forever, so dedication is very important.

##### 5. Mandala Offering

After the offering of the mandala is completed, the mandala can be offered as thirty-seven-point or seven-point offerings several times.
Please refer to "The Treasures of the Dharma Sea" 2 for the offering of Mandala.

##### 6. Pray with the heart, Teach with the heart
160


Then, pray with a sincere heart of faith in the Three Jewels of the Guru and strong faith.

For example: I pray to the guru, the Three Jewels, to bless me to achieve the Three Paths, especially to realize the concept of impermanence in life, to be able to realize the impermanence of life, to generate renunciation, to obtain bodhicitta, etc.

After praying, visualize the Buddhas, Tathagatas, Arhats, and Dharma protectors in the merit field, all turning into light, from the outside to the inside, in turn merging into the body of the Benevolent Vajradhara.

Then visualize the gurus around the root guru, merging into the body of the root guru, as well as their respective thrones.

Next, visualize the root guru sitting on top of your head, facing in the same direction as you, Facing the Benevolent Vajradhara, and begin to correct your practice.

##### (2) Right View 

According to the above-mentioned "the root of the way is to get close to the master", slowly cultivate and meditate until the belief that "the master is the Buddha" arises in the heart, and becomes stronger day by day.

After completing the right view practice, you must dedicate it to the merit field.

Visualize the root guru on your head blending into the heart of Benevolent Vajradhara, so that Vajradhara merges into the guru.

Continue to visualize, Guru Vajradhara becomes smaller and smaller, and finally, shrinks to an inch in size, descends through the central channel on the top of your head, and then visualize your heart turning into an eight-petalled lotus with a moon wheel flat on the lotus. Guru Vajradhara sits upright on the moon wheel, the lotus petals slowly close, and your heart is indistinguishable from that of Guru, Buddha Shakyamuni, and Vajradhara.

161

##### (3) Completing the practice

Completing the practice is the end of the practice of the right view.

Generally, it is to recite the vows such as "Samantabhadra's Vows", and then make a great dedication.

##### 2. Daily Meditation 

If you have time, you should read more sutras on the Buddha's teaching, or the biographies of the great masters of the guru's lineage.

For example, Naropa served Guru Tilopa, Milarepa served Guru Marpa, Dromtonpa served his Master Saizumba, Venerable Atisha, and so on.

These are good examples, and we should learn from our elders.

In addition, in order to prevent afflictions, obstructions to the practice, and protect the root door of daily life, do not watch or listen to things that will cause afflictions.

162

#### Section 6 - Qualities and Requirements of a Disciple

##### 1. Qualities of a disciple

To be a guru, there are certain conditions and requirements, and to be a disciple, one must also have a disciple's virtues. A disciple without virtues will also hinder his study.

The "Four Hundred Stanzas on the Middle Way" by Aryadeva say:

>
>The mind is wise and seeking to make progress, 
>
>this is called the instrument for hearing the Dharma.
>

That is to say, disciples who hear the Dharma must possess the three virtues of morality, wisdom, and seeking to improve.

##### (1) Righteous Heart 

The first virtue is righteous heart.

Righteousness of mind means to be mentally normal and not to hold wrong views.

Because even a person with a normal mind will not believe in the righteous Dharma when the merits are not enough, when the attitude is not right and if they hold wrong views.

The other meaning of xinzheng is not to have a sectarian bias, which is called "right living" in the broad theory.

The sects are the schools, that is to say, one must not have any sectarian attachments when studying Buddhism, and only love one’s own school and look down on other schools. In this way, you will not be able to see the merits and virtues of good teachers, and you will not be able to comprehend the Dharma and the meaning of the good teachers.

163

##### (2) Wisdom 

The second virtue is wisdom.

Dharma-hearing disciples must be wise enough to be able to distinguish between good and evil, and to be able to distinguish whether the teaching is true Dharma or a false Dharma that is similar to a true Dharma.

##### (3) Seeking to make progress 

The third virtue is seeking to make progress.

As a disciple who listens to the Dharma, one must be diligent, not slack or lazy.

##### 2. Requirements for disciples

There are very few masters who have all the virtues, and it is very, very rare to find one.

There are very few qualified disciples.

Let's think about it, there are seven or eight billion people in the world, of which Buddhists only make up a very small part; and among Buddhists, there are even fewer who have the requirements for discipleship, and those who have heard the extraordinary teaching of the Three Aspects of the Path even rarer. 

I don't know how many lifetimes of merit I had to accumulate before I had the chance to hear about the Three Aspects of the Path.

164

Therefore, it is rare to find a master and a disciple who meet the requirements, and it is even more rare that the two can meet and teach and learn the true Dharma.

Therefore, once you have met a rare teacher, as a disciple, you must cherish this extraordinary good fortune and study hard.

##### (1) Disciples should always request the teaching 

Dharma disciples should frequently ask their masters to teach the scriptures and explain the Dharma.

It is best to ask the master more than three times for each teaching, and the more times you ask, the better.

The more you seek and request the Dharma, the more merit you will accumulate.

Seeking the Dharma can also remove the karma of disparaging the Dharma.

The karma of disparaging the Dharma is very large, equivalent to the karma of killing an arhat. 

This is not an ordinary karma. Only by seeking the Dharma can this karma be eliminated.

Seeking the Dharma can also remove the karma of defaming the Dharma.

Requesting the teaching of the Four Noble Truths will eliminate the karma of defaming the Four Noble Truths. If you ask for the teaching of Three Aspects of the Path and the Stages of the Path, you can eliminate the karma of slandering the 84,000 methods, because the order of the path is the essence of the 84,000 methods. The Three Aspects of the Path is the outline of the order.

When Dharma Master Yongzeng was alive, he required his disciples to request the Dharma every year.

In summer, the sutras are taught every day, and the disciples request for the Dharma once a day.

It doesn’t matter if you can’t ask for it. During the festivals, you have to offer Hada to your guru. Requesting once at this time is equivalent to asking for all the Dharma for a year, and the merit is very great.

165

##### (2) Dharma Disciples Should Eliminate the Defects of the Three Vessels

The three faulty vessels are: a covered vessel, a leaky vessel, and an unclean vessel.

If a disciple who hears the Dharma cannot get rid of the three faulty vessels, it will seriously hinder their generation of the three kinds of wisdom of hearing, thinking, and cultivating.

##### 1. Covered Vessels 

Covered Vessels are like pots with lids, or cups with lids.
When listening to the Dharma, even if the Dharma door taught by the master is excellent, if you don't listen carefully to it, it is like a cup with a lid on it.

Therefore, when listening to the Dharma, you must concentrate all your attention on listening. If your mind is distracted, it will be the same as not listening to the Dharma.


##### 2. Leaky Pots

After listening attentively, you cannot forget what you have heard. Think more in your heart: "What did the master say today?"
It must be reviewed repeatedly, otherwise it will be forgotten, just like a pot with a leak at the bottom, no amount of nectar can be kept.

That is to say, although you listen carefully and your motivation for listening to the Dharma is correct, if you do not review and consolidate the Dharma in your mind shortly after hearing it, you will forget whatever you were taught, and it will not help you in your study and meditation.

##### 3. Unclean Vessels

It is very important to express your mind when you hear about the troubles of eliminating unclean devices.
The best motivation is to generate Bodhicitta, to listen attentively to the Dharma in order to save sentient beings, attain liberation and become a Buddha.

If the intention is not strong, it is like pouring nectar into an unclean vessel, and you cannot drink it, and it cannot be applied to study and meditation.


For example, some people listen to the Dharma in order to see and hear more; some people want to go out and show off and tell others; some people are interested in the stories retold by the master when he teaches the Dharma; some people don't even come to listen to the Dharma, they just want to see if the guru is wrong.

These are all incorrect motives. Such motives at light level will ignore the main points of the Dharma, and at a more serious level will lead to wicked attachments, and the further you go on the wicked path, evil karmic obstacles will be unleashed.

167

##### 三、##### 3. There are six kinds of thoughts that disciples who hear the Dharma should have

Dharma disciples should have six kinds of thoughts. 

When a disciple hears the Dharma, he should not only pay attention to eliminating the faults of the three vessels, but also have six kinds of thoughts, that is, an understanding of the six kinds of mentality.

##### (1) Think of yourself as a patient

Treat yourself as a patient suffering from afflictions and karma.

##### (2) See the guru as a doctor

Regard the master who teaches the Dharma as a doctor who can heal one's own afflictions and karma.

##### (3) See the Dharma as medicine

Regard the Dharma taught by the master as a top-grade medicine for curing afflictions and karma illnesses.

##### (4) Take the medicine

After studying, practicing, healing, and wanting to hear the Dharma, be like a patient who has received good medicine from a doctor. 

If you do not take the doctor's advice and take the medicine on time, you will still not be able to cure the disease.

In this case, the Buddha and the guru cannot do anything, and it is useless to teach no matter how advanced the Dharma.

Therefore, after hearing it, you must follow the teachings, practice and meditate diligently, in order to cure your afflictions and karma diseases.

##### (5) Thinking of the Buddha as a saint

The Buddha is regarded as the most perfect holy person with the most perfect merit, wisdom, blessings, and abilities. Only by thinking in this way can we have pure faith in the Dharma.

##### (6) Extensive meditation on the Dharma

See the Dharma as the most extraordinary treasure of wisdom, and pray for the Dharma to live forever in the world.

You should think like this: 

"Gracious Master taught me the righteous Dharma of the Buddha, such a precious treasury of wisdom, if it can live in the world for a long time, it will benefit countless sentient beings."

Then you have to be diligent, make great vows, have bodhicitta, and do your best to make the Dharma abide for a long time.

The above are the six types of thoughts that disciples need to have when they hear the Dharma.

To put it simply, first of all, realize that you are a patient suffering from afflictions, your guru is a doctor who treats the disease, the dharma taught by your guru is the medicine to cure the disease, and practicing is taking the medicine.

Also think: Not only do you have afflictions and diseases, but all sentient beings have afflictions and diseases. Therefore, you must do your best to tell others about the Dharma and techniques of treating illnesses, so as to benefit yourself and others.

169

##### 4. Etiquette 

As a teacher, when teaching the Dharma, one should show compassion and tolerance, and should not be arrogant or greedy for fame and fortune.

This is the attitude a teacher needs to have when he teaches the Dharma.

As a disciple, when listening to the Dharma, it is best to also generate Bodhicitta and desire for liberation: I want to become a Buddha and save sentient beings to listen to the teacher's teaching.

If you just think: I want to see if what this master is saying is correct... 

Wait, if you listen to the Dharma with this attitude, you will obtain no merit at all.

It is said in the Vinaya Sutra that there are thirty-six kinds of majesty to hear the Dharma, so I won't talk about that much here, just briefly.

When listening, the master should be on the seat, and the disciple should be below the level of the seat; if the master is stands and teaches the Dharma, and the disciples sit down and listen to the Dharma, this is incorrect.

When listening to a Dharma talk, you should take off your shoes and hats. People who are sick or with other special circumstances do not need to take them off.

When you listen, you can't bring weapons such as knives.

When listening, just concentrate on listening. Do not recite sutras or mantras aloud, and do not recite them silently.

170

When walking, the master should teach the Dharma in front and the disciples should listen from behind.

If the disciple is listening in front and the teacher is speaking at the back; or if the teacher is speaking on the side of the road and the disciple is listening in the middle of the road, it is not good for the Dharma.

#### Section 2 How to study after getting close to the guru

##### Chapter 1 - Precious Human Life

This part talks about the rarity and preciousness of human life.

The content includes: what is a precious human body; the value of a precious human body; the conditions for obtaining a precious human body; the rarity of a precious human body; cherishing a precious human body.

Many people have been studying Buddhism for a long time, and they recite sutras and mantras diligently every day. However, they may never have considered a problem, or they may never have  realized that it is a problem, which is about their own body, this body of flesh and bone. What does it have? What does it do?

We have to rely on this body to practice, to get rid of ignorance, and obtain happiness, through to liberation and becoming a Buddha.

So, we should know more about ourselves.

173

#### 1. What is a precious human body full of freedoms? 

To liberate ourselves and become a Buddha, one must use the body to practice.

However, everyone's physical conditions are different. For reaching liberation, what kind of human body is the most extraordinary? The most useful and precious thing is the precious human body full of freedom.

A precious human body full of freedom is a human body that has the eighteen conditions of eight freedoms and ten endowmwents.

##### (1) The eight freedoms of human beings

That is to say, those who wish to be liberated must not only respect and believe in the Three Jewels of the Guru, but also have the time and ability to hear, reflect, and practice the true Dharma. This is called freedom.

In order to understand the eight freedoms, one must first understand the eight flaws.

The eight flaws are the eight obstacles to the practice of Buddhism, four of which are adverse conditions for human beings, and four are adverse conditions for non-human beings.

The four adverse conditions of human beings are: 

A buddha has not come; Being born in uncivilized lands; to be deaf, dumb, and disabled or with incomplete faculties; to hold wrong views.

174

##### (1) A buddha has not come 

If you are born in an era where a buddha has not come, you will not be able to practice Buddhadharma, and it will be useless to take rebirth as a human being.

The era without Dharma is very, very long.

In Buddhism, "Kalpa" is often used as a unit of time.

According to Mahayana, a great kalpa lasts over 12.9 billion years.

Kalpas are divided into two categories: bright and dark. Bright kalpas refer to the kalpas in which a Buddha has been born and the light of the Buddha's Dharma exists.

A dark kalpa is a kalpa in which no Buddha is born.

The kalpa in which Buddha Shakyamuni descends is a bright kalpa, and a thousand Buddhas will appear in this kalpa, so it is called the sage kalpa, which means there are many sages.

The birth of a Buddha is very rare, and only one bright kalpa appears in countless dark kalpas.

It is said in the "Abhidharma-kośa-śāstra" that in the past there were five bright kalpas, but there were fourteen hundred dark kalpas.

Although there are many Buddhas born in bright kalpas, in so many dark kalpas, there is not even a single Buddha.

If you are reborn in a dark kalpa, you will never encounter the Buddha and the Dharma.

Not only that, even in bright kalpas, it is not always possible to encounter the Dharma.

In the early days of the bright kalpa, the life span of a human being is very long, almost as long as that of a deity, but at this time no Buddha will be born.

Then the human lifespan gradually decreases to 80,000 years, and only then did the Buddha begin to appear.

A Buddha will not appear before a life span of 80,000 years.

175

The origins of human races are very different.

Tibetans are descended from monkeys, which is recorded in the Tibetan historical book "Clear Mirror on Royal Genealogy".

Some races are descended from fish, some are descended from bears, and others are descended from various animals.

There are also descendants of dragons, Yakshas, ​​etc. These claims are all recorded in the classics.

The race of Buddha Shakyamuni descended from gods and men who came down to the Saha world. When he first came down, his lifespan was very long.

Later, the Shakya people gradually reduced their long, relatively infinite lifespan to a limited lifespan, that is, they could live up to 80,000 years. Other races did not have such a long lifespan.

From a lifespan of 80,000 years, the lifespan of human beings will decrease by one year every 100 years, and when Buddha Shakyamuni arrived in the human world, the lifespan was already reduced to only 100 years old.

Before Shakyamuni Buddha, three Buddhas were born. Shakyamuni Buddha is the fourth Buddha.

After the Dharma of the Burning Lamp Buddha was extinguished, it took a long, long time before Buddha Shakyamuni came into the world.

The teachings of Buddha Shakyamuni can last for 5,500 years in this world. After 5,500 years, the Buddhadharma will cease to exist, and there will be no Buddhadharma.

Now, more than 2,600 years have passed since the birth of Shakyamuni Buddha, almost half of the 5,500 years have passed, and there are only about 3,000 years left.

Therefore, if you don't cherish your precious human body this time and fall into the three evil realms, you are likely to miss the teaching period of Buddha Shakyamuni because the time you will have to spend in the three evil realms is very long.

176

It will take almost another 4.5 billion years until Maitreya Buddha is born.

That is to say, counting from now, more than 3,000 years will pass, then the 4.5 billion years when Maitreya Buddha will come into the world. People reborn in this world will not encounter the Buddhadharma, nor even hear the Buddha's name, nor will they be able to see any image of the Buddha.

For such a long period of time, no matter how many times a person is reborn as a human, it will not be a precious life full of freedom.

##### (2) Born in either a remote or a barbaric place where an enlightened being has never lived and taught. 

Even if you are reborn in an era when there is Buddhadharma, if you are born in an area where there is no Buddhadharma, such a human body will not be a perfect human body.

For example, if you are born in the Middle East, you will not be full of freedom.

Or even if you were born in an area where the Dharma exists, but you do not believe in the Dharma, you are not a perfect human being.

For example, in Tibet, it can be said that 99 percent of the people believe in Buddhism, but there are still some people who do not believe in Buddhism.

For example, belief in the Bon religion. The Bon religion is a primitive religion in Tibetan areas. It is not Buddhism. Such a person does not have a precious human life.

##### (3) Not possessing all the faculties of body and mind 

Deaf-mute or mentally-disabled persons will have many obstacles in their practice. They do not have the foundation to study the Dharma, nor is their life full of freedoms or endowments.

177

##### (4) Clinging to wrong views

Those who cling to wrong views, who do not believe in cause and effect, who are living under the blinding influence of grossly distorted attitudes and beliefs, do not have a precious human life.

Clinging to wrong views is the biggest obstacle to the way, so Nagarjuna Bodhisattva listed clinging to wrong views as the first of the eight flaws in the "Book of Relatives and Friends".

The above four are the adverse conditions of the human body.

##### 2. Four kinds of adverse conditions for non-human beings 

The four types of adverse conditions for non-human beings mean that upon rebirth, they are reborn in the three lower realms or as long-living gods. These four kinds of beings themselves do not have the conditions to practice Buddhism.

##### (1) Rebirth in hell

If the rebirth takes place in hell, the body and mind will be constantly occupied by pain, and there will be no way to practice at all, and there is no condition for freedom.

##### (2) Rebirth as a hungry ghost

If the rebirth takes place in the realm of hungry ghosts, because of extremely strong, constant hunger and thirst, they will only be able to look for food and drink, and there is no possibility of practicing the Dharma, and they have no freedoms.

178

#####  (3) Rebirth in the animal realm 


All beings in the animal realm are relatively ignorant and unable to practice, and they also have no freedoms.

##### (4) Rebirth in the realm of long-living gods

In the four heavens of the Formless Realm, the celestial beings of the Longevity Heaven just have the feeling of being born at the moment of their birth, and then they enter immediately into samādhi.

After entering samadhi, you will be as if in a coma. In this state, you can live for 80,000 kalpas. When you wake up, you will die, and you will fall into the evil realms in future rebirths.

Therefore, rebirth in the realm of long-living gods is not full of freedom or endowments.

Some people practice meditation indiscriminately, unaware that their minds have been lost in subtle drowsiness. After they die, they will be reborn as heavenly beings in the Formless Realm of Longevity.

##### (2) A precious human form having the eight freedoms

The opposite of having no freedoms is that we have opportunity, and our present human body is a human form having the eight freedoms.

A human form having the eight freedoms refers to those who were born in an era of Buddhism; in an area where there is Buddhism and belief in Buddhism; the six faculties are complete; we are not beings in hell; we are not hungry ghosts; we are not  animals; we are not long-living gods.

179

(3) The Ten Endowments 

The ten endowments include ten kinds of perfection: having a complete human body; being born in a land with a strong spiritual culture; having all the normal faculties; being free from having committed any of the five inexpiable karmic deeds; pure faith in the Three Jewels and having interest in the spiritual path.

The Ten endowments are further divided into personal endowments and environmental endowments.

One must be born as a human being who has the opportunity to practice the Dharma.

There are human beings in all four continents. Among the four continents, the people from the southern Jambudvipa continent are the smartest and the most wise; the people from the northern continent are very long-lived, and they can live a thousand years, but they are relatively stupid. If Shakyamuni Buddha was born in the Northern continet, it would be impossible to save so many sentient beings, because the sentient beings there are very stupid.

Why was Buddha born in India? 

Because the people who teach the scriptures and the Dharma must be able to understand the Dharma, the Indians at that time were very smart, so the Buddha Shakyamuni was born in India.

Being born in a land with a strong spiritual culture means the place where the Dharma exists and where the four groups of disciples of Buddhism exist: bhikkhus and nuns, upasakas and upasikas.
180

This kind of area is called Middle Earth, and it refers to an area where the esoteric method is well preserved.

The six sense faculties are the eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, and mind.
The eyes can read scriptures; the ears can hear the Dharma; the mouth can recite scriptures; the body can meditate and practice; the mind can distinguish between good and evil karma.

Only when the six faculties are complete can one listen, think, and meditate.

##### 4. Five inexpiable karmic deeds

The five inexpiable karmic deeds that have not been committed are: killing the father, killing the mother, killing an arhat, destroying the Sangha, and causing harm to the body and blood of a Buddha.
Those who have committed the five inexpiable karmic deeds have very heavy karma, and it is difficult for them to enter Buddhism.

Pure faith in the Three Jewels 

Belief in the Three Jewels and full confidence in the Three Jewels.
The above are the conditions that we should have, so these are called personal endowments. We have these five conditions ourselves.

181

##### 6. When the Buddha was born 

Although we were not born in the age of the Buddha, there are many incarnations of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas in the world today.
For example, now there are many teachers with perfect virtues who are teaching sutras and teachings, and meeting a master with perfect virtues will satisfy this condition.

When encountering Buddhas and teachings, some Buddhas are born in the human world. When people have no wisdom, no one seeks the Dharma. If a Buddha is born today, he may pass away the next day.
This is not the case with Buddha Shakyamuni. He lived in the human world for 80 years and taught scriptures and Dharma for 45 years.

After the Buddha's parinirvana, Venerable Atisha, Master Tsongkhapa, and other incarnations of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas also preached the scriptures and taught the Dharma. These extraordinary Dharma doors have been passed down to the present, and they all belong to the Dharma of encountering Buddhas.

Not only that, the teachings of Master Tsongkhapa, which are both exoteric and esoteric and pure in view and conduct, are the teachings that were revived by Master Tsongkhapa, in fact, Manjushri Bodhisattva himself.

This teaching has absorbed the essence of the old and new schools in India and Tibet, and has discarded all impurities. It is like pure gold after purification. It is extremely rare. It is really difficult to encounter such teachings.

182

The Fourth Panchen Lama once said: "Among the people who have attained a human body full of freedoms, the rarest are those who can practice both monasticism and tantra.

Because among the 84,000 dharma-doors, the only one that includes the teaching of the complete perfection of both the sutra and the tantra is the teaching of Master Tsongkhapa, and it is exceedingly rare to encounter such a teaching."

It illustrates the difficulty of obtaining a precious human life full of freedom and encountering the teachings of Master Tsongkhapa, and it also illustrates the greatness of Master Tsongkhapa's teachings.

##### 8. Dharma lives in the world 

The Buddhadharma exists in the world in which we have now been reborn. Not only does the Buddhadharma exist, but even the rare Buddhist Dharma that has been fully cultivated in both exoteric and esoteric practice still exists.

##### 9. Believing in Buddhism

We not only believe in Buddhism and convert to Buddhism, but also study Buddhist scriptures from our masters, so we have the condition to believe in Buddhism.

##### 10. Freedom to study

It is very rare to have the good fortune to learn and study the Dharma.

First of all, you need to meet a teacher who has the qualities of virtue; you need to have time to practice the Dharma; you need to know how to practice.

183

It seems that, fortunately, all of us here have this good fortune.

It is very rare to meet a truly virtuous guru who has not deceived the believers. This is one of the most important conditions for the environmental endowments.

Other important conditions are the environment for learning Buddhism and the pure lineage.

It is very important to have a group of Dharma friends with whom you can study together. Such an environment is very important. Everyone can learn from and encourage each other.

I have been to some places, and some people said that they were the only person in the area who was studying Buddhism, and it was very difficult.

Therefore, it is very painful not having a good environment for study and cultivation, and the luck of having a Dharma friend is rare, and it is also an important condition for study and cultivation.

Many people don't understand this principle, and they have a sense of distinction between Dharma friends and fellow practitioners. This is inappropriate. Everyone should cherish each other.

These five conditions require external fulfillment, so they are called environmental endowments.

The above eight freedoms and ten endowments, and a human body that fulfills all these eighteen conditions is a precious human being with the freedoms and endowments conducive to spiritual practice.

Sakya Mahasiddha Drakpa Gyaltsen said:

>
>Obtaining the precious human body filled with freedoms is not acquired by strength, 
>
>but is the fruit of the accumulation of merit.
>

184

That is to say, obtaining a human body with eight freedoms and ten endowments is not because of how powerful one's own abilities are, nor because of how outstanding one's status, wealth, and reputation are, but because of the accumulation of merit over many kalpas and the diligent practice of ten good deeds. This is how the good fruit is obtained.

Therefore, a person who is full of freedoms is also called a person with good qualities.

##### 2. The Value of a Precious Human Life 

Now, we must think about ourselves, whether we have obtained a Precious Human Body or not.

Think again, have you realized that the precious human body is really a very precious thing to have, and realized the value of the precious human body?

Relying on a precious human body can help you achieve countless benefits, so a precious human body is really a very, very valuable kind of human body.

##### (1) Obtaining a precious human body full of freedom can bring benefit in this present life and in future lives. 

Obtaining a precious human body full of freedoms can not only help gain longevity and wealth in this life, but also achieve success in the next life.

If you want to be a wealthy person in this life, you can use this body to do it. For example, through offering the mandala. 

Mandala offering is the fastest and best way to accumulate blessings.

If you want to be healthy and live a long life, you only need to have the cause of longevity, such as cultivating the Buddha of Longevity, releasing animals and so on.

185

In the next life, if you want to become a great god in the world like the King of Great Freedom, you can also do it with this body.

A person who is full of freedom and endowments can sow the causes that bring about these results.

##### (2) After obtaining a precious human body full of the freedoms, you can be reborn in any Pure Land. 

After obtaining a precious human body full of the freedoms, if you want to be reborn in the Western Paradise of Ultimate Bliss or the pure land of other Buddhas and Bodhisattvas in the next life, you can do it.

If you want to be reborn in the Western Paradise of Ultimate Bliss, as long as you recite the name Amitabha Buddha often, visualize the Paradise of Ultimate Bliss more, make more vows, make good blessings, and then dedicate the blessings to the Paradise of Ultimate Bliss, you can be reborn in the Paradise of Ultimate Bliss in the next life.

If you want to be reborn in the dakini pure land or other pure lands, you can also do this.

##### (3) After attaining a precious human body full of the freedoms, one can attain liberation and become a Buddha. 

After obtaining a a precious human body full of the freedoms, not only can one be reborn in the Pure Land. If one wants to be liberated in this lifetime, or become a Buddha immediately, one can do it.

Therefore, the a precious human body full of the freedoms is the most precious human body.

If you don't practice and make good use of such a human body, it's a huge waste.

In the "Guide to the Bodhisattva's Way of Life", it says:

186
>
>If you don't take advantage of this body to practice good deeds, 
>
>you will not be more mistaken than this, 
>
>and there is nothing more stupid than this.
>

To have a good body is to have a human body full of freedoms and endowments.

That is to say, if you don't earnestly perform good deeds after you obtain a precious human life, it will be the most stupid, the greatest mistake, and the biggest loss.

##### (4) Compared with being born in the Land of Ultimate Bliss, a person with precious human life can quickly become a Buddha. 

My great teacher, Gazang Qusong, said: "It is more difficult to obtain a precious human life full of freedom than to be born in the world of Ultimate Bliss. 

In terms of value, obtaining a precious human life full of freedom is far better than being born in the pure land of bliss !”

Why? Because even if you are born in the Land of Ultimate Bliss, becoming a Buddha will still be very difficult and the time it will take still very long.

In the Land of Ultimate Bliss, first Amitabha Buddha was the master, and after Amitabha had lived in the world for countless kalpas, Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva became the master of Ultimate Bliss, and then it was the turn of Mahasattva Bodhisattva.

When Amitabha was the master, some people lived in the Land of Ultimate Bliss and experienced countless kalpas, but failed to become a Buddha; when Avalokitesvara was the master, they went through countless kalpas and still failed to become a Buddha; In the time of the world, after going through countless kalpas, one can become a Buddha.

187

Because even though there is no suffering in the Land of Ultimate Bliss, and suffering is unheard of, you are very happy and will not return.

But just because there is no suffering, the accumulation of merit will be very slow.

Despite daily practice, becoming a Buddha is still a very slow and difficult process, so the Bodhisattvas of Ultimate Bliss made a vow: "I want to be born in a Saha world, get a precious human body full of freedoms, and become a Buddha quickly."

In the Saha world, after obtaining a precious human body full of freedom, if he is a Vajra disciple with the best foundation, he can become a Buddha in three years, three and a half months; an ordinary person with a lesser foundation can become a Buddha in seven years, or twelve years, or at least become a Buddha in this lifetime.

A day in the pure land of bliss is equivalent to hundreds of years in our world. We can become Buddhas after practicing in the Saha world for more than ten years, which may be equivalent to half a day or an hour or two in the pure land of bliss. Therefore, the bodhisattvas of the blissful world all vowed to be born in the Saha world, because the human body is too precious and rare.

##### (5) Compared with being born in the Land of Ultimate Bliss, a human body full of freedom is very, very precious.

Why? One of the reasons is that after learning Buddhism in this human body, the merits arising from the purity of the precepts are very fast, and the blessings obtained are also great.

188

Especially in the Saha world, when people's troubles are growing greater and greater, even if one precept is pure, the blessings will be huge.

At the time of the ending of the spread of Buddhism in India, the blessings of sentient beings decreased, and in the end, there were no more blessings, and the Dharma gradually disappeared.

After the Buddha Dharma disappeared in India, the Han and Tibetan areas of China continued to promote the Dharma.

The Buddhist teachings in these areas have also been destroyed several times. In the Han region, the three warring states destroyed the Buddha in a week, and in the Tibetan region, Langdarma destroyed the Buddha in the period prior to its revival.

Every time the Dharma is destroyed, the blessings that practitioners acquire by keeping the precepts cleanly increase a lot more than before.

In times when the Buddha's Dharma has not been destroyed, a bhikkhu in the Land of Ultimate Bliss purifying and practising more than 250 precepts for a hundred years would obtain the same blessings as a bhikkhu in a Saha world who kept the precepts for a day and night in times of the ending of the Dharma.

Before the Buddha Dharma was destroyed, keeping all the precepts pure and keeping the precepts for a hundred years, and keeping the precepts pure for one day and night after the Buddha Dharma was destroyed, the reward is the same.

This is because the magnitude of the merit of keeping the precepts is related to the difficulty of keeping the precepts.

The more difficult it is to keep the precepts, the greater the merit of being able to keep the precepts pure; the lower the difficulty, the smaller the merit.

It is very easy for monks in a Pure Land to keep the precepts.

Because there is no suffering in the Land of Ultimate Bliss, there are no obstacles to keeping the precepts, and the precepts will naturally be pure;

189

Therefore, keeping the precepts cleanly for hundreds of kalpas in the Land of Ultimate Bliss is the same as keeping the precepts cleanly for one day in the human world.

Especially when the Dharma has been destroyed, the merit of practice is greater, and the blessings grow faster. Unfortunately, not many people actually practice.

##### (6) Compared with being born in the Land of Ultimate Bliss, the time spent cultivating compassion and bodhicitta in a person who is full of leisure is short, and the blessings are great in the Land of Ultimate Bliss. 

Because there is no suffering, cultivating kindness and compassion for hundreds of kalpas is comparable to that of cultivating compassion in the Saha world in an instant. The merits are the same.

Similarly, the sentient beings in the Land of Ultimate Bliss themselves do not know what suffering is, let alone feel the suffering of other sentient beings and cannot generate the bodhicitta that saves all sentient beings from suffering and attains happiness. Bodhicitta is very difficult to generate.

##### 3. Conditions for Obtaining the Precious Human Body 

To obtain the Precious Human Body, three conditions must be met:

190

##### (1) Purity of the precepts 

The reason for obtaining a precious human body is the purification of the ten virtues.

Even if one obtains an ordinary human body, among the ten virtues, at least one of the precepts must be pure.

It is very, very difficult to achieve the ten virtues.

Don't kill, don't steal, don't commit adultery, don't tell lies, don't use divisive speech, don't speak harshly, don't gossip pointlessly, don't be greedy, don't hate, don't cling to wrong views. These are known as the ten virtues.

Taking only the first commandment, "Don't kill," is very difficult to do.

The ten virtues must be completely pure, so that in the next life one can obtain a precious human body of freedom and endowments. From this alone, one can see how difficult it is to obtain a precious human body of freedom and endowments.

##### (2) In order to attain the precious human body of freedom and endowments by practicing generosity and six perfections

In addition to the purity of the virtues, one must also practice the six perfections.

The Six Paramitas are also known as the Six Perfections. If you do not cultivate the Six Perfections, you will only obtain an ordinary human body. Only by practicing the Six Perfections can you obtain a precious human body that is capable, suitable for practice, and possesses various endowmments.

Even if you can't cultivate all of the six perfections, you must at least cultivate generosity, patience, meditation, and wisdom among the six degrees.

Giving includes Dharma Giving, Wealth Giving, and Fearless Giving. 

It is necessary to cultivate these three kinds of generosity. If you don’t cultivate generosity, you will not have the blessings of a happy and full human body.

191

You also need to cultivate forbearance. If you don’t cultivate forbearance, even if you get a precious human body, your appearance will be ugly.

If you don't practice meditation, even if you get a precious human body, your mind will not be easy to settle.

If you don't practice Prajna Paramita, you will have lower human intelligence.

If the appearance is not upright, the appearance is not solemn, and sentient beings will not be happy when they see it, and there will be a little obstacle in saving sentient beings.

Unsettled mind and lack of wisdom are all obstacles to practice.

##### (3) To make good vows 

To make good vows is to make pure vows, such as: "I wish to obtain a precious human body that is full of freedoms and endowments, and a human body that promotes the Dharma and benefits life."

Only by making such a wish can one obtain a precious human body.

This kind of special vow is also very difficult to initiate, because sentient beings are in samsara, their minds are always dominated by ignorance, purification is difficult, and it is even more difficult to generate this kind of vow.

##### 4. The rare nature of human beings with a precious human body 

The Buddha said that demons are like the dirt on the earth, and virtuous beings are like dust on the fingernails.

Among the six realms, the hell realm has the largest number of sentient beings, hundreds of times more than other realms.

There are also many sentient beings in the animal realm and in the hungry ghost realm, and the human beings in the heavenly realm are the fewest in number.

192

There are few virtuous sentient beings because it is difficult for sentient beings to do good deeds and keep good precepts.

There are many sentient beings in the evil realm because it is easy to do evil, so most sentient beings fall into the evil realm in later lives.

The Buddhist scriptures also say:

>
>Most people in the world tend to be unrighteous,
>
>Therefore, most people in the mortal world fall into the evil realms.
>

And among the human beings, 

the rarer ones are those who have obtained a precious human body full of freedoms.

There are three metaphors in the Buddhist scriptures, which illustrate the rare nature of a precious human body full of freedoms.

The first analogy is: 

There is a small plank floating on a vast ocean, and there is a hole in the middle of the plank.

There is a blind tortoise at the bottom of the sea that comes to the surface every hundred years.

When the tortoise sticks its head out of the water, what are the chances it will find the plank, and what are the chances the head can fit into the hole in the middle of the plank? We all know that this is almost impossible.

In this parable, the ocean is likened to the ocean of ​​samsara, the tortoise is likened to all beings, blindness is likened to ignorance, and the tortoise is like a human being when it emerges from the sea and enters the hole in the plank.

Therefore, everyone understands: Because of ignorance, we have been stuck in the six realms of rebirth, and it is very difficult to obtain a human body.

The second analogy is: 

Like tossing dried peas at a smooth wall

193

Even if the peas are thrown for a hundred years, not a single pea will stick to the wall.

After people die, they are like peas thrown against the wall, they fall into the evil realm one after another, and the chance to get a precious human life is rarer than dried peas sticking to a wall.

The third analogy is: 

A steel needle is stuck upside down on the ground, and mustard seeds are thrown at the tip of the needle. 

It is very difficult for the small mustard seeds to stay on the tip of the needle, and they all fall to the ground.

The same is true after death. It is almost impossible for a person not to fall into the evil realm, to be rescued, and to obtain a chance to be fully reborn in a precious human body.

In addition, Master Bodowa also has several metaphors for the rareness of the human body in the "Parables of Potowa":

>
>Insects worship and ride wild deer,
>
>and Zangba eats fish and fried dough.
>

Here there are four stories, the first one is the pilgrimage of insects. It refers to the story of a little worm in the ground, after burrowing out of the ground, worships the Buddha, saying that he takes refuge in the Three Jewels of the Guru. We all know this is almost impossible. This parable shows that after beings are freed from the evil realm, the possibility of gaining a human body is as rare as a bug that can worship.

The second story is riding a wild deer. 

This parable says that there was a blind man named Zhugu who fell off a cliff when he was walking because he could not see.

Just then, a wild deer happened to be walking at the bottom of the cliff, and Zhugu the blind man landed on the back of the wild deer, and then he hugged the wild deer tightly. When the wild deer calmed down, the blind man sang happily.

People on the side of the road asked him, what are you so happy about, you blind man. The blind man said, I am a blind man who fell off a cliff and didn’t fall to my death, and I landed on a wild deer, how can I be unhappy.

This story shows that after we fall into the evil realm, we can be rescued and get the chance to obtain a human body, just like a blind man riding a wild deer.

The third story is 'Zangba eats fish'. There was a person from the Zangba area. Once, when he came back home, his wife made fish for him to eat. Because he had never eaten fish before, he thought it was very fragrant, so he ate a lot of it, and he felt nauseous, and about to be sick.

Quickly, he immediately took off his shoelaces and tied them around his throat. His wife asked, "What are you doing?"

He said: "It would be a shame to vomit out the fish after I finally got it."

We should also cherish the time and life we ​​have obtained just like Tibetan people cherish fish and meat.

The fourth story is 'Fried Dough'.

One year there was a famine in Tibet, and everyone was short of food.

In one family, a father went out to beg for food, and he got a little fried tsampa, made some dough, and gave a little to everyone in the family.

There was a little child who was very ghostly. He hid the dough from his father behind his back, and then asked his father for more. His father gave him some more. After he ate it, he turned around and saw that the dough behind him was eaten by the dog. Crying loudly, he said, the fried tsampa that he finally got was eaten by the dog.

195

This parable shows that we must cherish the human body that we have obtained with great difficulty.

To truly make good use of one's own human body for liberation and Buddhahood, one should not easily waste this rare and precious human body.

These are a few rare parables that Master Potoba told about the Precious Human Rebirth.

If we can truly practice, we can achieve liberation, attain Buddhahood, be reborn in the Land of Ultimate Bliss, or obtain a precious human body once again in our next life.

You can get what you want, but if you don't cherish it and don't practice, you'll really be wasting your time and your life.

If you know the conditions for obtaining a precious human body, you will understand how difficult it is to obtain a precious human body, because the causes and conditions of this are difficult to encounter.

Specifically, it is difficult to plant the seeds of a precious human life; even if they are planted, it is difficult to protect them; even if you work hard to protect them, the good fruits of a precious human body are difficult to fully mature.

##### (1) Seeds that bring a precious human life 

The seed that results in a precious human body is the keeping of pure vows. 

It is hard to say whether the seeds of this kind of wish have been planted, and even if they are planted, whether they will germinate and grow in the future.

196

##### (2) It is difficult to protect the seeds of a precious human life

After making good vows, one has to practice the ten virtues, and then it is possible to obtain a precious human life.

Even after cultivating the Ten Virtues, one can accumulate the blessings of obtaining a human body of leisure and perfection, but because there are many factors that consume the blessings, it is not always possible to obtain a precioushuman body filled with freedoms and endowments.

For example, if you lose your temper and get angry before you die, or you hold wrong views such as not believing in cause and effect, etc., you will destroy the good deeds of many past kalpas, and the seeds of the precious human body will not be able to ripen.

Therefore, this seed is difficult to maintain.

##### (3) It is difficult to fully ripen the fruit of the precious human body 

Even if there is no accidental consumption of good fortune, no anger, no jealousy, and the ten virtues, vows, and six perfections are also cultivated.

At the end of life, compared with the blessings and rewards of life after life, if the karma is heavy, the results of bad karma will appear first, and the good results of the precious human rebirth will be delayed, and it will be difficult to fully mature.

You may even fall into the evil realms. This is the working of karma in the world, and no one can change it.

Buddhist scriptures say:

Those with extremely heavy karma in the world, near karma and habitual karma,

The strongest karma, etc., in order, mature in turn.

When the negative karma is the same as the good karma, it is difficult to say which one will come to fruition first. When there is a small difference in the karmic charge, the heaviest one will produce results first.

So we need to repent often, try our best to reduce karma, and not give it have the opportunity to mature.

Moreover, after falling into the evil realms, there is absolutely no chance to practice good dharma, and we will continue to create negative karma, making it ever more difficult to escape.

It is much more difficult to cultivate a precious human life full of freedoms after being reborn in an evil realm than to cultivate and become a Buddha with a precious human life full of freedom now.

##### 5. Cherish this Precious Human Rebirth 

Once the precious human rebirth has been obtained, most people do not realize its value and do not cherish it.

Instead, thy live their lives in confusion and ignorance.

Some people even use the human body to create a lot of negative karma, fall into the evil realms after death, and waste this rare and precious human life.

On the other hand, some people have great good fortune, they do well in their worldly affairs, they make a lot of money, and they also do a lot of good deeds.

198

However, this can only help obtain temporary benefits, obtain wealth in this world or the fruits of men and gods, and cannot solve the major events of cyclical life after life, let alone become a Buddha. 

It can also be said to be a waste of time and life.

To escape from the cycle of the six realms of rebirth, through liberation and becoming a Buddha, we must use our bodies to practise. However, most people do not understand the characteristics of their own bodies, nor do they realize the uniqueness of the human body.

We Jambudvipa people are very special and have many unparalleled characteristics.

For example, in order to liberate oneself and become a Buddha, one must cultivate virtues, concentration, and wisdom.

The five precepts contained in the vows and other virtues of the vows of separation and liberation must be founded on renunciation to truly arise.

However, beings in the three evil realms are always suffering, starving, and fearful, and beings in the heavenly realm are always enjoying themselves. It is difficult for these beings to realise renunciation. The thought of renunciation may never even cross their minds.

In the Saha world, although the people of the Northern continent have great fortune, they are relatively stupid and not suitable for ordination. Among the other three continents, only those of us in the southern Jambudvipa continent can generate renunciation and obtain the most extraordinary precepts and virtues.

In addition, the bodhicitta aim necessary for becoming a Buddha is also most powerful in our precious human body. Therefore, Nagarjuna Bodhisattva said in the Book of Disciples:

>
>If you want to become a Buddha and save sentient beings, 
>
>only human beings have this great mind power.
>
>Nagas, Asuras, Golden-winged serpents are not as good as these.
>

199

This is also the case for upholding the Tantric vows. Moreover, the most extraordinary facet of Tantric Buddhism is to become a Buddha, and it also requires a womb-born human body with the six elements (flesh, skin, blood, bone, marrow, and essence). Flesh and blood.

Therefore, in order to achieve Buddhahood and liberation, it is most suitable to use our human body to practice, with the greatest mental strength, the best conditions, and the fastest path to Buddhahood.

After understanding this, we should be able to realize that making use of the human body to practice liberation will be faster.

Therefore, after you have obtained a precious human body full of freedom and time, you cannot waste it. Ashvaghosha Bodhisattva (Ma Ming) said in the Book of Glory:

>
>Those who have obtained a human life rich in virtues 
>
>Through accumulation of merit over innumerable eons, 
>
>And who then, due to confusion in this life, 
>
>Fails to accumulate even the slightest treasury of merit 
>
>Will in future lifetimes 

>Enter the house of unbearable sorrow.
>
>Like the traders who go to a land of
jewels 
>
>And return home empty-handed,
>

It means that there is nothing more stupid in the world than a merchant who, without regard for life or death, goes to a treasure land full of treasures in the sea, and then comes home empty-handed without finding anything.

We should also think this way: just like when you arrive at the treasure island, you cannot go back empty-handed; if you get a wish-fulfilling treasure, you cannot just throw it away.

Once you have obtained such a precious human body, you must use it well and not waste it.

There was once a royal family in India. During the war, the family was destroyed and there was only one person left. Everyone took everything from their family, and only a large and heavy piece of agarwood remained.

200

In order to make a living, he took the agarwood to sell on the street. Everyone saw that this piece of agarwood was too precious to buy.

He was in a hurry. At this time, he saw someone selling charcoal next to him, and many people were buying it, so he burned the agarwood to turn it into charcoal and sold it.

Once you have obtained a precious human body, if you do not practice the Dharma diligently, it is equivalent to burning this precious human body.

If you can think of it: it would be a pity to waste your time.

With this kind of awareness, the notion that a human being full of freedoms is rare arises easily.

Being close to good people and being able to meet a worthy teacher are the outer conditions for learning and cultivating the Dharma; one is a person who is free and full of time, and has the eighteen conditions of being free.

Learning Buddhism requires many different conditions. These two are the biggest and most important. We have already satisfied these two conditions. In this life, we should diligently practice the Dharma, so as not to waste this tremendous potentiality.

201

#### Section 2 Correctly understand that the heart of the Dharma is to be close to the guru, which is the foundation of the Path.

There are the Lower, Middle, and Upper scopes.

Where to start learning Buddhism, that is to start with the path of the Lower scope, the most difficult thing to cultivate is the path of the Lower scope.

Some people start cultivation directly from the Middle scope, which is impossible to achieve. If you want to succeed, you must first cultivate the path of the Lower scope.

The Path is the Path. 

If you have the Path, you can achieve success. If you don’t follow the Path, you can only accumulate some blessings, but it is impossible to attain liberation.

The foundation of the path of the Upper scope is the path of the Middle scope, the foundation of the path of the Middle scope is Lower scope, and the basis of the Lower scope is to be close to the teacher, so being close to the teacher is the foundation of the Path.

To become a Buddha, one must cultivate these three paths.

##### 1. The goal of the path of the Three Scopes 

The goal pursued by the Lower scope is not to fall into the evil realms of rebirth.

It includes understanding the impermanence of life, the suffering of the three evil realms, taking refuge, and respecting cause and effect.

These four parts are to be cultivated by the mortals, and the result of achievement is the fruit of humans and gods.

The goal pursued by the the path of the Middle scope is to liberate oneself and obtain the fruit of Arhatship.

To attain Arhatship, one must have renunciation. On the basis of renunciation, one can then cultivate the Four Noble Truths of Suffering, Accumulation, Elimination, and the Path.

There are also two kinds of methods, one is to meditate on the Twelve Links of Dependent Origination, and the other is to cultivate morality, concentration, and wisdom. These three are the methods of the path of the Middle Scope. If you can practice any one of them, you can achieve the status of Arhat.

202

The goal pursued by the path of the Upper Scope is to become a Buddha, and the methods to be cultivated are compassion, bodhicitta, six perfections, and four sets.

After attaining the Upper level, then practicing the second stage of Tantra, the result obtained is becoming a Buddha, that is, obtaining the fruit status of a Buddha.

It is a real and thorough awakening. A great awakening!

##### 2. Common and Uncommon Paths 

The Path of the Three Scopes are divided into common and uncommon Paths.

Although the goals pursued by the three Paths are not the same, those who want to become Buddhas must first cultivate the Lower Scope path, then the Middle and finally the Upper level.

Let’s talk about common ground first.

Those who want to practice the path of the Upper Scope must do it, those who want to practice the path of the Middle Scope must do so too, and those who want to practice the path of the Lower Scope must do so as well.

Those who cultivate the three kinds of Paths must go through and cultivate the Path, which is the common Path.

What is the common Lower scope? The impermanence of life, the suffering of the three evil realms, taking refuge, and respecting cause and effect, all these must be cultivated.

However, the goal of pursuit is not to attain the fruit of human beings and gods, but to attain the fruit of Arhatship or to become a Buddha.

203

As for the common Middle scope, if the goal of cultivating is not to obtain the fruit of Arhatship, but to become a Buddha, to obtain the awareness of a Buddha, to renounce the Buddhahood, and then to cultivate disciplines such as precepts, concentration, and wisdom.

It is the common Middle scope path.

In addition to the common way, there are also other ways.

What is the uncommon Lower scope? If the person who cultivates the mortal way, the goal is only to get the fruit of man and gods, it is the uncommon path of the Lower scope.

If the goal pursued by cultivating the sage path is to obtain the status of Arhat, and only to liberate oneself from samsara, then it is an uncommon sage path.

The Path of the Upper scope is not a common way, it is the only way to attain liberation and become a Buddha, and there is no common method.

##### 3. The order of practice of Three Principle Aspects of the Path 

Some people have misunderstandings about the Three Principle Aspects of the Path.

For example, some people say: "Why do you want to practice the path of the Lower scope? The fruit of the path of the Lower scope is the fruit of man and gods. I want to be liberated, and I do not want to cultivate the path of the Lower scope."

Others say, "I want to become a Buddha. The fruit of the Middle Scope path is the fruit of Arhatship. I don't want to practice the Middle Scope path."

This is all wrong! Although to become a Buddha, one must cultivate the Middle Scope path.

However, the foundation of the Upper scope is the Middle scope, and the foundation of the Middle scope is the Lower scope. All three paths must be cultivated in sequence to become a Buddha.

204

Without the renunciation of the Middle path, the bodhicitta of the Upper path cannot arise.

Renunciation is the foundation of bodhicitta. With renunciation, one can truly appreciate the suffering of sentient beings in the six realms, and can have a very detailed understanding of the suffering of sentient beings. After experiencing the suffering of sentient beings, it is easy to generate great kindness and compassion.

Without great kindness and compassion, there is no bodhicitta.

The foundation of renunciation is the Lower scope view of the impermanence of life.

Once the concept of impermanence is realised, it is easy to develop renunciation.

The foundation of the concept of impermanence is first to realize that the precious human body is rare, that is, the human body is full of freedom; to cultivate the concept of the rare and precious human body, one must get close to the teacher, and the root of the Dharma is to be close to the teacher; after getting close to and relying on the teacher, the Dharma, concepts and methods of Buddhism will naturally be understood.

If the practice procedures are not disordered, the achievement will be very fast; if the procedures are disordered, there will be no way to achieve success.

If the path of cultivation is messy, it will be troublesome. Why is it difficult for people today to achieve success? 

It is because they do not understand the procedures, do not follow the steps, and do not care about the correct order.

They all think about cultivating Dharma, look down on the Lower scope path, think it is a petty Dharma, and 100% of such people will not succeed because the procedures are messed up.

Just like taking a plane, you can't reach your destination if the plane is flying in the wrong direction.

205

In the past, great siddhis were constantly appearing in Tibet. Why?

Because all of them practiced according to the Three Aspects of the Path.

The Three Aspects taught by Buddha Shakyamuni is the Prajna Paramita Sutra (Mahā-prajñāpāramitā Sūtra), the Three Aspects taught by Maitreya Bodhisattva is "Abhisamaya-alaṅkāra - Ornament for Clear
Realization", the Three Aspects taught by Nagarjuna are "Theory of Victory and Treasures", and the Three Aspects taught by Bodhisattva Asanga are the "Five Dharmas of Maitreya", and the three Aspects taught by the Venerable Atisha are contained in the "Lamp for the Path to Enlightenment".

These sutras, no matter from which point of view, and no matter who the author is, in the final analysis, they are all about the stages of the path to enlightenment and the three principal aspects of the path.

Beginning with Master Tsongkhapa, most of the practitioners have spent their entire lives reading Master Tsongkhapa's "The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path to Enlightenment" and "A Brief Commentary on the Steps of the Path to Enlightenment".

Some of the great siddhis of the past have recited the Bodhi path extensively or briefly, a thousand times or three thousand times.

Master Yongzeng once said:

"After I read the 'Brief Commentary on the Steps of the Path to Enlightenment' 180 times, I really understood it.

And the more you look at it, the more you understand it. The more you look at it, the more you feel that the Dharma is connected to your heart. In the end, the Dharma truly lives in your heart."

The Dharma Master Yongzeng also said that although he received all the empowerments and all the instructions of Rako Rinpoche, the ones that helped him the most were from these two books: "The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path to Enlightenment" and the "Brief Commentary on the Steps of the Path to Enlightenment".

According to the experience of the great siddhas of the Gelug School, if you practice according to the procedures and don’t practice randomly, you can achieve the rank of the lower scope in three years, the middle scope in one year, and the upper scope in one year. Among them, the most difficult one is the lower scope .

After attaining the upper level, one can become a Buddha in a total of seven years by practicing the Tantra of the second class. This is the time it takes for an ordinary person to attain the ultimate achievement through practice.

And those who are very rare in all aspects, such as the Vajra disciples who practice extremely diligently, can become a Buddha in three years and three and a half months.

This kind of excellence refers to those who have practiced the "Three Principal Aspects" in previous lives, and have achieved success, and have the foundation of the Lower scope.

There is a book called "Liberation in the Palm of the Hand" which teaches the order of the stages. By learning and cultivating the three scopes, liberation can really be mastered in one's own hands. There is such a certainty, and countless great achievers have also come this way.

Among the three aspects of the path, the lower scope is the most basic, and it is also the most difficult to learn and adhere to. Once you have achieved several concepts of the lower scope, your practice will progress very quickly.

At this time, even if someone tries to stop us from practicing the Dharma, it will not stop us.

Now, even if others encourage us to practice, we can't get progress quickly, because everyone is still in the stage of lower scope, and we haven't crossed it yet.

### Chapter 1 The Three Principal Aspects of the Path 

#### Section 1 Impermanence of Life

Life is impermanent, and you can't slack off, because life is impermanent, and it is constantly changing due to the working of karma.

We must recognize the impermanence of life, understand the impermanence of life, and often think about the impermanence of life.

After you have achieved the concept of impermanence in life, you will enter the path of the lower scope. The concept of impermanence in life has many benefits for practice.

The concept of impermanence in life gives people a sense of urgency, which is conducive to diligent practice of the Dharma.

Before realizing that life is impermanent, you may sometimes think:

"Although the Buddhadharma is precious and rare, life is still very long, and I can practice it slowly. If you don't practice the Dharma today, then you can practice it tomorrow, and you will have time to practice it when you are old."

Such an attitude is common.

In fact, it’s really hard to say whether a person can have a tomorrow.

What if he dies today if he hasn’t practiced Buddhism yet? Some people lie down at night, don't wake up the next morning, and die in their sleep.

211

After understanding the impermanence of life, you will think: Living until tomorrow is not certain.

If you don't have time to practice the Buddhadharma, you just walk away empty-handed. What if you fall into an evil realm?

You should begin to practice hard.

When one does not realize that the human body is impermanent, the state of practice can easily regress.

After practicing for several years, the disciples of Venerable Atisha reported to their respective achievements.

Some people said they had attained supernatural powers, but the Venerable said that they have achieved nothing; some said that they have recited the six-syllable mantra 100 million times, but the Venerable still said that they have achieved nothing; some said that the concept of impermanence in life has arisen, and the Venerable immediately said happily after hearing this: "You're on the Path, it's good."

Even if you recite the holy name of Amitabha Buddha 100 million times, there is no guarantee that you will not fall back.

However, if you realize the impermanence of life and develop the concept of impermanence in life, you will not retreat, and your practice will be more diligent.

Obtaining the concept of impermanence in life is beneficial to eliminate greed, hatred, and delusion, and reduce karma.

Once you have the concept of impermanence in life, you will realize that your body is like a hotel, and your soul is only temporarily living in this hotel.

212


So, if the hotel is damged in some places, you don't care, and the ego doesn't grow.

If you think about it further, because life is impermanent, and the span of your life in this world is not certain, in this way, your attachment to outsiders, events, and things will be weakened a lot.

If you are less attached, there will be no more troubles, no more bad karma, and bad karma will not be able to take root.

Not only is it beneficial to practice in this way, but it is also easier to obtain happiness in the world.

##### 1. How to think about the impermanence of life 

So, how to think about the impermanence of life? First of all, we must understand the three roots, nine causes, and three conditions for the impermanence of life.

The three roots of impermanence in life are: people are bound to die; not only will they die but the time of death is unknown; when they die, nothing can help them except the Dharma.

##### (1) Man is bound to die 

The first root of impermanence is that man is bound to die.

Man must die for three reasons, one condition.

The three reasons are: death is bound to come, and nothing can change it; life expectancy is decreasing all the time and there is no way to extend it.

213

One condition is: the Dharma must be practiced.

Death must come, and nothing can change the four causes of why death must come.

##### (1) No matter where you born, death is inevitable. People must die.

There are four continents where people were born: Jambudvipa, Eastern Holy Isle, West Land, and the Northern continent.

Among them, the people in the Norther Continent will live a little longer and can live to be a thousand years old, and there are also people on the other eight small continents.

People are bound to die in whatever continent they are born in, and death cannot be avoided no matter they are born.

Therefore, it is said in Collection of Sayings:

>
>There is no place where death can be avoided,
>
>There is nowhere in the sky, nowhere in the sea, and nowhere in the forest.
>

If you are born in the sea, you will surely die, if you are born in the sky, you will surely die. There is no way to avoid death no matter where you are born, and there is no place where you can escape death.

##### (2) There is no era where death can be avoided. Being born in any age will lead to death.

Do not kill, do not steal, do not commit adultery, do not tell lies, these are called the four fundamental precepts.

The era when the four fundamental precepts are violated is called the age of degeneration.

Since ancient times, the Age of Degeneration has lasted for a long, long time. With the growth of human greed, hatred, and delusion, some people have become greedy for food and drink, and there is a phenomenon of stealing. When they violate the precept of "not stealing", human beings enter The three-point era has entered; human beings have continued to develop, and adultery has appeared again, breaking the precept of "not committing adultery", and entering the era of two-pointing; then there is the phenomenon of murder, and the precept of "not killing living beings" has been violated.

Now, the four fundamental precepts have all been broken, which is called the era of conflict in Buddhism.

Life will end in the Age of Degeneration, but lifespan will be a little longer.

If you are born in a three-point era or a two-point era, you will die.

Now is the era of conflict, and in the era of conflict, not only will people die, but death will come very quickly.

We can all see that now, it is very rare for a person to live to be 80 years old. Most people do not live to be 80 years old, they die at the age of 60 or 70, and many people die at the age of 30 or 40.

While everyone would like to live to be eighty years old, this idea really doesn't necessarily come true.

##### (3) No life can avoid death. All living beings will die.

People will die, and animals will die; ordinary people will die, and powerful people will die; people in the Saha world will die, and so will gods and demi-gods.

All life will die, this is an inviolable law of nature.

##### (4) There is no way to immortality except liberation, and there is no way to make a person immortal.

Under normal circumstances, we cannot escape death by reciting mantras and sutras.

However, if you rely on the practice of the Three Aspects, you can truly be liberated, and you can break through the obstacles of birth, aging, sickness and death, but you still have to give up your current physical body.

Therefore, you cannot be attached to your own flesh.

When we practice to the extent that we can liberate ourselves, in the physical body, the soul will form a light body of consciousness the size of a seven or eight-year-old child, complete with all five faculties and very solemn.

After attaining the status of an arhat, if the light body of consciousness leaves the body, the arhat will pass away.

The Buddhas and Bodhisattvas of Mahayana are different from this. The light bodies of consciousness of Bodhisattvas of the eighth bhumi and above can come and go freely in the body.

If you don't want to give up your body, you can live for a long time.

For example, some yogis who practice Mahavira.

A yogi named Zaya Wanzhida, lived to be a thousand years old; another named Jebejum lived to be five hundred years old.

Nagarjuna Bodhisattva lived for 600 years and was free to come and go. After 600 years, when he encountered another karma and decided to give up his physical body, he appeared and passed away.

216

The Buddhist scriptures say:

The Omniscient Buddha and the Enlightened Buddha, 

and the sage-hearers of the disciples of the Buddha,

also cast aside the physical body, 

not to mention other mortals,

Now, let's think about it, the Buddha, who has obtained the immortal vajra body, will also abandon the physical body according to the karma, and show the appearance of Nirvana. There were so many great siddhis in India and Tibet who achieved freedom from birth and death, including Nagarjuna, Venerable Atisha, and Master Tsongkhapa, who have also passed away, and only their teachings remain. This is especially true for all of us. We will all die within a hundred years, without exception.

When death comes, no force can prevent it. 

In the past, the city of Kapilavastu, where the Buddha was located, was invaded by the King of Glass. The Buddha knew that this was the result of the common karma of the Sakyamuni family in the past.

The Buddha dissuaded him three times with great compassion, and the King of Glass went back and forth, but the third time he was unable to stop him.

When the Liuli King attacked the city, Maudgalyāyana wanted to use his miraculous power to bring the Liuli King's army outside the Tiewei Mountain, but the Buddha said it was useless.

So, Maudgalyāyana hid some young men and women of the Shakya tribe in the Buddha's bowl. However, after the massacre, when the Shakya people died, this group of people also died.

It shows that Buddha power cannot stop karma.

217

Therefore, it is said in the "Abandoned Rock Mountain Sutra": 

"The incomparable wisdom and supernatural powers of the Buddhas are not as powerful as the power of death,

and the power of all Buddhas and Bodhisattvas combined is powerless against the laws of rebirth and of death."

Then, can you save yourself by obtaining supernatural powers? In the Anthology of Impermanence, it says:

>
>An immortal possessing the five powers, 
>
>although he can travel thousands of miles in the air,
>
>Somewhere to live that is unharmed by death— 
>
>Such a place does not exist. 
>
>It does not exist in space, it does not exist in the sea, 
>
>Nor if you stay in the midst of mountains.
>

That is to say, those immortals who have supernatural powers and obtain the five supernatural powers, no matter how they change, how fast they run with supernatural powers, they will not be able to run away from karma, and they will not be able to run away from death.

Power and wealth are useless.

When the wheel-turning king's blessings are exhausted, he will also fall into the evil realm. The power and wealth of these worldly gods have no ability to stop death, let alone us ordinary people.

There is no way for doctors to cure impermanence, and there is no panacea for impermanence. This is known and understood by everyone.

In a word, there is no way to keep a person from dying.

Our life expectancy is decreasing all the time, without any increase. Our lifespan is decreasing every day, even breathing is decreasing, life is decreasing every moment.

In the Bodhisattva-caryāvatāra, it says:

>
>Day and night without pause, 
>
>this longevity is constantly diminished,
>
>There is nothing left to add, 
>
>how can I not die?
>

From the moment we emerge from the womb, our lives are diminished, every minute and second that passes.

If you can live to eighty years old, your life expectancy will be reduced by one year at the age of one year, and you will only be seventy-nine years old.

Life is decreasing all the time, there is no possibility of increasing it, and in the end we all must die.

There is not much time in one's lifetime to practice the Dharma. If a person can live to be 80 years old, before the age of 20, he must learn and grow according to the customs of the world, and he will not think of practicing Buddhism. There are only sixty years left.
In sixty years, the time spent sleeping and eating three meals a day will never be less than twelve hours, so if you remove half of the time for eating and sleeping, there will be no time for thirty years.

In the remaining thirty years, work will take up fifteen years.

In the remaining fifteen years, if you don’t work hard, you have more fun, and you waste your time on pleasure. It’s hard to say whether you have five years of real practice, but five years is already very good.

Therefore, some people say that they have studied Buddhism for 20 years, but have they actually studied for 20 years? Maybe it was only 20 years ago that they started learning, and they spent ten years eating and sleeping, at least seven or eight years working, and maybe only one or two years of cultivation.

He also said that after 20 years of cultivation, he has not achieved anything, so how could he have achieved success.

The Buddhist scriptures say:

Cruel and merciless death, before it comes,

Prepare all the good resources, don't regret it later,


The first decision: you must study the Dharma

By thinking about the first root of impermanence in life: people must die, and the three reasons why people must die, we have to make a choice: we must practice the Dharma.

Everyone must think very clearly: in our life, we will surely die no matter where we are born; we will surely die at any age; in this life, no matter what our fate is, we will surely die; our lifespan will decrease every day, no extension.

If you don't practice the Dharma very much in your lifetime, you can't be sure where you will go in future rebirths. It's really scary!

Therefore, you must practice the Dharma, you must practice the Dharma!

220

##### (2) Not only will you die but the time of death is uncertain. 

The second root of impermanence in life is that you will not only die but the time of death is uncertain.

The three reasons for the uncertainty of the time of death are: life is uncertain; there are many causes of death; and the body is extremely fragile.

The life expectancy of people in Jambudvipa is indeterminate, and it is said in the "Kushi Lun": The north is a thousand years old, and the remaining two and a half are reduced.
That is to say, in the four continents, the life expectancy of people on the other three continents is fixed.

People in the North can live to a thousand years, and there is a regular period; the other two continents have a "half and half reduction" in their lifespan. People in the Western Lands can live 500 years; people in the Eastern Isle can live for 250 years. These are fixed lifespans.

Only the people in Jambudvipa are different, "the last ten years are immeasurable", the initial lifespan is immeasurable years, and at the end of the Five Turbid Ages, ten years old is the longest lifespan, and the lifespan is very, very short.

Not only is the lifespan very short, the time of death is unknown.

Some people die as soon as they are born, some die when they are children, or die in middle age or old age, and the time of death is uncertain.

221

There are many causes of death, so there is no fixed time of death.
Causes of death are divided into internal and external obstacles.

In the past, Tibetan classics recorded that there were various troubles caused by internal obstacles that lead to death, and there were 424 cases of illness.

However, people in the Dharma-ending period now have thousands of diseases, and many people have died because of them. These diseases are all causes of death.

External obstacles are demonic obstacles, and 84,000 demonic obstacles are also the cause of death. Many people have died because of demonic obstacles.

In addition, natural disasters of earth, water, fire and wind are also among the causes of death. Many people have died in earthquakes, floods, fires, and wind disasters.

There are many, many causes of death, but very few causes of life, and causes of life sometimes become causes of death.

For example, the house was originally the cause of life, to protect our lives from wind and rain, but it can also become the cause of death. During an earthquake, the collapse of the house will crush people to death.

Diet is also the cause of life, and it can also become the cause of death. Many people get sick due to improper diet, or die from poisoning.

Therefore, Nagarjuna Bodhisattva said in the "Precious Garland":

>
>There are many ties to death, 
>
>but only a few ties to living.
>
>Such things also become death, 
>
>so one should always practice the Dharma.
>

...

Resting in death is like a candle in the wind.

It means that our life is like an oil lamp in a gust of wind. There are many deaths around us, but we are small and powerless, and may be extinguished at any time.

The body of a very fragile person is very weak, so there is no regularity in death.
Although there are many causes of death and very few causes of life, if our bodies were indestructible, no matter how many causes of death, we would not be afraid of them.

However, in reality, our physical body is very fragile.

For example, many people's bodies have fragile parts, which are the lifeblood, and a touch is fatal.

Some people die after being slapped in the face. Everyone's lifeblood is different, and they don't know where they are.

Examples of people being easily hurt, everyone knows of many stories.

There are several metaphors for the fragility of life in Buddhist scriptures: life is like an oil lamp in the wind, which is easily extinguished when lit in a strong wind; it is also like a bubble foaming on water, which is extinguished at once.

Nagarjuna Bodhisattva also said in the Book of Relatives and Friends:

>
>Life is more harmful than impermanent.
>
>Bubbles on the water burst easily.
>
>There is life and death between one breath and the next, 
>
>and it is a miracle to wake up after sleeping.
>

It means that the impermanence of life is easier than the bursting of water bubbles, and there is life and death between breaths.

Because when a person enters a deep sleep, the coarse breathing stops, and only the very fine air is flowing. The next morning, if this fine flow of air is not broken, the person can wake up again, which is actually a very rare thing.

If you think about these three reasons, you will understand: we people in Jambudvipa have many causes of death, few causes of birth, and the moment of death is uncertain.

Life is fragile, and even waking up after falling asleep is a miracle, and it’s true, but we don’t usually realize it.

So the scripture says:

>
>Tomorrow or afuture rebirth, I don't know which will come first,
>
>Abandoning tomorrow's affairs should be for future rebirths.
>

Tomorrow or the afterlife, which comes first is unknown, and it is difficult to say where the afterlife will take us.

Sometimes people hear that someone has died, but no one expected that person to die.

Everyone wants to live a long life, to live to ninety or one hundred years old, but they don't think about it.

224

The second decision: follow the Dharma immediately

By thinking about the second root of impermanence in life: people not only die but time of death is uncertain, and the three reasons for uncertainty of death, we have to make a decision: immediately practice the Dharma.

Gongtang Rinpoche said in the "Anthology of Impermanence":

Before the dawn of tomorrow's practice of the Dharma, 

today's death is approaching,

Don't deceive yourself now and follow the Dharma from now on.

Not only do people die, the time of death is uncertain.

Whether we will die today or tomorrow, no one can be sure. Before death comes, we must decide to practice the Dharma today. This is very important!

In the "Guide to Enlightenment", it is said that the most important of the three fundamentals is to think about the time of death being uncertain. Thinking about the uncertainty of the time of death can really change our attitude and encourage us to diligently practice the Dharma.

If you procrastinate and do not practice the Dharma, you will regret it very much before you die.

In addition, if you procrastinate in the practice of the Dharma today and tomorrow, it will gradually turn into Dharma oil, and it will be even more difficult to control your mind.

There are several reasons for it to become oilseed.

Or, after hearing it, you don’t practice it, and you get tired of listening to it and you become oily seeds of the Dharma. It doesn't matter; or because of laziness, lack of effort, etc.

Therefore, while learning you must pay equal attention to listening, thinking, and cultivation.

The Kadampa Patriarch said:

>
>The Dharma can pacify sinners, 
>
>but it is difficult to pacify oilseeds.
>
>Oil can tan rough skins, 
>
>but it is difficult to tan oily skins.
>

If you become Dharma oil seed because of other Dharma, you can also be taught by studying the Three Ways and contemplating the impermanence of life.

But if you also become slick with the steps, there is no cure, so be careful!

##### (3) At the time of death, nothing can help except the Buddhadharma.

The third fundamental also includes three reasons: when you die, money can't help; relatives and friends can't help; your body can't help.

When you die, money can't help, no matter how much money you have it is useless, it can't help you, and it can't save you.
There are such examples around everyone. Some rich people died, left behind hundreds of millions of assets, and left on their own.

So much money can't be exchanged for immortality in the face of death.

So, money can't help us when we die.

The third Kungtang Rinpoche also said:

>
>Although there is gold and silver piled up in the valley,
>
>when you die, you can't take a penny with you.
>

When we die, our relatives and friends can't help us. How many relatives and friends can't save us.

The Fourth Panchen Lama said in "Dangers and Difficulties in Liberation":

>
>Those who save money and silk are all abandoned, 
>
>and all the loving family members leave forever.
>

Sometimes, relatives and friends will be too attached to the person who is about to die. For example, at the end of life, if relatives and friends are crying non-stop, it will make the person who is about to die feel uneasy and worry. There may also be thoughts of attachment to relatives, friends, and children, and even if you want to leave, you can’t leave.

That's why it says in the Treatise on Entering the Bodhisattva's Way:

Come alone in life, go alone in death,

No one to share the pain, 

what's the use of hindering relatives and friends.

When you die, your body can't help. We already know that wealth can't help when you're dying. You can't buy medicine for immortality, and money can't redeem your life. Friends and family can't help, let alone other people.
So, can you rely on your own body?

Everyone protects their own body every day like a wish-fulfilling treasure. We hope that this body will always be young and beautiful and accompany us.

But, in fact, the body is like a hotel, the essence is like a tourist, and a tourist cannot stay in a hotel all the time.

When fate runs out, the soul needs to change to a body, just like a tourist needs to change to another hotel when it’s time, but he can’t keep it if he wants to stay.

So, when you die, your body can't help either.

Decision 3: Only follow the Dharma

By thinking about the third root of impermanence in life: when a person dies, property can’t help, relatives and friends can’t help, and even our own body can’t help, so we shouldn’t be attached to anything in the world.

The "Impermanence" says:

>
>In the past and in the future, 
>
>we must give up this body and leave,
>
>The wise realize that everything is destroyed, 
>
>and in the Dharma one must do the Dharma.
>

Now, we understand what can help us before we die, the Dharma that we have learned and practiced, and the "Om Mani Padme Hum" that we have recited.

228

Therefore, we decide: in the face of approaching death, we must set everything else aside and only follow the Dharma.

##### 2. Appearances and Differences at the End of Life 

Since it is said that a person will surely die, then what happens when a person dies? What is the difference between those who study Buddhism and those who do not study Buddhism when they face death?

This is divided into two parts.

##### (1) Appearance of Dying 

To put it simply, when a person is dying, the energies of the four elements of earth, water, fire, and wind will all be received into the central channel, the soul will be in the centre, and then the energy of qi in the whole person will be merged into the soul. The soul will enter emptiness.

Those who practiced at a high level will understand emptiness at this time, and will enter into meditation on emptiness, which is equivalent to liberation.

Those who practice well, some have been in meditation for more than 20 days, and before Tibet there were three months of meditation.

After entering meditation, from the outside, the person is meditating, the breath outside the body is completely cut off, the body temperature also cools, and the heart is warmer; the complexion is much better than before death, the wrinkles have disappeared, and the mouth before death is pale. At this time, it will become red, the face is also red, and the body will emit a sandalwood fragrance.

229

Such people have a relatively high level in cultivation, and for them, death is neither painful nor scary.

People with relatively good levels of practice can see Amitabha Buddha, Buddhas and Bodhisattvas before they die, and can be reborn in the Pure Land directly without going through the bardo body.

A person with an average level of practice will enter the bardo body after death. When he hears a terrifying sound or sees a terrifying sight, he will immediately think of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas to rescue him due to the habitual force of his practice during his lifetime. Then, with the power of his vows during his lifetime, he is led by Buddhas and Bodhisattvas to be reborn in the Pure Land.

For ordinary people who have poor practice or have not studied Buddhism, death is the heaviest and most painful suffering, because at this time there is no certainty or support.

However, if you can think of the Three Jewels of the Guru at this time, you will not be afraid and will not fall into the evil realms.

##### (2) The difference between those who study Buddhism and do not study Buddhism at the end of life 

Although people are bound to die, the time of death is different.

Comparing those who study Buddhism and those who do not study Buddhism, at the time of death, the difference is like night and day, and the difference is very large.

230

People who have no concept of Buddhism, because they do not understand the six realms of rebirth, feel that only their own life is the most precious, and will feel very desperate when facing the life that is about to be lost.

And because there is no strength to rely on, they don't know what to do, and they get very scared.

Those who study Buddhism have realized that after the "soul" leaves the body, it will enter the cycle of rebirth. In addition to rebirth as a human, it can also be liberated and reborn in the Pure Land, and liberation from samsara is better than having a human rebirth.

Because there are teachers and Buddhas and Bodhisattvas as backers, you will still think: I have studied Buddhism in this life, after death Amitabha will come to pick me up, and Dakinis will come to save me.

Even if my karmic obstacles are not eliminated, and I may suffer during death, during the bardo period, or in the next life, but there will be Buddhas and Bodhisattvas who will protect me.

Thinking about my life, I have recited many scriptures and mantras, and practiced many methods. I will not fall into the evil realms, I will not be afraid in my heart, and I will leave this world peacefully.

There is no ordinary person who is not afraid of death, unless it is a person with demonic, ghostly, or non-human obstacles who is driven by these external forces and is not afraid of death.

Normal people will definitely be afraid of death, and people who have not studied Buddhism well will be even more afraid of death.

Those who earnestly study Buddhism will not be afraid. Those who study Buddhism well will have already eliminated all major karmic debts before death.

231

At the time of death, Amitabha Buddha or other Buddhas and Bodhisattvas will appear, or the Pure Lands of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas will appear, such as the Land of Ultimate Bliss, the Pure Land of Dakinis, and so on.

When these people were dying, their state was even better than usual. Some even sang happily and left, while others recited "Om Mani Padme Hum" and passed away.

In Tibetan areas, there are many elderly people who passed away in meditation while visualising Dakinis.

Their complexion looks much better than before death, with a smile on their face, and they are not afraid at all! Therefore, when a person who is a good Buddhist learner is about to die, he has no sense of fear.

A person who has attained a higher level of Buddhist achievement will be greeted by Buddhas and Bodhisattvas when he dies. Dakins, Dakinis, warrior gods and godesses will come to meet him. The sound of drums and bells will sound in the sky, or other auspicious signs will appear.

For example, if you die in winter, the weather may get warmer, the plants will bloom, etc.

There is a great siddha in Tibet called Kalu Phuntsok, who passed away in the eleventh month of the lunar calendar, which is the coldest season in Tibet.

When he passed away, the dakini Buddha Tara came to greet him on his way to the Dakini Pure Land. Many people heard the sound of bells and drums in the sky, and the climate became as warm as summer.

232

#### 3. How to achieve the view of impermanence in life** 

Now, only by accumulating merit, making good vows, and practicing the ten virtues, we have obtained a precious human body with eight freedoms and ten endowments.

Moreover, we have also met a virtuous master, and we have the circumstances conducive to studying Buddhism.

At the same time, we also recognize the impermanence of life and recognize that death could come at any time.

Think about the death that happens around you.

For example, friends we met last year and passed away this year. This is the impermanence of life.

News that someone has died of illness or accident is very common.

Death can also happen to us at any time. What if we suddenly die one day, but our practice is not enough, what should we do if we fall into the evil realms?

All leaving unexpectedly!

So, a decision should be made and the Dharma must be practised immediately!

Think again, some people are very rich, but when death comes, they get a terminal illness, spend a lot of money to buy the best medicine, but they can't save their lives, and they can't take the rest of their money with them. They can only leave on their own.

Money, relatives, and friends are useless when death comes, only the Buddha's Dharma is useful and is the only way out.

Therefore, for the sake of future rebirths, you should decide that only the practice of Buddha's Dharma is worhtwhile.

233

You have to think like this often.

You can also think about the situations where your relatives and friends have died. If you have the opportunity, you should also look around. If someone dies, think about how they died, and think about what happened before and after death. Remind yourself that life is impermanent.

After realizing the concept of impermanence in life, the practice will never regress, and a courageous and diligent mind will arise, and the practice will gradually enter a better phase.

I often think: I don’t know if I can live until tomorrow, so I must seize today and practice the Dharma; people and things in the world can not help at the time of my death and future rebirth, so I should not be attached, I should use my time well. Just study the Dharma.

Master Tsongkhapa's eldest disciple, Master Gyaltsab Je, was still very hard-working in his old age. If someone wanted to see him, they would  ask the attendant to inform him. The attendant would say to Gyaltsab Je: "Master, someone wants very much to see you."

Gyaltsab Je declined and said, "Look at my hair turning white, I'm getting old, and you want me to see these people. Why waste my time?"

But looking at ourselves, we are old, our hair is gray, and we are moving towards death step by step without realizing it.

There is still hope in our heart, and we want to live to the age of eighty or ninety. This is because we have not realised the truth of impermanence.

If you have realised the concept of impermanence of life, then you can say that you have truly entered the Path of the Dharma.

After entering the path, the idea of ​​liberation naturally arises from the depths of the heart.

At the beginning, many great achievers mainly meditated on the concept of impermanence in life. Some people asked Venerable Atisha for the Dharma. The Venerable said: Learn to take refuge in the Three Jewels, meditate on the certainty of death, and realise the impermanence of life.

234

Among the disciples of Master Bodova, there were more than 3,000 people who realised the concept of impermanence in life.

One of the disciples was retreating in a cave. There was a tree with thorns at the entrance of the cave. He was scratched whenevr when he went out of the cave, and he was scratched again when he went back into the cave. He thought: Tomorrow  I will cut down this tree.

Then he thought again: I don't know if I can live until tomorrow, where will I have time to cut down trees.

In this way, until he finally realised the concept of the impermanence of life, he lived in that cave from his twenties until he was eighty-nine years old, when he passed away.

The third Kungtang Rinpoche opened his eyes every morning and thought of the impermanence of life: Ah! I am not dead today, I am still breathing, this is the power of the Three Jewels.

We must liberate ourselves and become a Buddha! It's hard to say whether you can live until tomorrow, so be sure to practice diligently today!

We slowly think about the reasons for the impermanence of life one by one. We should think about it every day, and think about it all the time. This will greatly help our practice.

When you wake up in the morning, just think about the impermanence of life, and great greed and problems will naturally diminish.

Then continue to think: life is impermanent, and liberation is the only reliable way out.

So, we vow to be liberated, recite scriptures for liberation, and practice in order to become a Buddha.

235

When we don’t realize that life is impermanent, even chanting scriptures for the benefit of the world, in order to obtain the rewards of gods and demi-gods. it will be of no use.

236

#### Section 2: The Three Evil Realms of Suffering 

We have already understood that life is impermanent, but have you ever considered, if you really die, where will the next rebirth be?

Can you be reborn in a pure land? Will you be reborn in a good realm or to fall into a bad realm?

Always think about this yourself.

##### 1. Causes of falling into the Three Evil Realms 

Today's sentient beings have relatively heavy afflictions and often do evil things.

After death, most of them, 99% of them, will fall into the evil realms.

Among the ten evil deeds, the big ones will go to hell, the moderate ones will go to the realm of hungry ghosts, and the small ones will go to the realm of animals.

The ten evil deeds, large and small, all result in going to the three evil realms.

What is great evil? Great evil karma refers to the karma caused by great greed, hatred, and delusion, such as murder.

The karma that is most often created is also a big bad karma when accumulated, such as often stealing valuables.

Now, let's think about it, have we done anything really evil?

Among the great ten evil deeds, such as killing, have you ever had an abortion?

237

Have you ever killed someone? If you have, there is a reason for going to hell right there.

In other killing deeds, have you killed small animals for a long time and in large numbers?

If you have, there is a reason for going to hell.

Have you ever killed a wild animal or a large animal among the moderate killings? If you have, it is medium killing, and one will fall into the realm of hungry ghosts.

Small killings are relatively light in terms of negative karma. Killing one or two animals, or killing small animals, is the cause of falling into the animal realm.

Why does the size of the animal killed make a difference in the severity of karma? Because in killing a small animal you can kill it all at once, without causing too much painf, such as killing an ant.

But if you kill a sheep, the pain will be great when the sheep dies, so the karmic accumulation will be heavy.

Think again and again about the possibility of falling into other evil realms.

Think about how likely you are to fall into the realm of hungry ghosts.

Stealing will carry you into the realm of hungry ghosts, and miserliness will also carry you into the realm of hungry ghosts.

After falling into the realm of hungry ghosts, when finally reborn as a human being, you will also be a poor person.

Wonder if you've ever stolen something? 

Have you ever rejected someone because you were stingy when they needed help?

Think again, do you often tell lies?

Do you often speak harshly to  people? Are you often jealous of others? If this happens all the time, it will add up to big karma, and this negative karma will drag us into the three evil realms.

If you think about it like this, you will understand that in fact, we create a lot of bad karma, so it shouldn’t be too far from the three evil realms, and the possibility of falling into the evil realms in the next life is very great. Unless you repent, you will surely fall into the evil path.

238

#### 2. Three Evil Realms 

Suffering and bad karma will pull us into the lower realms. In order not to fall into the lower realms, we must diligently practice the righteous Dharma.

At the same time, it is necessary to understand the suffering of the three lower realms. If you can visualise the suffering of the lower realms, you can develop a strong dread of the lower realms, which will be of great help to your practice.

##### (1) Suffering in the hell realm 

"On Entering the Bodhisattva's Way" says:

>
>The karma created in an instant, 
>
>will cause you to spend a thousand years in hell.
>
>When bad karma cannot be eliminated,
>
>rebirth will not cease.
>

---

If even by the evil of one instant

An aeon may be spent in the deepest hell

Then because of the evil I have gathered since beginingless time,

What need to mention my not going to a happy realm.

---

The karma created in an instant will lead to the retribution of going to hell. After going to hell, you will spend hundreds of kalpas in hell until the karmic retribution is exhausted.

For example, the karma created in a moment of being angry with the teacher will cause you to go to hell.

Think about the karma we have created in this life, and then think about the karma accumulated over countless lifetimes, and you will understand that if we do not practice, we will definitely go to hell.

239

Being born in this world is just because the accumulated merit is a little bigger, and and the results of this are manifested first.

So, what is the pain of going to hell?

There are four types of hell: 

Hot Hell, Neighbouring Hells, Cold Hells, and Ephemeral Hells.

These four kinds of hells can be further subdivided, with a total of eighteen levels of hells.

In Bodhgaya, India, 32,000 yojanas (1 yojana is about 13 kilometers) below the Vajra Seat, where the Buddha became enlightened, is the Reviving Hell of the hot hells, and every 4,000 yojanas further down, there are other hot hells .

There are four ways of reproduction for all living beings: fetus, egg, dampness, and transformation.

Human beings belong to womb birth, hell beings belong to transformation birth.

Hot Hell 

Hot Hell is like a huge cauldron made of an iron plate. It burns red. All beings are born on this iron plate. Their bodies are huge and soft, like lotus petals.

The hot hell is very, very hot. The fire in hell is tens of thousands of times hotter than the fire in our world. If the hell fire is brought to the Saha world, it can burn Mount Sumeru in a few minutes.

It is recorded in the Buddhist scriptures that Muqianlian once used supernatural powers to bring ashes from hot hell back to the human world and put them on the seaside, and the local people could not stand the heat.

240

The hot hell is so hot, but the skin of all beings in hell is as delicate as a baby's skin, very, very sensitive.

When we touch a little fire, it will hurt. The skin of the hell beings is very, very painful when they come into contact with the hell fire. However, their bodies are as big as mountains, and there is nowhere to hide if they want to. No escape; even if you want to die, you can't die, because after death, you will be reborn instantly and continue to suffer.

You only continue to suffer until the negative karma is eliminated, and then you will be reborn elsewhere.

The hot hells are divided into eight hells: Reviving Hell, Black Line Hell, Rounding Up and Crushing Hell, Howling Hell, Great Howling Hell, Heating Hell, Intense Heating Hell, and Hell of Ultimate Torment (Avici).

The lifespan of beings in hell is very, very long. Among the eight hot hells, the one with the shortest lifespan is the Reviving Hell.

According to the Buddhist scriptures, 50 years in the human world is one day for the four heavenly kings, and such thirty days are counted as one month, and twelve months are counted as one year; the lifespan of the four heavenly kings is five hundred years, Then, these five hundred years are counted as one day and night, thirty one days and nights are counted as one month, and twelve months are counted as one year. Five hundred of these years are the lifespan of the Reviving Hell beings.

Converted according to the time unit of the human world, a total of 1620 billion years.

That is, you will be tortured in a hot hell for so long before moving to another hell.

241

Moreover, the Reviving Hell has the shortest lifespan among the hot hells, that is, the hell where one suffers for the shortest period of pain. How long the pain will last!

##### (1) Reviving Hell 

The resentment of the living beings in the Reviving Hell is very large from birth. The living beings here are just born, and a lot of knives and spears will naturally fall from the air, and then the living beings in the hell will kill each other with these weapons.

Even if all limbs are cut off, they will not faint; only if their head is cut off, they will faint for a short time, but they will not die.

Then, a sound will arise in the air, called the sound of Revival. With this sound, all beings in hell wake up, their bodies are also revived, and they kill each other again.

That's why it's called Reviving Hell.

The Book of Friends says:

During this time, three hundred spears were used to pierce the suffering caused by piercing extremely violently.

This is a slight suffering in hell, which is not a metaphor for incapacity and a small amount.

That is to say, if in the human world, if there are 300 people holding spears every day and piercing our bodies continuously for years and months, this kind of pain must be extremely unbearable, but compared with the pain in Reviving Hell, it is only a slight discomfort.

242

Moreover, the Reviving Hell is also the hell with the least suffering among all the hot hells, and sentient beings will only be temporarily released from the pain when they faint.

One can imagine how terrifying the suffering of beings in this hell is.

##### (2) Black Line Hell 

In the Black Line Hell, there are guards such as Ava Bull Head and Yaxia Pig Head. The appearance of the guards follows the karma of all sentient beings.

If sentient beings in hell often kill fish during their lifetime, what they see is the head of a fish; if they often kill sheep, what they see is the head of a sheep, and their body has the appearance of a human body.

These jailers use black thread to draw a lot of lines on the bodies of sentient beings, and then use saws and axes to cut the bodies of sentient beings into pieces according to the lines drawn.

The pieces of meat that are cut into pieces and the blood that flowed out were all painful.

But even so, he will not die or faint.

We humans will not be like this, the blood that has been shed, the flesh and blood that has been broken, we will not feel it.

Because all beings in hell are reborn, according to their own karma, this is the black line hell.

The sentient beings in the hell below the Black Line Hell, no matter what kind of torture they suffer, they will not faint or die, they can only endure the pain alive.

243

##### (3) Rounding Up and Crushing Hell

If you kill too many living beings, you will be reborn in the Rounding Up and Crushing Hell.

For example, a person who often kills sheep, when he is reborn into hell, will be hit by a lot of huge rocks and iron balls in the shape of a goat like a mountain. After being crushed, the internal organs are squeezed out from the mouth and anus. It is very painful. This is the Rounding Up and Crushing Hell.

If you were a person who often killed and caught fish during his lifetime, after he fell into the Hell, it would be the iron stone in the shape of the fish that would hit him.

##### (4) Howling hell 

Howling hell is full of big, red-hot iron plates, and all beings in hell are forced to run and hide everywhere.

When escaping, you will see a square iron house, and run into the house. As soon as you enter, the iron door will automatically close, and the whole iron house will burn and become even hotter. At this time, there is nowhere to run even if you could. You can only howl in pain, this is Howling Hell.

##### (5) Great Howling Hell 244

The difference between the Howling Hell and the Great Howling Hell is that there are two florrs in the iron houses. After beings escaped into an iron house, they find that there is another floor. Once this layer runs in, the doors of the two layers are all closed, and there is self-karma inside. The existing iron dogs and iron birds come to bite and peck at the eyes, and at the same time, the inside is even hotter, and they are also scorched like fire.

Even if you escape the first floor, you cannot escape the second floor.

The heart is more painful, howling louder, this is howling hell.

The reasons for being born in this hell are: any of the ten unwholesome deeds, and drinking alcohol without restraint. 

The sutra says:

The drinker is born in the place of howling, 

the drinker is born in the vicinity.

That is to say, not only those who drink alcohol frequently will be reborn in the howling hell, but those who often pour and persuade others to drink will also be reborn in the Neighbouring Hells.

##### (6) Fiery Hell 

In the fiery hell, there is a huge iron pot. There is red molten iron in the iron pot, which is boiling all the time. All beings are thrown into the iron pot to cook.

Sometimes a red-hot iron poker is inserted from the bottom to the top of the head, burning all over the body, this is the fiery hell.

##### (7) Blazing Hell 

245

All beings are impaled on a three-pronged iron fork from the middle of the body to the top of the head, and two large iron forks on both sides are pierced from the shoulders, just like roast sheep and pigs, and they are grilled on hellfire.

This are the hot hells.

##### (8) Hell of Ultimate Torment  

Sentient beings in the Hell of Ultimate Torment are burnt red by fire, and they can't tell which is the fire and which are the sentient beings. Only by crying can they tell the difference. This is the Hell of Ultimate Torment, also known as Avici Hell.

All the sufferings of the above seven hells added together, none of them is as great as the suffering of the Hell of Ultimate Torment.

Ultimate means continuous and uninterrupted suffering; or the evil karma of the five inexpiable sins will go to the Ultimate Hell; or life is boundless, that is, between kalpas and kalpas, the lifespan suffers uninterrupted suffering.

If you break the precepts, you will go to hell.

A tantric monk must take the monk's precepts, as well as the bodhisattva vows and the tantric vows, which add up to more than 500 precepts.

To receive various tantric empowerments, one must also uphold more than one hundred precepts.

If you can keep the precepts cleanly, the reward will be very great; but if you break the precepts, the punishment will be very heavy.

Therefore, we must be clear about how many precepts we have taken and upheld, and we cannot break the vows.

When you don’t know if you have broken your precepts, you should think like this: You are fine now, and you can still repent. If you really don’t survive today, and you go to hell without time to repent, that would be terrifying!

The karma of sentient beings is incredible! Some sentient beings with heavy karma, after eliminating the karma of Avici Hell, will enter the Great Fire Hell, and then enter the Fire Hell.

There are also sentient beings who have to go through all the eight hot hells all over again, which is really boundless suffering.

##### 2. Neighbouring Hells

After the living beings in the Hot Hells have eliminated the karma of the hot hells, they will go to the Neighbouring Hells to continue to suffer, and some were born in the Neighbouring Hells because of their karma from the beginning.

The Neighbouring Hells have four levels.

##### (1) Pit of Hot Embers

The living beings who have eliminated the karma of the hot hell have to come out of the hot hell and walk through a Pit of Hot Embers, as big as a grassland. The fire of the Pit of Hot Embers will not burn above the knee, but the All of the following will burn to scorch.

Karma is different, and the fire pool that is inspired by karma to manifest is not the same size.

Some sentient beings manifest in fire pits that are hundreds of kilometers wide, thousands of kilometers wide, or even wider.

Even if you keep walking, you won't be able to cross it for hundreds or thousands of years, and you won't be liberated.

247

##### (2) Swamp of Putrefying Corpses

The karma of the Swamp of Putrefying Corpses has been eliminated, and the Swamp of Putrefying Corpses has to be passed.

Swamp of Putrefying Corpses is a quagmire that is as big as the sea and full of rotting corpses.

When crossing the mud pond, the corpse mud in the mud pond will drown all the way to the neck, and there are many insects in the mud corpse, all of them come to bite the body, get into the body to suck blood and eat the flesh, the pain is unbearable.

This will take hundreds of years, thousands of years, and the karma is incredible, and it will take tens of thousands of years for those with heavy karma.

##### (3) Plain of Razor Sharp Blades

After passing through the Swamp of Putrefying Corpses, enter the sharp blade pond.

There are three types of sharp blade ponds:

##### 1) Plain of Razor Blades

Plain of Razor Sharp Blades is a road full of sharp blades.

After passing the Swamp of Putrefying Corpses, we enter a place that looks like a park. It is full of paths covered with sharp blades. We have to walk through it. There is no way to retreat.

248

##### 2) Forest of Sword Blades 

The Forest of Sword Blades is a large forest with many trees and all the leaves are swords.

Sentient beings pass through the Forest of Sword Blades. As soon as they get here, a strong wind blows, and swords fall from the trees and plunge into the body, causing unbearable pain.

Likewise, it takes a long time until the karma is exhausted.

##### 3) Iron Thorn Woods

After passing the Forest of Sword Blades, it enters the Iron Thorn Forest.

The iron thorn forest is very beautiful, and all beings will be very happy to see family members, relatives and friends all sitting in the trees.

At this time, his family asked him to come up. When he went up, all the leaves turned into sharp swords, and the sword's tip was downward. When he climbed, his body was torn apart, and he reached the top like this.

Having finally climbed to the top of the tree, due of their karma, they see that their family and friends were all under the tree again. Climbing down from the tree, the sharp blades of the swords are now pointed upwards, and penetrated when it went down. The internal organs are cut to pieces, the pain is unbearable.

Up and down like this, never ending.

In the process of climbing up and down, there are countless iron-billed eagles flying over, pecking their eyes and digging into their brains, and there will be groups of iron dogs and ferocious beasts under the trees, rushing to bite and eat.

249

(4) The Boundless River 

 After passing through the Iron Thorn Forest, one enters  the Boundless River.

The Boundless River is a river of salt water that has no banks and is very dirty.

After passing through the Sword Pond, the Sword Leaf Forest, and the Iron Thorn Forest, all beings were stabbed and chopped with injuries everywhere. These wounds came into contact with the salt water in the Boundless River, and the pain was unbearable.

It may take thousands of years to cross the Boundless River, depending on the amount of karma of the sentient beings.

After crossing the Boundless River, the causes of going to hell may have disappeared.

At this time, it depends on the amount of good fortune left by sentient beings. If the good fortune is large enough, they may be reborn as a poor person or a disabled person.

It is different for those who have studied Buddhism during their lifetime. After the death of a Buddhist practitioner, within seven to forty-nine days, there will usually be masters and Dharma friends who will recite the sutras for transference.

In this way, even if you go to hell, you will be freed quickly.

If our parents pass away, we as children, reciting the scriptures well within forty-nine days will be of great help to our parents, and it is the best way to repay our parents' kindness.

The bardo body that is going to go to hell is black. If the offspring recite more sutras, the bardo body will turn white and will be reborn in the pure lands.

250

In addition, the three Bodhisattvas, Guanyin, Manjusri, and Vajrapani often go to hell to save sentient beings.

When the bodhisattvas go to hell, all sentient beings who have studied Buddhism in their lifetime will know which bodhisattva is coming as soon as they hear the sound of the mantra of the bodhisattva, and when they think of the bodhisattva, they can be liberated from hell immediately.

The beings in hell who have not studied Buddhism are not so lucky. Because of their defilements, they cannot see the Bodhisattva at all, or the Bodhisattva they see has a ferocious and terrifying appearance, which will make them even more afraid and terrified.

However, it also eliminated a lot of karma.

##### 3. The Cold Hells

The cold hells are directly north of the hot hells. It is an overlapping structure. The layers are separated by 2,000 yojanas. Hell of Blisters, Hell of Burst Blisters, Hell of Clenched/Chattering Teeth, Hell of Lamentations, Hell of Groans, Hell of Utpala-like Cracks, Hell of Lotus-like Cracks, Hell of Great Lotus-like Cracks.

In the cold hells, there is no light such as sunlight, it is dark, and you can't see your fingers. The ground is covered with ice, and the wind and snow are mixed.

The lifespan of beings in the cold hell is half that of the corresponding hot hell, that is to say, the lifespan of the Hell of Blisters is half that of the Reviving Hell, and the lifespan of the Hell of Great Lotus-like Cracks is half the lifespan of the Hell of Ultimate Torment.

251

##### (1) Hell of Blisters

Among the cold hells, the one with the least degree of suffering is the Hell of Blisters. The living beings here are so cold that many chilblains and rashes appear on their bodies, and they are like this all their lives.

That's why it's called rash body hell.

##### (2) Hell of Burst Blisters

The Hell of Burst Blisters is the hell where the sores on the body are so cold that they are all cracked open.

##### (3) Hell of Clenched/Chattering Teeth

Hell of Clenched/Chattering Teeth is even more severe, so cold that it is impossible to speak, and can only make the sound of "Aqu Aqu".

##### (4) Hell of Lamentations

In the Hell of Lamentations, the cold is even more intense, and even "Aqu" cannot be called out, only a "squeaky" sound can be made from the back of the throat.

That's why it's called Hell of Lamentations.

##### (5) Hell of Groans

In the Hell of Groans, the cold is even worse, no sound can be made, only the sound of the gnashing of teeth and groaning can be heard.

252

##### (6)  Hell of Utpala-like Cracks 

The body freezes into a blue-blue color and splits like a green lotus, so it is called Qinglian Hell.

##### (7) Hell of Lotus-like Cracks

The cold of the red lotus hell intensifies, the skin freezes into purple red, the body cracks even more, and it cracks into the shape of a hundred-petaled red lotus, which is the red lotus hell.

##### (8) The Great Red Lotus Hell 

The Great Red Lotus Hell is a hell that freezes until the whole body turns purple, and the body splits like a thousand-petaled red lotus, so it is also called the Thousand Layers of Red Lotus Hell.

The Great Red Lotus Hell is the body frozen and cracked into more than a thousand pieces, some living beings even cracked into tens of thousands of pieces, all the internal organs are cracked, and the head, eyes, hands and feet are all cracked.

But even so, you can only suffer alive, you cannot die, not even faint, you can only say that the karma is incredible.

These are the cold hells.

The main reason for falling into the cold hell is stubbornness in clinging to wrong views.

253

For example, denying cause and effect and not believing in rebirth are relatively large and serious wrong views.

In addition, taking away the clothes offered to Buddha statues, or robbing other people's clothes, letting others freeze, or even freeze to death; intentionally freezing small animals to death, etc., will also lead to rebirth in the cold hells.

##### 4. Ephemeral Hells 

Ephemeral Hells are distributed around the world.

Some sentient beings wander in the desert, without food or drink, are grilled by hot air every day, but they cannot die; there are also sentient beings who are born in rocks, and sometimes when they mine mountains, they will find frogs, spiders and other animals in the hard rocks. These belong to the Ephemeral Hells.

In the past, a few people in our place threw a stone. After the stone cracked, a hole was found, and a large spider was found in the hole. The circumference of the hole was very smooth, you can see it, and I don't know how many years it has been inside.

There are frogs and even mice in the rocks found in some places.

These do not belong to the animal realm, they are scattered hells with animal appearances, and there are also many such scattered hells in the human world.

We have roughly talked about the suffering of beings in hell. The actual suffering of beings in hell is indescribable with words and ink. It is endless and boundless suffering.

254

When thinking of the suffering of beings in hell, we should also ask ourselves, will we go to hell in the future?

At this time, a strong sense of dread will gradually arise.

Fear of falling into the lower realms is one of the reasons for taking refuge in the Three Jewels. Those who believe in cause and effect will not be afraid.

In winter, if we take off our clothes outside, we won’t be able to stand it for even one night. Sentient beings in the cold hell will be frozen for hundreds of millions or tens of billions of years, and they can’t die even if they want to.

They don't even have the chance to commit suicide.

Therefore, when we think of sentient beings in hell, we need to show compassion and often recite "May all sentient beings be free from suffering and the causes of suffering."

Moreover, it is easier to arouse compassion when thinking like this.

Master Potowa said that liberation from hell into the human realm is millions of times more difficult, than starting from our human realm, and becoming a Buddha.

Master Dromtonpa also said that people today are pulling a big iron ball to the top of a mountain, and it has only been pulled halfway.

Because sentient beings will continue to work out their karma in the process of suffering in hell, for example, when their body is burned, hurt by jailers or other sentient beings, they will generate anger.

If you continue to create negative karma, you will continue to suffer, not to mention liberation from hell to the human realm, and even liberation to the comparatively mild suffering of the animal realm is very, very difficult.

255

##### （二）The Suffering of Hungry Ghosts

Five hundred yojanas below the ground of Jambudvipa, Kunan, is the realm of hungry ghosts, there is a city of hungry ghosts called Jepila. There is no grass, no running water, and the ground is like iron heated by the sun.

This is the place where all beings in the realm of hungry ghosts are reborn.

The usual cause of falling into the realm of hungry ghosts is miserliness and lack of generosity.

If a person is reluctant to give up anything, he may fall into the realm of hungry ghosts in the next life.

Or stealing the benefits of the Sangha; or deliberately not giving people enough food, they will fall into the realm of hungry ghosts.

These are the usual causes, and there are others.

All beings in the realm of hungry ghosts are womb-born, and a hungry ghost can have hundreds of children.

The belly of a hungry ghost is very large, like a hill, and its head is as small as an egg. Compared with the body, the neck is like a thin blade of grass, the mouth is as big as the eye of a needle, and the limbs are very small, like blades of tough grass.

The karma of beings in the realm of hungry ghosts is inconceivable. Although they are always very thirsty and hungry, they cannot find food and drink. If they can obtain even the saliva or excrement of pure bhikkhus, it will be a great reward.

Since they haven't eaten or drank for decades or hundreds of years, their whole body is dry and without water.

Withered skin covers with withered bones, like dead wood wrapped in dry leather.

When walking, the joints make a cracking sound and rub against each other.

256

Hungry ghosts have all kinds of suffering.

Often unable to find food, they experience the pain of extreme hunger and thirst; walking long, long distances brings the pain of exhaustion and disappointment; being driven out and slashed by other ghost kings they have the pain of extreme fear.

When the summer is hot, even the moon is hot, and the moonlight burns them to death; when the winter is cold, even the sun is very cold.

Hungry ghosts are further divided into three types: hungry ghosts with external obstacles, hungry ghosts with internal obstacles, and hungry ghosts with internal and external obstacles.

##### 1. Hungry ghosts with external obstacles

Hungry ghosts with external obstacles cannot find or see external things or food due to their karma. Such hungry ghosts are hungry ghosts with external obstacles.
For example, looking for water to drink, hungry ghost beings with external obstacles, either can't see water, can't find water; or can't see water nearby, and only see water in the far distance, usually a big river thousands of miles away. If they want to drink water, they have to keep walking, but because the limbs are very small, the walking is very slow, and it takes decades to walk.

When they finally get there, but because of karma, they couldn't see the water again, or when they arrived, they found that the water had dried up.

There are others where the water turns into thick blood or pus as soon as you get there. The kind of blood that makes you want to vomit as soon as you see it.

If you are not afraid, even if it is thick blood, you have to drink it, but then, you will find that there are sentient beings watching over you, such as some earth gods, evil ghosts, and demons, holding swords and guarding the water, and when hungry ghosts arrive at the water they are  driven away, and their bodies were cut, and their limbs were cut off.

257

They really can't find anything, and they can only eat themselves in the end.

Eat their own flesh and drink their own blood.

##### 2. Hungry ghosts with internal obstructions 

Hungry ghosts with internal obstructions can see food and get food, but when they eat it, it turns into fire; or when they eat, it turns into feces and other very dirty things.
Such a hungry ghost is a hungry ghost with internal obstacle.

The ghost fires we often talk about are not the ghosts setting fires, but generally the food found by the hungry ghosts in the internal obstacles turns into fire.

Sometimes on a night when no one is there, a light shines, and it is gone in a few minutes.

Often it is a little bit here, a little bit there, and disappears after a while.

We often saw it when we were children, and now we occasionally see it in the countryside or in the wild, and this is generally the case.

##### 3. Hungry Ghosts with Internal and External Obstacles

258


They couldn't find anything to eat, and even if they found it, it is blocked by their huge Adam's apple, and they can't swallow it.

Or even if the mouth takes the food in, the stomach will never be full.

Such a hungry ghost is a hungry ghost with internal and external obstacles.

All beings in the ghost realm also belong to the realm of hungry ghosts, but the realm of hungry ghosts discussed here is different from the realm of ghosts.

Beings in the ghost realm live in the human world, and their appearance is similar to our human appearance, but it is not the appearance of a previous life, but a different appearance inspired by karma.

Beings in the ghost realm have some supernatural powers, they can see their past lives, know their past lives, and they can also transform into past lives; in terms of food and drink, they can only get the alms of chasing cigarette offerings, others can see, but they can’t catch.

We should always think about whether we also have the karma of falling into the realm of hungry ghosts: if we are stingy and steal things, these will all lead to falling into the realm of hungry ghosts.

Some people keep animals, and if they don’t give them food or drink, they will also fall into the realm of hungry ghosts; some people’s parents are old, and their children do not cook or take care of them, and eventually their parents starve to death. There are many such things in society today. In future rebirths they will fall into the realm of hungry ghosts.

There was a family with five boys. A few decades ago, it was very difficult for everyone. With five boys in the family, eating was a big problem. You can imagine how difficult it is to raise five boys.

When these five boys grew up, they became five big bosses. As a result, the mothers of the five big bosses starved to death. 

259

If these five sons do not fall into hell in the next life, 100% sure they will fall into the realm of hungry ghosts.

##### (3) The bitter animal path is also known as the side path. 

It is stated in the "Discourse on the Stages of Yogic Practice":

"Live with people and heaven, and have no other place to live", which means that animals live together with people and all living beings in the heavenly way, and it is widely distributed.

The animal realm can be divided into the animal realm of the human world and the animal realm of the ocean.

In the "Abhidharma-kośa-śāstra", it is said that the original dwelling place of animal life is the sea, and there are more sentient beings in the sea than in the human world, and the sentient beings of the animal world flow out from the ocean. They have a short and uncertain lifespan.

Animals have common suffering, namely, ignorance, lack of food, fear, helplessness, and the strong prey on the weak.

##### 1. Ignorance

Ignorance, unknowing, and no wisdom.

For example, other beings want to kill or harm them, but they don't know.

When a candle is lit, many flying insects fly into the flame, not knowing that they would be burned by the fire.

There is no such basic discernment and wisdom, let alone one who can learn Buddha's liberation.

260

##### 2. Lack of food

Lack of food is always a lack of something to eat.
Usually, all living beings starve to death, but especially wild animals.

There are also animals who are not short of food, such as pets, because their good fortune and blessings are different.

##### 3. Constant Fear

Beings in the animal realm are in fear every day.
Fear of people and other animals.

For example, the little rabbit among animals, if we walk gently over to it, it will run away immediately.

Even if it is sleeping, it will notice and run away.

This is how all living beings in the animal realm have a sense of fear at all times, and live in constant fear.

##### 4. No Protection

When sentient beings in the animal realm are killed, there is often no one to help and protect them, and they are always helpless.

261

##### 5. The strong eat the weak

The weak and the strong kill each other, the strong devour the weak, and the weak bite the strong.


The above briefly talked about the suffering of sentient beings in the animal realm.

Falling into the realm of animals is easy.

If you disrespect the Dharma and the Dharma master, you will fall into the animal realm; if you use animal names to scold your friends, you will fall into the animal realm; if you insult and make fun of the Sangha, for example, saying that a monk is as agile as a monkey, and he thinks nothing of it, in the next life you will become a monkey; joking that monks are as loyal as dogs, and you will become a dog in the next life.

Moreover, after falling into the animal realm, you will be reborn continuously, and after death you will be reborn in the animal realm, usually hundreds of times in a row.

Think about ourselves, have we ever insulted monks? Scolded our parents? Cursed our benefactor? If you think about it, you will find that there will definitely be some examples. These are all causes of falling into the animal realm, and you must repent.

Right now, we don’t have that kind of immersive feeling in our hearts. If we really become a dog or a pig, what will we feel, so we are not so afraid in our hearts.

When Translator Geruo was alive, there were many non-humans in Tibet. There was a kind of non-human called Chaman. A Chaman looked human on the outside, but in fact he was a kind of non-human.

262

Once, a female Chaman was knitting yarn on the roof. There was a small stone hanging under the tools for knitting the yarn. The stone fell. She picked it up.

This scene was seen by her son, and he was surprised, and he secretly kept watch on his mother.

In the middle of the night, he saw his mother fly away on a big box, and fly back when it was almost dawn.

The next night, he hid in the box ahead of time. When the box flew, the Chaman noticed that there was something wrong with the box, it seemed to be heavy.

The box flew somewhere, and there were many Chamans there, and everyone made offerings from the corpses in the tombs.

After she was done, the female Chaman sat on the big box and flew home again. On the way back, she knew that her son was hiding in the box. With a blow on his head, she turned her son  into a dog.

After she had turned her son was into a dog, he was in great pain and ran around, hoping someone would save him.

Once, he ran in front of Master Langri Tangba. The master had supernatural powers, and saw it, and said to him: "Tomorrow, a group of people will go to see the translator Geruo. You can follow them, and the translator Geruo can save you."

The next day he followed, and when he arrived at Translator Geruo's place, Translator Geruo knew about the child's situation, prepared torma, removed his spell, and turned him back into a human.

263

How painful it was to be a dog. He felt that even if he went to hell, he would not have such great pain. He wanted to speak, but he couldn't say anything, and he wanted to eat something that no one would give him.

264

#### Section 3 - Refuge 

This part is about taking refuge.

There are two kinds of refuges. In Southern Buddhism and Chinese Buddhism there are three refuges, and Tibetan Buddhism is a combined practice of exoteric and tantric practice. Therefore, we are talking about four refuges.

##### 1. Reasons for taking refuge in the Three Jewels

Of the Three Evil Realms, no matter which realm one falls into, one will suffer a lot of pain. 

If one thinks deeply about these sufferings, deep dread will arise.

Think again: in the face of the fear of falling into the lower realms, who can save us? Only the Guruand the  Three Jewels! If we go to hell, the Buddha can save us, this is the Buddha's treasure; Dharma friends can recite the sutras to save us, it is the Dharma treasure; the Bodhisattvas can save us, it is the Sangha's treasure.

Therefore, from this moment onwards, the heart of taking refuge in the Three Jewels arises.

There are two basic reasons for taking refuge in the Three Jewels: one is the dread of the three evil realms; the other is confidence in the Three Jewels.

These two reasons are the reasons for the conversion of the practitioners of lower abilities, and they are also the fundamental reasons for conversion.

Only when these two causes are possessed can one truly take refuge and truly enter into Buddhism.

These two reasons are the minimum conditions for entering Buddhism.

265

Some people take refuge in the Three Jewels because of illness, while others take refuge because they are broke, and others take refuge in order to live a long life.

Being able to take refuge in the Three Jewels is a good thing, and you can accumulate the merit of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas, but these are not the real motivation for taking refuge.

Many people who study Buddhism, after studying Buddhism for a long time, feel that they still have many obstacles and problems. Why is this? 

It is because the mind has not yet truly taken refuge, only verbally taking refuge, that is, following the guru to recite the Four Refuge texts, thinking that this is the way to take refuge, but there is no real dread of the evil realms or confidence in the Three Jewels.

If you have the intention of taking refuge in the way of the lower aspect, and truly take refuge in the Three Jewels of the Guru, you will definitely receive more powerful and quicker merit from the Three Jewels! Negative karma and troubles will also decrease rapidly.

The reason for the conversion of the people of middle scope is the fear of the six realms of rebirth.

Not only is there a dread of falling into the evil realms, but there is also a fear of the suffering of the human realm and the realm of gods.

Then think about it again: in the suffering of the six realms of rebirth, only the guru, the Three Jewels, can save us.

Believing in the Three Jewels of the Guru is the second reason for the people of middle scope to take refuge.

The reason for taking refuge in people of upper scope is that they cannot bear the suffering of all beings in the six realms of rebirth.

The six realms of samsara have gross suffering and subtle suffering.

In people of middle scope, there is only a fear of gross pains, and in people of upper scope, there is an additional fear of the most subtle pains.

266

When the sages are on the way, they are afraid of the pain caused by the obstacles of knowledge. They realize that the only one who can save all living beings and can break the obstacles of their own knowledge is the guru, the Three Jewels.

This is the reason for the refuge of the people of upper scope.

The real refuge is to learn, and through learning, to understand the cause of refuge, the object of refuge, the quality of refuge, the virtues and benefits that will be gained by taking refuge.

Once we have an understanding of these six aspects, we can understand what taking refuge really means.

The most basic real conversion we are talking about now refers to the taking refuge of the people of lower scope.

There are two reasons for taking refuge, one is to take refuge because of the dread of falling into the lower realms; the other is to take refuge because of faith in the guru and the Three Jewels.

The object of taking refuge is the guru and the Three Jewels. Let's look at other aspects.

##### 2. Scale of the Benefits of Refuge 

There are extents of Refuge: taking refuge after knowing the merits and virtues of the Three Jewels, taking refuge when knowing the difference between the Three Jewels, knowing the difference between taking refuge in the Three Jewels and keeping the precepts, and not taking refuge in any object other than the Three Jewels.

##### (1) Knowing the merits of the Three Jewels and taking refuge 

After understanding the merits of the Three Jewels, taking refuge in the Three Jewels means knowing the merits of the Three Jewels and taking refuge.

First of all, we must understand why we take refuge in the guru, why we take refuge in the Three Jewels.

Why do we take refuge in the guru? What are the virtues of a guru? What are the virtues of the Three Jewels? We have already talked about the merits of the guru. The guru is the representative of the Three Jewels, and we want to obtain the merit of the Buddhas and Tathagatas, the blessings of the Three Jewels.

However, all the Buddhas and Tathagatas are first integrated into the guru. Only through the guru can they bless us. This is a contingent origin between the master and the apprentice. Even many masters who are the incarnations of the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas must take refuge in the guru.

Then, let's look at the merits of the Three Jewels.

##### 1. Buddha's merits 

Buddhas have inconceivable merits of body, speech and mind.

##### (1) Buddha's body merits 

The Buddha's dharma form, simply speaking, is the Buddha's body.

The appearance of the Buddha is very dignified. When the Buddha is teaching the sutras, some people look at him without blinking. After he has finished teaching the sutras, they still go on staring, and even a hundred years of listening is not enough. The Buddha has such physical merit.

The Buddha has thirty-two principal marks and eighty sublime marks.

"Xiang" means that the owner is a man, and "good" is a symbol of inner merit.

268

If you can constantly think about the good qualities of the Buddha's appearance and the causes of the good qualities of the Buddha's appearance, the practice will be more blessed.

Nagarjuna Bodhisattva said in the "The Madhyamika Theory" "Precious Garland" when he talked about the good qualities of the Buddha:

---

If you add up the merits of the Solitary Arhats, the Shravakas, and the endless merits of the world, and then multiply by ten times, you can only achieve one "pore shape" of the Buddha's body; One hundred times, one kind of "good" can be achieved; one hundred times of all the eighty kinds of good merits can be achieved; one kind of "sign" can be achieved; one thousand times of all the thirty-two kinds of blessings can be achieved of the Buddha's "Bai Hao appearance"; only one hundred thousand times the blessing of the white hair appearance can achieve the "top bun appearance" of the Buddha; only one thousand times the blessing of the top bun appearance can achieve the blessing of "Buddha language and Sanskrit sound".

---

In addition, the various parts of the Buddha's appearance and goodness have the function of spreading the Dharma.

The top bun and pores have the function of mind, which can clearly see deep and vast all dharmas.

Therefore, the body of the Buddha pervades all knowledge, and the words of the Buddha and the mind of the Buddha pervade all at the same time.

In the "Inconceivable Sutra on the Secrets of the Tathagata", it says:

Wisdom is everywhere, and the body is like a foot.

269

Therefore, it is said that all worlds are reflected in the Buddha's body, and the Buddha's body pervades all the worlds.

The secret of the Buddha's body is inconceivable.

For example, the Buddha's top bun looks only four fingers high when looking up, but the real height is immeasurable.

In the "Inconceivable Sutra on the Secrets of the Tathagata", it is said that Bodhisattva Holding Li used his supernatural powers to fly up through the boundless worlds, but he was never able to see the top of the Buddha's bun, and finally returned exhausted.

The Buddha's body is a rainbow body with a bright, clean and bright body. The light shines. The "Vinaya Sutra" uses three metaphors to praise the Buddha's body:

add fire to the body;

like ghee full of fire;

Such as lamps in gold.

Every kind of light emitted by the Buddha's body can mature and liberate countless sentient beings; in front of every living being, the Buddha can transform into a body that he can accept, and speak in a language he can understand.

In addition, when people see the Buddha body, they will have the wish of ​​wanting to obtain the Buddha body, and they will pursue and accumulate the merits of becoming the Buddha body, which is also a kind of aspirational merit of the Buddha body.

The Buddha's clothes are always separated from the body by four fingers, but people who come to worship the Buddha can clearly see the outline of the Buddha's body; the Buddha's feet do not touch the ground, but can clearly leave a pattern with the Dharma wheel on the ground in the footprint.

270

If ants and other sentient beings happen to enter the path of the Buddha's feet while the Buddha was walking, they would be immersed in great happiness for seven days and then be reborn in the heavenly realm.

"Yuzan" praises the Buddha's physical virtues:

With a dignified and dignified body, with a wonderful eye and dew,

Like the cloudless autumn sky, the stars are solemn.

Nengren is golden, the dharma robes are strictly covered,

It is equivalent to the top of the golden mountain, bound by the clouds.

Respected parents without strict ornaments, the face wheel is extremely full,

The full moon wheel from the cloud is also incomparable.

The wonderful lotus in the mouth, and the lotus opened with the sun,

Bee sees doubts and agrees, turning it like a rope.

The mask is golden, the teeth are white,

Like the pure autumn moonlight, shining into the golden mountain gap.

The right hand should be offered for the special decoration of the wheel,

Soothing with hands, life and death are terrifying.

When Nengren marches, his feet are like wonderful lotuses,

How can the lotus garden be beautiful on this land?

##### (2) The merits of Buddha's speech 

271

A Buddha has sixty-four qualities of speech.

Master Tsongkhapa said on the basis of the Ocean of Clouds of Praise: The Essence of Truth:

---

All sentient beings in the world ask doubts in one moment,

A Buddha’s speech resounds to the entire circle of those around him. Whether the listener is close or far, everyone hears his voice with equal volume the same as if he or she were sitting right up front.

---

When Buddha Shakyamuni preached the sutras, if you listened to it in the front of the crowd, the sound would not be loud; if you listened to it from far away, the sound would not be too soft, and it sounded the same.

After the disciples hear it, they will feel that every sentence hits their own troubles, and every sentence is useful.

Especially when people of different races listen to the scriptures together, what they hear from the Buddha is the language they are familiar with, what the Chinese hear is Chinese, and what the Tibetans hear is Tibetan.

Buddhas can answer different questions asked by people of different roots at the same time, and what everyone hears is the answer to their own question.

Buddha Shakyamuni has such inconceivable qualities of speech.

In "Hymn of 150 Verses", when praising the merits of the Buddha's speech, it says:

---

Guan Zun's face is lovely, from what he heard,

Extremely and elegant voice, such as the moon Wang Ganlu.

Reverence can be quiet, greed is like a rain cloud;

Uprooting the venomous snake is equivalent to the wonderful winged bird;

Destroy the most ignorant, obscured like the sun;

By destroying my slow mountain, it is also waiting for King Kong.

Seeing righteousness without deceit, without fault therefore obeying,

Good affixes are easy to understand, and respectful words are good to say.

The first time I hear the words of the venerable one, I can capture the mind of those who hear it,

If right thinking is next, it will also eliminate all greed and delusion.

To congratulate all lacks, all liberations return,

Today, those who are happy are tired of leaving, and the words of respect are commensurate with each other.

Those who can produce wisdom rejoice, those who can increase wisdom,

Those who can destroy the shadows, these words benefit all living beings.

##### (3) The Merit of the Buddha's Mind

Buddha has great compassion, great wisdom, and perfect ability.

1) The Buddha's Compassion, Merit, Great Compassion, and Great Compassion, refers to the Buddha's Compassion and Merit.

The Buddha sees that all living beings in the six realms are equal, and loves every living being, and the Buddha's compassion is different from ours.

"One Hundred and Fifty Praises" says:

---

All these beings, there is no difference between delusion and bondage,

In order to solve the confusion of sentient beings, respect for a long time as the bondage of sorrow.

---

273

We ordinary people generally have compassion when we see suffering beings, sometimes with compassion, sometimes without; sometimes our compassion grows and sometimes it decreases.

And because the Buddha has always seen that all living beings are suffering, his great compassion never stops, and he constantly saves all living beings.

##### 2) The wisdom, merit, and virtue of the Buddha 

The great wisdom is the wisdom, merit and virtue of the Buddha.

All the principles of Dharma, all the principles of dependent arising, all realms, Buddhas can understand.

The wisdom of the Buddha can arise at anytime, anywhere, without hindrance.

In "Zan Ying Zan" says:

---

The World-Honored Dharma of the fallen age, 

the origin of all species,

Like a sour fruit in the palm of your hand, 

it is a state of respect for the mind.

All dharmas move and not move, 

if one or all,

Like the wind in the sky, 

there is no hindrance in respect.

---

In the first four sentences, the Buddha sees the causes of dependent origination of all dharmas very clearly, just like looking at the ummara fruit in his hand (a kind of almost transparent fruit found in India at that time), which is the realm of Buddha's intention.

274

The last four sentences are to say that all dharmas, whether in the world of sentient beings or in the world of objects, when the Buddha's mind observes these things, is like the wind in the sky, without hindrance, fully understood, without the slightest doubt.

This is the merit of the Buddha's will to distinguish, that is, the merit of the Buddha's wisdom.

The merits of the Buddha's mind also include the perfection of the Buddha's ability.

The ability of the Buddha is indescribable and inexhaustible.

For example, the Buddha is everywhere, blessing sentient beings all the time, as long as our pure faith is sincere, we can immediately obtain the blessing of the Buddha.

The merits of the Buddha's mind are the most wonderful.

Everyone should know that from the day of taking refuge, Buddhas and Bodhisattvas are by our side, following us like shadows and protecting us.

Whatever pain or trouble we have, the Buddha knows that the Buddha has this kind of wisdom, which is the merit of the Buddha's mind.

Not only does the Buddha have this kind of wisdom, but he also has a great compassion that never diminishes.

Other gods, or Arhats, have limited ability of mind, merit or supernatural powers, and cannot understand all the sufferings of living beings.

For example, after an arhat enters samadhi, he will not know the suffering of all sentient beings; nor will ordinary worldly gods know the suffering of everyone.

If we are in danger and ask for help from ordinary gods in the world, even if he knows, he may not be able to save us.

Even if they have power, they may not be able to save us.

Because ordinary gods do not have great compassion and compassion, only the Buddha who has great compassion, has the ability, and will definitely save us! It is because the Buddha has the most perfect and supreme mind and merit.

275

The Dharma's merits and virtues are the magic weapon that guides us out of the sea of ​​samsara.
It includes the truth of extinction, the five paths and ten bhumis, etc., of seeing the way, the way of meditation, and so on.

If we think about where the inconceivable merits of Buddhas come from, we can understand that the Dharma has the merits of producing inconceivable merits like Buddhas.

Just as it is said in the "Zhengshe Dharma Sutra": 

---

"All Buddhas, World-honored Ones, 

all boundless and boundless merits arise from the Dharma, 

receive and practice the Dharma, 

and are manifested by the Dharma.

According to the right law, the law is done.”

---

What methods do Buddhas generally use to save sentient beings? 

They mainly use the method of teaching scriptures and spreading the Dharma.

Therefore, in order to deal with the 84,000 afflictions of sentient beings, Buddha Shakyamuni taught 84,000 dharma-doors. 

Each dharma-door is a method for dealing with afflictions. As long as you study the Buddha hard, your wisdom will become higher and higher. Troubles will be fewer and fewer.

Some people say that after studying Buddhism for a period of time, they had no worries when they weren't studying Buddhism, but after studying Buddhism they have more and more troubles.

Actually, it's not that the afflictions have increased, it's that they didn't recognize these afflictions before. After they learned Buddhism, they realized and observed their afflictions. This is a kind of progress.

276

Knowing that you have so many troubles, and then learning how to deal with them, you will be able to cut off the troubles one by one.

After you cut off your afflictions, you will be truly liberated. At this time, even if the happiness of all beings in the six realms was added up, it cannot compare to the happiness of a liberated person.

The Buddhadharma talks about the methods of getting rid of suffering and attaining happiness, and it also includes the methods of the world.

For things in the world, for example, if we want to get wealth, the Buddhadharma tells us to practice more generosity, which is the cause for getting wealth; and then work hard, and then we will definitely be rich.

No matter from the perspective of the world or the gods, the benefits of Buddhism to all sentient beings are very, very great.

Because the merits of the Dharma are so extraordinary, we must take refuge in the Dharma.

##### 3. Merits of the Sangha

The Sangha are Dharma friend who practise with us or inspire us to practise. High-level monks are Arhats and Bodhisattvas. Sangha has different qualities at different stages and at different stages of fruition.
For example, the sravaka, who is in the position of entering and practicing the path, can access the Four Nobles and the sixteen signs in a comparable way; in the position of seeing the path, he can realize emptiness; in the position of practicing the path, he can gradually eliminate the eighty-one kinds of afflictions.

A monk who has attained Arhatship has even greater virtues: he can change objects from more to less; he can display various changes by means of samadhi; he can reach any sentient beings who want to be liberated.

277

Due to the accumulation of merit over hundreds of kalpas, Yuanjue Arhats have a thousand times more merits and virtues than Shravaka Arhats.

The merits of Bodhisattvas are even more incredible. According to the Mahayana teachings, to become a Buddha requires the accumulation of merit over three uncountable kalpas.

A Bodhisattva who has practised the path of accumulation and added the path of "superiority and understanding" can realise emptiness through listening, thinking, and practice, and obtain the sufficiency of the first asamkhya; a bodhisattva who is on the Path of Seeing diligently practises the paramita of giving of the ten paramitas; then, with the continuous deepening of the practice, the bodhisattvas of the second to tenth bhumis of the path can gradually complete the other nine kinds of perfections.

To put it simply, the first seven bhumis of the Bodhisattva have completed the merits and virtues of the second asamkhya kalpa.

The merits of Ascendant Bodhisattvas can also be subdivided.

A bodhisattva of the first bhumi can obtain twelve hundred kinds of merits in an instant: 

manifest one hundred emanations; 

for each of these bodies, manifest one hundred attendants; 

see the birth and death of a hundred kalpas; 

cause one hundred world systems to shake; 

enter into and arise from one hundred samādhi meditations in a single instant; 

see one hundred buddhas face to face, and receive their blessings; 

manifest in one hundred aeons in a single instant; 

travel to one hundred buddha realms;

open one hundred doors to the Dharma;

bring one hundred beings to complete maturity; 

live in the world for a hundred kalpas.

Twelve merits are multiplied through each bhumi or stage, one by one, the second is a thousand, the third is a hundred thousand, the fourth is a hundred kos, the fifth is a thousand kos, the sixth is a hundred thousand kos, and the seventh is a hundred thousand kos. In the eighth bhumi the merits are the number of dust particles in one hundred and three thousand great thousand worlds, in the ninth bhumi merits are of the number of dust particles in one million Asamkh worlds, and in the tenth bhumi the merits are of the magnitude of the number of dust particles in the indescribable and immeasureable three thousand great thousand worlds.

278

The above has explained the different qualities of the Sangha. 

You need to study and understand the scriptures more, and you will feel that, as the major scriptures say, the virtues of the Sangha are immeasurable.

We have already understood the merits of the Three Jewels of Buddha, Dharma and Sangha, and we need to think more about the merits of the Three Jewels at ordinary times.

Until we have strong confidence in the merits and abilities of the Guru of the Three Jewels, realize that only the Three Jewels can save us, and then take refuge in the Three Jewels with this sincere heart of faith.

##### (2) Knowing the difference between the Three Jewels and taking refuge 

There are six aspects: 

the difference in physical nature; 

the difference in career; 

the difference in belief and understanding; 

the difference in practice; 

the difference in mindfulness; 

the difference in life and happiness.

279

##### 1. Physical Differences 




The Buddha is the supremely enlightened one, the one who now realizes enlightenment.

Dharma is the empirical teaching of the enlightened one.

The Sangha are practitioner of the Dharma.

##### 2. Differences in role 

The Buddha's role is to teach the scriptures and to save sentient beings.

The role of the Dharma is to make the minds of all sentient beings follow the Dharma, eliminate karmic obstacles, cut off afflictions, and liberate from samsara.

The role of a monk (the Sangha) is to be brave and diligent, and to spread all good dharmas.

##### 3. Difference in understanding 

Buddha is the object of worship and offering.

Dharma is the content of actual practice.

A monk is a good friend and a friend of the Dharma.

##### 4. Differences in practise

The cultivation of Buddha is to make offerings and vows. 

Facing the Dharma is to practice the Dharma. 

To deal with the Sangha is to live in harmony with the Sangha in practice and life.

##### 5. Difference of mindfulness

Often recalls the merits of the Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha, and can cultivate the belief and pure confidence in the Three Jewels.

In the "The Noble Sūtra of Recalling the Three Jewels", the difference between reciting the Three Jewels is explained in detail:

280

---

Homage to the omniscient one!

---

The Tibetan version of this sutra is very comfortable to read, and it is also very special. We should read it more often when we have time.

##### 6.  Difference between life and blessings 

A Buddha can develop merit by virtue of one sentient being.

The Sangha develop merit by virtue of many sentient beings, because when there are more than four disciples together they constitute a Sangha. 

Buddha and Sangha are said to be compassionate sentient beings.

Sentient beings rely on the Dharma to develop merit.

Therefore, taking refuge in the Buddha is taking refuge with the heart of offering and reverence; taking refuge in the Dharma is taking refuge in order to make the Dharma arise in one’s heart.

##### (3) Refuge according to the different vows of the Three Jewels 

When taking refuge, you must make an oath, and take refuge in accordance with different vows to each of the Three Jewels:

Take refuge in the Buddha as a guide leading us to liberation.

Take refuge in the Dharma as the contents of the teaching leading to liberation and reaching Nirvana.

282

Take refuge in the Sangha as a Dharma friend and companion in the practice leading to liberation.

##### (4) Do not take refuge in anything other than the Three Jewels 

There was a wise man who was followed another religion, who later converted to Buddhism and finally became a great achiever.

He wrote a book called "Praise of the Sages", in which he said:

I do not favour the Buddha, 

nor do I hate the other paths,

Whoever preaches what is reasonable, 

I believe in that.

The wise man compared various aspects of Buddhism and other religions, including the great teacher of Buddhism Shakyamuni Buddha and the patriarchs of other religions, their teachings, achievements and so on.

Concluding that the Three Jewels of Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha are superior to all other religions, he finally converted to Buddhism.

From this, we must also understand that only the Buddha and the Three Jewels can free us from the suffering of samsara.

Therefore, we only take refuge in the Three Jewels, the Buddha, and no other religions.

In addition, the Buddha is the most supreme, wisdom and merit are the most perfect.

After taking refuge in the Three Jewels, our blessings will be great. If we take refuge in other religions,spirits or gods, they will not be able to bear our blessings and will be very unhappy. Not only do they have no blessings to give, but they may also hinder us.

283

Buddha has cut off the obstacles of knowledge and afflictions, and his wisdom and ability are the most perfect, and there is no defect at all.

Venerable Tudun and the Buddha were contemporaries. He used to be a leader of another religion, but later he converted to Buddhism and wrote an article praising the Buddha called "Extraordinary Praise". There is a paragraph in it:

---

I abandon Master Yu,
and take refuge in the Blessed One,

Why take refuge in the Buddha, 

if there is no excess of virtue.

---

Venerable Tuton, as the leader of another religion, eventually left that religion because he felt that the teachings of that religion did not make sense in many ways.

For example, followers of other religions beleive that all things are created by the "Lord", and human beings are also created by the "Lord". So who created the "Lord"? 

Later, they read the Buddhist scriptures, study for a long time, and realize that the Buddha's teachings are the most reasonable, the merits are the most perfect, and the realization is ultimate, so they take refuge in the Buddha and the Three Jewels.

It is also stated in the "Exalted Praise":

---

All foreign paths, think like this,

Each of them competed carefully, 

and my heart became more and more believing of Buddhism.

It is not a pervasive wisdom sect, and its heart is broken by transgressions,

Since his mind is broken and chaotic, he has never seen a Buddha that is inexorable.

Because outsiders cannot access ultimate wisdom, it leads to all kinds of Wrong Views.

284

Once the concept is wrong, you will see things upside down and confused, so you will be wrong when you look at the perfect Buddha. Therefore, Venerable Tudun said that "since the mind is corrupt and chaotic, it is impossible to see the Buddha."

In addition, in the history of other religions, there are many instances of fighting and killing.

Buddhism talks about great mercy and great compassion. Not only can we not kill living beings, but we must also generate great love to save them. This is also an important difference between Buddhism and other religions.

3. After taking refuge, how to learn, practice, and uphold the vows 

After taking refuge in the Three Jewels, we have entered the Buddhist path and are true disciples of the Buddha.

From the disciple's point of view, it is very important to understand what should be learned, what rules should be observed, and what is strictly forbidden, which is different from before taking refuge.

After taking refuge in the Buddha, because the Buddha is a good teacher and the supreme teacher, after taking refuge in the Buddha, you should try to associate with good people and good teachers.

After taking refuge in the Dharma, you must study and cultivate various teachings and proofs. You must keep your mind alert when you hear it, and always be prepared to think of countermeasures and elimination of your troubles.

After taking refuge in the Sangha, you should regard the Sangha treasure as a good friend and helper in your practice, diligently listen and think, diligently develop the precepts, concentration, and wisdom, and follow the practice of the Sangha.

285

After taking refuge, you should also pay attention to four aspects: Always pay attention to protecting the six sense organs, and do not pay attention to unhealthy things,

So as not to increase the troubles and hinder the study; Take and uphold the corresponding precepts according to your actual situation; You should have compassion for sentient beings and not harm them; Always think about making offerings to the Three Jewels.

(1) Classification of precepts that should be observed after taking refuge in the Three Jewels 

This part is divided into two aspects, abstinence and precepts.

Abstinence and precepts include three aspects: taking refuge in the Buddha, not in gods and other spirits; taking refuge in the Dharma, not harming sentient beings; taking refuge in the Sangha, not making evil friends.
These are called prohibitions, which were detailed in the Great Parinirvana Sutra.
 
(1) Those who have taken refuge in the Buddha, but not in gods and spirits, "The Great Parinirvana Sutra" says:

"If you take refuge in the Three Jewels, 

it is a matter of right and true, 

and you should never take refuge in other gods and spirits."

The difference between other religions and Buddhism has been discussed before, and we understand that only Buddhism has the true Dharma of liberation, which can lead sentient beings to Nirvana.

286

Therefore, after taking refuge in the Buddha, we never take refuge in other religions, not to mention those ordinary ghosts, gods, dragons, and various immortals, snake immortals, python immortals, Huang Da immortals, and local minor gods, etc. Many places make customary offerings to these gods.

If you often make offerings to these spirits and gods and pray sincerely, you will unconsciously generate belief in them, and you will lose your refuge in the Three Jewels.

After taking refuge in the Buddha, relying on the splendor of the Three Jewels, our precious human body has already surpassed those spirits and gods. 

When some people encounter difficulties, it is very wrong to abandon the blessings of the Three Jewels and ask for the help of spirits and gods.

For example, the gods of the earth, the gods of great freedom, and the gods of the gods, we cannot take refuge in them, because they have no ability to save us from rebirth.

Monks never bow down to worship these worldly gods. The blessings of the monks' precepts are very great, and they cannot bear it.

If we take the five vows, we should not kneel and worship, they will also be unhappy because they cannot bear this blessing.

However, you can make offerings to these worldly gods, and you can ask them for help in worldly affairs, such as asking them to help heal diseases, make money, and so on.

Everyone must remember that the only one who can save us from the pain of the three evil realms is the Guru, the Three Jewels, and no other spirits or gods have this ability.

287

For spirits and gods, if you ask them to help support the cause of Buddhism, it is fine; however, if it is contrary to the principles of Buddhism, do not ask for it.

In addition, once you have converted to Buddhism, and then convert to the words of spirits and gods, the original belief has become a different belief, and the different belief is also a new kind of trouble.

(2) After taking refuge in the Dharma, the Dharma does not harm any living beings. 

The Dharma of Buddhism has great compassion, which is an important difference between Buddhism and other religions.

Buddha Shakyamuni did not enter Nirvana after becoming a Buddha. This was because he had compassion for all beings and taught the Dharma in order to liberate all beings.

It can be said that the fundamental feature of Buddhism is compassion, so after taking refuge in the Dharma, one must not harm living beings.

Don't even have this thought, let alone kill sentient beings.

(3) Those who have taken refuge in Sangha and do not make evil friends from other sects The "evil sectarian friends" here refers to those who will slander the Three Jewels.

Because we have just taken refuge, and our confidence and view of the Three Jewels are not strong enough, we are more easily influenced by these people at this point.

288

Therefore, unless you really have the ability to measure the other party, you should stay away from these evil friends.

Moreover, evil friends often harm others, and some evil friends are even murderers and terrorists, and such friends are even more unacceptable.

Once I went to Europe to teach the Dharma, and some Catholics invited me to go. They believe in Buddhism and God. We may find it strange. Even so, as long as you keep listening to it, after a long time, you will be absorbed by the Three Treasures. Gradually, you will develop pure faith in the Three Jewels.

In any case, there is a difference between those who have faith and those who do not. No matter which religion, they all exhort people to do good things and not to do evil things. In this regard they are all the same.

However, the right view is different, the understanding of good deeds and the Dharma are different, and some religions do not agree that the evil things we see as evil are really evil things.

For example, Brahmanism. The leader of Brahmanism said that the creator of all things is the Great Brahma, and the Great Brahma created all things, so we are all the sons of the Great Brahma.

Then, when we steal something, we take what belongs to our father, and there is no sin for a son to take what belongs to his father.

But in our Buddhist view, this is not allowed. We talk about cause and effect, and if we create the cause of stealing, there will be evil retribution. This is the difference in right view.

Some people lack discernment in this area, so pay more attention.

289

Until you have the ability to save such evil friends, or even distinguish them, you should stay away from them and not associate with these people for the sake of your own Dharma body and wisdom.

Keeping the precepts is what we should abide by, including three points:

If you have taken refuge in the Buddha, you must respect the images of the Buddha.

Once you have taken refuge in the Dharma, you must respect the Dharma.

Once you have taken refuge in the Sangha, you must respect the Sangha.

Beginners to Buddhism are prone to offend these three points, and unknowingly accumulate a lot of bad karma.

(1) Respect for images of the Buddha 

For Buddha images, whether they are statues or portraits; whether they are gilded or clay sculptures, made of copper, or other materials, all should be respected.

No matter how it looks or feels, there should be no sarcasm or rash remarks.

Do not put it in a dirty place, where it is easy to break.

Do not use these images in pawn shops, make decorative toys and so on.

The Buddha statue should be regarded as a real Buddha, a field of blessing that truly increases our merits.

290

Once, Gompawa made a statue of Manjushri, and took it to Venerable Atisha, and asked Atisha: "Is this statue well made? If it is bad, I can take it back." Venerable Atisha replied. : "There is nothing wrong with the statue of the Supreme Manjusri, but the workmanship of this statue is average." 

After that, he raised the statue of Manjushri respectfully on his head.

We should also respect Buddha statues like Venerable Atisha did. If we don’t respect Buddha statues and comment on Buddha statues and pagodas casually, there will be great sins and heavy retribution.

(2) Respect the Dharma

Accepting and upholding the four verses of the Dharma, or more than one stanza, we should stay away from and eradicate all behaviors that are disrespectful to the Dharma.

For example, buying and selling the scrolls; putting the scrolls on the ground, on a seat, under the armpits, placing them in dusty or places where they can be easily knocked over, or putting them together with shoes and socks, or stepping over the scrolls, etc.

In Buddhist scriptures and dharma books, apart from the Hada for making offerings, nothing else can be placed on top of them, not even images of Buddha.

When the Buddha was alive, the Buddha also respected the Dharma and made offerings to the Dharma. In monasteries or Buddhist halls, Buddhist scriptures were placed on the Buddha statues to show respect for the Dharma.

Many of us arbitrarily place Buddhist scriptures and Dharma books, whether intentionally or not, these are acts of disrespect to the Dharma, and will reap the result of diminishing wisdom.

291

Kadampa Dade Sharawa said: 

"I am equal to playing with the Dharma and doing everything, 

but those who disrespect the Dharma and the Dharma teachers are the cause of bad wisdom..." 

This means that often we don't think about things related to Buddhism and Dharma. We are very casual and careless, but in the final analysis, disrespect for the Dharma and disrespect for the guru and is the main cause of bad wisdom.

(3) All monks should be treated equally in respect of the Sangha Treasures, and should be treated equally without distinction.

To the Sangha or the monks, or the ascetic who only has the image of a monk, or the pictures and photos of the monks, do not ridicule, criticize, point at or make comments about them, since the consequences of disrespecting the Sangha are very heavy.

According to the Sutra of Boundless Life and Wisdom, even if we despise a bhikkhu with a very poor foundation, there will be no liberation for a kalpa.

And such bhikkhus, if they practice according to the Three Ways, can gradually master the teachings, and finally attain the supreme Bodhi.

Therefore, no monks can be taken lightly.

Some people casually comment on the monks' appearance and behavior, and say many things without thinking about it, and unintentionally plant evil seeds. This should be noted.

In the past, the Kadampa master Dromtonpa and the great yogi Shayrawa saw what looked like a broken yellow cloth on a monk's robe on the road. They dared not step on it. These are what we should learn.

292

In addition, the "King of Samadhi  Sutra" says: 

"Whatever karma they create

The corresponding result will come to them." 

The Three Jewels are the most profound merit fields in the world. Therefore, the more you respect the Three Jewels, the more you will feel the respect of all beings for you and gain the respect of others.

(2) Practice after taking refuge in the Three Jewels

After taking refuge in the Three Jewels after thinking about the merits and practicing the Dharma, you should always think about the difference in the merits of the Three Jewels and remember them one by one.

Including the difference between the Three Jewels and other religions, the difference between the Three Jewels; the difference between the merits of the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Sangha, and the differences in the merits of the Three Jewels that are superior to those of other religions.

The point is to be very clear about each difference or merit, and to think about it continuously.

Only by constantly remembering the merits of the Three Jewels and constantly cultivating our heart of taking refuge will our faith in the Three Jewels become stronger and stronger.

Offering to the Three Jewels Practice Method 

293

(1) What are the merits of making offerings to the Three Jewels? 

According to the more extensive explanations in the scriptures, for Buddha statues or Buddha's relics, even with a bouquet of flowers, one can feel the fruit of Nirvana.

The "Guanyin Sutra" says: 

"Making offerings to countless Buddhas in person in the past is not as great as making offerings to a Buddha statue in the last days."

The sutra also says: 

He will offer them various flowers, necklaces, fragrant ointments, scented powders, burning incense, canopies, flags, and banners.

Incense, flowers, lamps, paints, bells, music, umbrellas, covers, banners, and flags, each of which has ten kinds of merit.

For example, by offering flowers, you can feel that the world where the practitioner will be born in the next life is as beautiful as a flower, with a strong body, extraordinary aura, beautiful skin color, and a strange fragrance on the body, and there will be no shortage of wealth.

In short, when making offerings to the Buddha, whichever one of the six Buddha faculties you make offerings to, you will feel that your corresponding faculties are clean, bright, peaceful and wonderful.

It is also said in the sutra that if you offer anything with sincerity, you can feel the fruit of becoming a Buddha.

The book written by Songtsan Gampo, the Tibetan king, describes the merits of making offerings to Buddha statues by citing the words of Manjusri Bodhisattva asking Buddha. 

Manjusri Bodhisattva asked: 

After Buddha enters Nirvana, what are the blessing fields for all living beings.

The Buddha replied: 

Bhikkhus and Upas, all of you must be aware that after I enter Nirvana, the offering of my body and image is no different from the field of merit and blessing that is presently offered to me.

There is no reason for things to be different.

Only when a Buddha comes into the world can there be a Buddha image.

Although it is a body image, it is my incarnation.

That is to say, following the Buddha's Parinirvana, making offerings to the Buddha's image is no different from the merits of making offerings to the Buddha's body when the Buddha was alive.

##### (2) The kindness of the Three Jewels

After taking refuge in the Three Jewels, you should think about the kindness of the Three Jewels more, and make offerings to the Three Jewels at all times with the attitude of repaying kindness.

One is to be grateful to the Three Jewels, and the other is to accumulate the merits of liberation and Buddhahood for oneself.

When eating every day, it is best to remember the kindness of the three Jewels before eating, and recite "Om Ah Hum" three times, and offer the food on the table to the Three Jewels.

Sometimes when everyone eats together. If it is inappropriate to speak aloud with your palms together, you can recite it silently.

In this way, eating is originally a consumption of blessings, but after making offerings, it will increase the blessings.

##### (3) Make offerings continuously. 

You also need to persevere in making offerings, especially when you are not very good at making offerings, or the offerings are relatively poor.

When the Kadampa Dade Pu-chung-wa made offerings to the Three Jewels, they could only offer spicy herbs at first, but gradually they were able to offer synthetic long incense, and later they were able to offer precious agarwood.

Pu-chung-wa said, "First I gave sod incense with a sharp odor. Next I obtained sweet-smelling, long sticks of incense made from four substances to give. Now I give aromatic akaru, turuska, and the like."

295

It is said that later Master Buton Rinchen Drub used 22 taels of gold incense every time he prepared incense.

We all have to learn from Master Pu-chung-wa. Even if the offerings are few and bad, as long as we persist in making offerings, we can gradually increase the blessings, get better offerings, and ultimately accumulate great merit.

If you feel that the offerings are not good and don’t make them, you will not be able to accumulate vast blessings, and you will only be a person with low blessings after rebirth.

##### (4) Initiation and devotion when making offerings

When making offerings, you should also pay attention to the Initiation and the devotion.

The heart must be good and broad.

There must be strong confidence in the Three Jewels, and joy from the heart.

After making offerings with such an attitude, dedicate the merits and virtues to the supreme Bodhi, not to attain the fruit of man, heaven and Theravada, let alone to focus on worldly affairs, that is, to dedicate to the vastness.

In the "Sutra of Judgment by King Ajatashi", there is a story about a poor girl who gave a lamp and received the prophecy of the Buddha. It shows that even if the offerings are small, but with great intentions, they can still get great results.

One day, when the Buddha was in the Qijaburi Mountain in the country of Luoyueqi, King Ajatashatru invited the Buddha to have a meal. After the meal, the Buddha returned to the Jihuan Jingshe, and the famous doctor, the old woman, suggested lighting a lamp to offer it to the Buddha.

296

Therefore, King Ajatashatru ordered ten thousand oil lamps to be lit from the gate of the palace to the Jihuan Jingshe where the Buddha lived. It was continuous and very spectacular.

At that time, there was a poor girl named Muni. Although she always wanted to make offerings to the Buddha, she was suffering from lack of money.

Using a copper coin from begging, he lit a small oil lamp in front of the Buddha.

The Muni girl knew that the lamp would be extinguished in the middle of the night, so she reverently made a vow to the Buddha: 

"I wish to be able to do Buddhist deeds in all my lifetimes, and I ask the Buddha to bless this lamp that it will not burn out all night."

After dawn, the Buddha asked the Venerable Muggallana to put out the oil lamp.

The Venerable Muggallana went to the lamp of the Muni girl, and tried to put it out three times, but the lamp could not be extinguished. After it was finally snuffed out, the light still shone into the sky, illuminating the three thousand worlds.

After seeing this, the Buddha said:

"This is the light of a future Buddha. The faith of the Muni girl has eliminated countless kalpas of sin and karma. After another thirty kalpas, her merits and virtues will be perfect, and she should be able to become a Buddha. The sun and the moon are needed, the people are full of great light, and the treasures in the palace are illuminated by the light, like the sky.”

When the Muni girl heard the Buddha's prophecy, she rejoiced in her heart and bowed to the Buddha.

After hearing this, King Ajatashatru asked the old woman, "I have done a lot of meritorious deeds, and the Muni girl only lit a lamp, but she received a prophecy from the Buddha. What is the reason?"

297

The old woman replied: 

"Although the great king has done many things, his heart is different. The Muni girl has devoted herself to the Buddha and because of her vows and devotions, and her heart has already connected to the boundless Dharma.

Because of her sincerity, the poor girl Muni only lit a lamp and received the prophecy of the Buddha, so she should become a Buddha.

From this, it can be seen that the scale of merit does not depend on how much you do, but only on whether your intention is sincere and broad!

After educating others to take refuge in the Three Jewels, you already know the merits and benefits of taking refuge. In order to benefit other beings, out of compassion, you should educate others to enter Buddhism and take refuge in the Three Jewels.
Do it as you can, and let it flow.

Before doing anything by relying on the practice of the Three Jewels, you must pray for the blessings of the Three Jewels, which will gradually increase your confidence in the Three Jewels.

For example, it is easy to succeed by making offerings to the seven branches before doing things, and then praying to the Three Jewels.

Wherever you want to go, you must first bow three times in front of the Buddha statue, and then pray, so that wherever you go, it will be very auspicious.

298

The same is true for the lamas in the monastery. When they go far away, they should go to the Great Sutra Hall of Tuo Le Monastery first. After offering lamps, they make three bows, and then make seven offerings, offer mantras, and pray for a while before leaving. It will go smoothly.

In this way, not only will one's wishes come true, but it will also gradually strengthen the confidence in the Three Jewels, laying a solid foundation for future study.

The practice method of contemplating the benefits of taking refuge 

In-depth contemplation of the eight merits and benefits of taking refuge are mentioned later, and persisting in practicing the Four Refuges every day will also greatly increase the confidence in the guru and the Three Jewels.

Vows to never give up the practice of taking refuge in the Three Jewels 

When we thoroughly understand the causes of taking refuge, the merits and benefits of taking refuge, and the various damages of not taking refuge in the guru and the Three Jewels in this life and the next life, we should never give up whatever happens in our hearts. Thoughts of the Three Jewels, and always make vows: as small as joking, as large as losing one's life, and never say anything about giving up and taking refuge.

299

#### (3) The merits and benefits of taking refuge

##### 1. Truly entering the Dharma door

Only after truly entering Buddhism and taking refuge are we Buddhists, the disciples of the Three Jewels, and those who truly enter Buddhism.
That is to say, from the moment of taking refuge in the Three Jewels, it is possible to begin to receive the blessings of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas.

The blessings of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas originally illuminated the earth like the sun, but before taking refuge, it was as if the mind was hiding in a hole, and the sunshine of the blessings of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas could not shine.

##### 2. Ability to obtain the foundation and merit of good precepts

The root of the precepts is to take refuge, and only after taking refuge can one receive the precepts.

If there is only the thought of ​​taking refuge, but there is no real refuge, then even the five relatively basic precepts cannot be upheld, much less the merits of keeping the precepts.

The foundation of the precept of non-liberation is also taking refuge. If there is no refuge, the merits and virtues of vows of non-liberation, bodhisattva vows, and tantric vows cannot arise.


##### 3. The merits of eliminating karma

After taking refuge, negative karma will be reduced every day.

300

After taking refuge, you become a Buddhist practioner. You will continue to receive the blessings of the Three Jewels of the Guru, and the blessings of Buddhas, Bodhisattvas, and Dharma Protectors. You will constantly reduce karmic obstacles. Even if you recite the Buddha’s name of Buddha Shakyamuni once, you can eliminate tens of thousands of kalpas of karmic debt.


##### 4. Produce infinite blessings

After taking refuge in the Three Jewels, the merits and virtues of the Three Jewels are immeasurable, and the blessings obtained are also inconceivable, resulting in immeasurable merit.

In the The Noble Great Vehicle Sūtra “The Perfection of Generosity” it says:

>
>If the merit of going for refuge took form,
>
>Even these three realms would be too small to
contain it— 
>
>A cupped hand cannot measure 
>
>The great ocean, the storehouse of water.
>

That is to say, if the merit obtained after taking refuge were to take concrete form, then the space of the three realms cannot hold it. 

The three realms refer to the desire realm, the form realm, and the formless realm.

From this we can see how great the merit is after taking refuge.

The Buddha is the most extraordinary field of blessing. The root of goodness planted with the Buddha as the object, even if the original intention and motivation are not pure, will become the cause of liberation and of becoming a Buddha.

The Buddha said in the Scripture of the White Lotus of Compassion:

Ananda! 

As for the good roots born of the Buddha, they will attain the fruit of Nirvana even if they do not want them. 

I say that they will eventually attain Nirvana. 

In this way, the Buddha, World-Honored One, is born with a single thought, 

and the fruit of all their good roots is Nirvana,

and I say that they will eventually attain Nirvana. "

301

Here the Buddha said to Venerable Ananda that by the seeds of goodness planted by the Buddha, even if you didn't want to attain Nirvana in the first place, you will definitely achieve Nirvana eventually.

Therefore, once you have taken refuge, when making offerings to Buddhas and Bodhisattvas, or after reciting sutras and practicing the Dharma, when devotion is made, the devotion is weak and unfinished, merits and blessings will not circulate freely, and will eventually return to Buddhahood.

For example, in the past, a man in India made offerings to thousands of monks, but after making offerings, he did not know how make the dedication. He saw a beautiful elephant in front of him. In India at that time, elephants were very respected animals, and he thought, I will make a wish to become an elephant in my next life.

As a result, after his death, because of the great blessings he offered to thousands of monks, he became the throne of Emperor Shitian, a three-headed incense elephant.

This is an example of wrong apiration, but, even so, the virtuous offering of lamps will eventually liberate him to become a Buddha.

Our usual aspiration is "I dedicate all merits and virtues to the six realms so that sentient beings can be free from suffering and attain happiness." 

This is a very good aspiration. All living beings in the six realms are freed from suffering and attain happiness, including both family members and ourselves. It is very extraordinary.

Don't be afraid if the aspiration is wrong, even if the offering will lead to the wrong place. After taking refuge, because of the merit of taking refuge, the blessing will still return to the ultimate aspiration of becoming a Buddha and attaining enlightenment.

302
##### 5. Prevent falling into evil realms

If you truly take refuge to prevent falling into the lower realms, the karma of falling into the three lower realms will naturally be eliminated.
If you don’t do bad things after taking refuge, you will definitely be reborn in the Pure Land or get the fruits of the world and the gods with the blessing of the Guru’s Three Jewels.

##### 6. Prevent disturbance by demons

After taking refuge without to prevent disturbance by demons, you will not be obstructed by ghosts and demons. Just by reciting the four refuges they will run away. The power of the four refuges is very extraordinary.


Among the Four Refuges, one sentence of taking refuge in the guru means taking refuge in the lineage masters of all dynasties starting from Buddha Shakyamuni, up to your own root guru.

For example, in our lineage, from Buddha Shakyamuni to the present, there are a total of forty-six generations. One recitation of "In the guru I take refuge" means taking refuge in forty-six masters, including the Buddha. Many Buddhas and Bodhisattvas.

Similarly, taking refuge in a Buddha does not mean taking refuge in one or two Buddhas, but taking refuge in all the Buddhas of the ten directions and three times, including a certain Buddha who has a deep relationship with us.

Taking refuge in the Dharma means taking refuge in 84,000 dharmas, including all the teachings and dharmas handed down by the Buddha.

Taking refuge in the Sangha means taking refuge in all the bodhisattvas and arhats from the first to the tenth levels (bhumis), as well as the transcendent Dharma protectors, who naturally include the Bodhisattvas and Dharma protectors who have a special predestined relationship with us.

303

As soon as we recite the Four Refuges, the Three Jewels will come to rescue us. Those Buddhas, Bodhisattvas and Dharma protectors with whom we have a karmic relationship will come in an instant because.

So, after taking refuge, you will be protected by all these gurus, Buddhas, Bodhisattvas, and Dharma protectors, and you will not suffer any harm.


##### 7. Granting of wishes

After taking refuge, if you always sincerely respect the Three Jewels and ask for their blessings, you can easily succeed in doing things.

Although the degree of confidence is different and the blessings produced are different, the blessings will gradually increase, and doing things will become more and more easy. Therefore, the greatest method of accumulating blessings is to recite the Four Refugees.

The Buddha said in the "The Vast Game Sutra": 

"A person who is blessed can achieve anything."

Venerable Milarepa's reincarnation, Kadampa's great virtue Pabongka Rinpoche also said: 

"If you have an ordinary mind of taking refuge, 

you will first be rewarded in this life, 

everything will be accomplished, 

and then you will receive auspicious signs when you are dying."

##### 8. Accelerated Achievement 

304

Before taking refuge, all aspects of practice are much worse than after taking refuge. Not to mention, in terms of accumulating merit and eliminating karma the difference is like day and night. Therefore, after taking refuge, the achievement of studies will be faster.

For the practice of the Four Refuges, please refer to Treasures of the Dharma Sea Book 2.

305

#### Section 4 - Karma (Cause and Effect)

Having taken refuge in the Three Jewels of the Guru, although you will no longer fall into the three evil realms, you still need to respect cause and effect.

If you don’t respect cause and effect, and don’t know how to restrain yourself, and you will create karma indiscriminately, and you will still suffer in the three evil realms.

We usually feel that we have studied Buddhism, and we have taken refuge in the Three Jewels of the Guru, and regularly recite the sutras, and can keep any vows we have made.

We feel that we haven't done too many  bad things, we seem to be far away from the evil realms, and we don't worry much about falling into the evil realms.

In fact, this is just an appearance that arises because you do not understand cause and effect, do not understand the essential characteristics of karma, and are not good at observing and thinking.

Whether or not we fall into the evil path is not up to us, but is determined by our accumulated karma.

Our countless past lives have created immeasurable karma, but we don't realize it.

At the time of death, whichever power of good or evil karma is stronger will be triggered by love and grasping among the twelve Twelve links of dependent origination, and then the karmic retribution will flow.

We feel that we haven’t done many bad deeds in this life, but if the big bad karma we created in the previous life matured in this life, or the small bad karma has grown into a big bad karma, what should we do?

The scale of karma, on the one hand, has something to do with the strength of the intention, conditions, and results of the karma.

Therefore, what we think of as a small evil can actually become a very large evil karma.

306

For example, speaking abusively to another. If you hold it in for a long time before speaking out, you can't hold it anymore, and finally you explode, or for some other reason, you are very angry and lose your temper. After you have finished, you feel very comfortable again, and feel that the scolding was right.

In this case, the motives, intention, and results of this scolding were all done very "satisfactorily".

Even a simple phrase like "Get lost!", produces a lot of negative karma.

As another example, there is a mosquito that keeps you awake. You searched for a long time and couldn’t find it. You get very annoyed. Once you have found it and squashed it, you can sleep."

The karma of killing a living being is likely to send us to hell just because of a tiny mosquito.

On the other hand, the creation of wholesome karma is not as great as we think.

We always feel that we are not bad. It seems that we have done many good deeds, such as releasing living beings, making offerings to the Three Jewels, reciting scriptures, etc. We feel that we have a good store of positive karma, but it is not necessarily true.

If you want to create good karma, in addition to continuing to do good deeds, you must also purify and perfect your intentions, right actions, and devotions every time you do good deeds, so that the accumulated good karma will be great.

307

Now think about our intentions when we do good deeds, compared to the Bodhicitta aspiration of the Bodhisattvas to save all sentient beings, or the renunciation of the solitary buddhas who are disgusted with samsara, or even the sravakas grasp of the impermanence of life.
We have none of those.

The first thing that comes to our mind is usually to hope for wealth, peace, etc. in this life, or to say "devotion to the Great Bodhi", but in our mind we still hope to be rich in this life, all of which are covetous for the happiness of this life. Compared to the aspiration for Liberation, these petty wishes are useless.

The "Secret Continuation" says: 

---

"Don't be greedy for the results of this life. 

If you only pin your hopes on this life, 

it will not benefit the next life, 

but if you hope for the consummation of the next life, 

the results of this life will be extensive and abundant."

---

Master Dromtonpa asked Venerable Atisha: 

"If you act for the sake of happiness, benefit, and respect in this life, what is the result of it?"

The Venerable Atisha replied: 

"The reward is to get that."

Then he asked, 

"What about the future?"

The Venerable Atisha said: 

"Hell, hungry ghosts, beasts!"

The Venerable Atisha also said, like plants, if the root is poisonous, the branches and leaves are poisonous, and if the root is medicine, the branches and leaves are also medicine.

Therefore, anything that arises from thoughts such as greed, hatred, and delusion in the heart is evil karma, and it is the cause of evil. This is aspect of the intention.

The same goes for initiation and dedication of merit.

When we perform good deeds, most of the time we are not very pure.

For example, one is lazy when studying, and when chanting sutras, one is either dozing off or being distracted.

At the end of the practice, the dedication of the aspiration is similar to that of the intention, both of which are to fulfill the wishes of this life.

Therefore, we think that we have generated a lot of merit, but it is not necessarily so.

In this way, for the sake of future rebirths, it is not enough to just ask the Three Jewels for help. You must also listen to the teachings of the Guru and the Three Jewels and do what they say.

In the Collection of Judgments and Sentences it says:

--- 

The Buddhas do not wash off sins with water, 

nor do they remove all sufferings with their hands.

Unless you transfer the blame to him, 

the truth of the Dharma will lead to liberation.

---

It means that the Buddha's compassion is the greatest. If the Buddha could wash away our sins and obstacles with water, or he can rescue us from samsara with his hands, or if the Buddha can give us his fruits, then the Buddha would have done this a long time ago, so we don't have to suffer from samsara.

But these are not feasible, the Buddha can only liberate us by teaching the scriptures to us.

Therefore, we must realize that: in order not to fall into the evil path, we must take refuge in the Three Jewels of the Guru; after taking refuge, we must follow the teachings in order to be completely liberated; liberation is the friut, and we must eliminate bad karma; in order not to create evil karma, we must deeply believe in cause and effect, we must understand the essential characteristics of karma, so we must learn the law of cause and effect.

1. Recognize cause and effect.

Everything has a cause and an effect.

For example, being able to have a cup of water to drink is because of the blessing of drinking this cup of water, this is the cause.

When someone is scolded or beaten, it is because of their own bad karma in the past. The person who beats and scolds them is karma, and being beaten and scolded is the result.

To respect cause and effect, we must recognize cause and effect, and we must recognize karma.

It is necessary to recognize the four aspects of karma: the inevitability of karma, strong proliferation, non-retribution, and indestructibility.

Object, intention, action, completion

Cause, intention, action, result

##### (1) The inevitability of karmic retribution 

Nagarjuna Bodhisattva said in the "Bao Ga Lun":

---

Unwholesome feelings, 

all sufferings, like these evil realms;

Feeling all pleasures, 

all living beings are happy.

---

The general law of cause and effect is that good karma leads to happiness, and bad karma leads to suffering.

310

Although the operation of cause and effect is extremely subtle, there is no confusion at all.

What is the inevitability of karma? The inevitability of karma is: 

Good will be rewarded with good, evil will be rewarded with evil, and the results of good and evil will not be wrong.

If you plant beans, you will never produce wheat; if you plant wheat, you will produce wheat, but you will never produce beans; if you plant poison, you will reap poison, and if you plant medicine, you will reap medicine.

Whatever seed is sown, that kind of fruit is produced.

This is very important: Whatever seed is sown, that kind of fruit is produced.

For example, if we respect others, others will respect us; if we scold others, they will scold us in turn.

Giving will bring wealth; releasing life will bring longevity, because releasing life is to save the lives of other beings, so the result will be longevity; killing life, our lives will be short-lived, because killing will damage the lives of other beings; stealing will definitely lead to poverty; Provocation will lead to alienation by relatives and friends.

Once you understand the inevitability of karma, you will naturally understand many causal phenomena.

You will understand that your pain is the result of your previous actions.

Therefore, we must face it calmly, and not generate hatred and cause greater evil effects.

311

##### (2) Strong proliferation of karma 

There are six aspects of strong proliferation of karma: strong proliferation of the essence of karma, strong proliferation of intentional consciousness, strong proliferation of karmic objects, and strong proliferation of karma maker's identity, the strong proliferation of karma over time, and the strong proliferation of individual good deeds.

The strong proliferative nature of the essence of karma 

The strong proliferative nature of the essence of karma is: even a small bad deed, when the retribution comes out, it will grow to a great size, and can harm a person for life after life; a small good karma Karma, when the good fruits appear, the blessings will be immeasurable and boundless.


This is the general law of the nature of cause and effect, just like a small fire that starts will eventually burn down the entire forest.

For example, when the Buddha was alive, King Ashoka's in a previous life was still a child of an ordinary family.

One day, the Buddha and Venerable Ananda met this child on the road. He was very happy when he saw the Buddha, but he had nothing to give, so he grabbed a handful of soil on the ground and offered it to Shakyamuni Buddha as food.

The Buddha said to Venerable Ananda, 

"Put this soil back in a bowl and apply it to the wall of the lonely garden. 

This child will be a king who will rule the world in the future."

312

Later, as the Buddha said, more than two hundred years after the Buddha's passing, King Ashoka was born and unified India. In the later period of his rule, he spread Buddhism widely and built 84,000 Buddha stupas.

A child just offered a handful of soil to the Buddha, and for such a small act of kindness, the result was that he grew to become a king.

Therefore, good karma is inherently highly proliferative.

Negative karma also grows substantially in nature.

Nagarjuna lived for 600 years. When Nagarjuna was more than 400 years old, there was a king in India called King Lexing, who often did things for Nagarjuna.

He vowed: 

"However long Nagarjuna Bodhisattva's lifespan is, my lifespan will be juust as long, and on the day Nagarjuna Bodhisattva passes away, I will also die."

He made a vow to never leave my teacher, and after he made this vow, King Lexing lived for more than a hundred years before he died.

At that time, Nagarjuna Bodhisattva took many precious classics from the Dragon Palace, spread Buddhism widely, and the Buddhadharma became more and more prosperous in the world. The Demon King Bo Xun was extremely uneasy and wanted to destroy the Buddhadharma, so he was reborn as Prince Guli, the son of King Lexing. In order to gain the throne, he waited every day for his father to die.

However, no matter what he did, the king would not die.

Later, his mother said to him: 

"Your father vowed to protect Nagarjuna Bodhisattva and live as long as Nagarjuna Bodhisattva. If Nagarjuna Bodhisattva were to pass away, your father would die.

"The prince went to Nagarjuna Bodhisattva and said that he had unfortunately suffered from a disease that requires a human brain to heal, and asked the Bodhisattva to give his head.

313

Nagarjuna Bodhisattva naturally understood the reason for this, but he thought: 

"The Buddha gave his body countless times in the past, and now I am in such a situation. In order to save all sentient beings, I should also fulfill this request." So he accepted.

So the prince swung his sword and tried to chop off Nagarjuna's head, but it was like cutting the air, and he couldn't hurt Nagarjuna at all. Nagarjuna told him, "I have completely purified the consequences of weapon damage five hundred lifetimes ago, so weapons cannot hurt me.

However, when I was still an ordinary person, I once mowed auspicious grass and saw a lot of small insects in the grass. I mowed the grass without caring and killed a lot of insects, but the retribution has not yet manifest.

If you gently scratch my neck with auspicious grass, I will pass away."

When the prince heard this, he did as Nagarjuna Bodhisattva said, and cut off the bodhisattva's head with auspicious grass. Nagarjuna Bodhisattva passed away and was reborn in the Land of Ultimate Bliss.

Prince Guli was worried that Nagarjuna Bodhisattva's body would come back to life, so he threw the Bodhisattva's head a lonng way away.

Since Nagarjuna Bodhisattva has gained freedom from earth, water, fire, and wind, his body and head turned into two large stones.

The amazing thing is that the distance between the two stones is closing step by step. When they are closed, Nagarjuna Bodhisattva will re-enter this body and once again promote the Mahayana Middle Way.

314

The strong proliferative nature of karma is so powerful.

In past lives, Nagarjuna Bodhisattva only killed a few small insects, and because he did not repent of this small karma, it brought about such a tremendous result.

Although he is a bodhisattva of high rank, he passed away because of his previous actions. This is the strong multiplication of the essence of karma.

It shows how terrible the growth of bad karma is.

The strong proliferative nature of the mind-generating consciousness depends on the subjective consciousness. The karma-generating mind or motives are different, and the results are also very different.

If you do a little thing with compassion and bodhicitta, the reward will be very, very great. This is good karma. If you do a little thing with great anger, hatred, greed, and delusion, the retribution will be very large in the future. Bad karma.

In terms of motivation, the growth of good and evil karma is the same.

So it's important to have a heart! This is the strong proliferative nature of the mind-consciousness.

For example, killing a small ant with great greed, hatred and delusion will also be a huge karma.

On the contrary, if there is no greed, hatred, and delusion, even if you accidentally kill a person, it is not a big karma.

For example, there was a mother and her son. The mother was working outside the yard, and the son was in the yard. The son did not know that his mother was on the other side of the wall, and threw a stone, which happened to hit his mother's head, killing her.

315

This son had feelings of greed, hatred or delusion, no bad motives or thoughts, so his is a very small karma.

The same is true for the size of the heart.

Giving a dollar to the poor with bodhicitta, the future reward will be inconceivable, and it may increase to tens of millions or hundreds of millions.

The size of the highly proliferative result of the object of karma depends on the karma object.
If the object of karma is one's mentor, parents, or Buddha or Bodhisattva, these are all benefactors.

Parents are the benefactors who nurture us, and teachers, Buddhas and Bodhisattvas are the benefactors who rescue us from samsara, from suffering and attainment of happiness.

If you do good deeds to these objects, the good reward will be great; if you do evil deeds, the evil retribution will be great.

This is the strong proliferation of the objects of karma.

The strong proliferative nature of the identity of the actor 

Sometimes, the identities of the actors are different, and the size of the retribution is also different.
Those who have not received ordination, such as those who have just taken refuge but have not yet received ordination, are compared with those who have taken the five precepts. Those who take the five precepts create a little bad karma, and the karma will be very large; on the contrary, if they create a little good karma, the effect is also very big.

316

The retribution of karma is different, and the retribution of those who are ordained is even greater.

Among those who are ordained, the results are also different.

A person who takes the novice vows, even if he does a little bit of bad karma, will get more bad karma than a person who has not taken the five vows. Similarly, if he does a little bit of good karma, the good karma will be greater than those who have not taken the five precepts.

By analogy, those who take ordination are greater than those who take the novice vows, those who take the bodhisattva vows are greater than those who take the monk ordination, and those who take the tantric vows are greater than those who take the bodhisattva vows.

Ordinary people offer tens of thousands of oil lamps to the Buddha, which is not as great as a pure bhikkhu offering a single oil lamp.

Conversely, the sin of a precept-keeping monk killing an ant with hatred is greater than the sin of an ordinary person killing a human being.

The identities of the actors are different, and the scale of the results is also different.

Different identities have different strong proliferation of karma, and this is the strong proliferation of karma creators.

The strong proliferative nature of karma over time is divided into two parts here.
317

(1) The strong proliferative property of karma over time refers to the proliferative property of the results according to the duration of the karma time.

This is easy to understand. Whether it is good karma or bad karma, long-term and continuous karma will definitely result in greater rewards than short-term karma.

(2) Special dates whic contribute to the strong proliferative nature of karma. 

Compared with normal karma, the increase in the results of karma on certain dates is different.

The karma created in ordinary time is different from the karma created in the first and fifteenth day of the new year.

Especially on the fifteenth day, if you kill a living being on the fifteenth day, even if you kill one ant, the karma is the same as killing hundreds of ants.

In addition, the first day of each month is the beginning of the origin of the month. If the origin of the first day of the new year is not good, the whole month will not be very good;

And some other special days:

The day of the Buddha's transformation is from the first to the fifteenth day of the first lunar month.

The Buddha's birthday is on the eighth day of April.

The auspicious day of the Buddha is from the eighth to the fifteenth day of April and the fifteenth day of every month.

The Buddha's reincarnation day, enlightenment day, and death day are April 15th.

The Buddha comes from the thirty-three days on September twenty-two.

On the fourth day of the sixth month, the day when the Buddha first turned the Wheel of Dharma.

The second day of the Buddha turning the Wheel of Dharma is the fifteenth day of the third month.

Tsongkhapa was born and passed away on the twenty-fifth of October.

The auspicious day of the Medicine Buddha is the eighth day of every month.

The auspicious days of the Dakini Buddha are on the tenth and twenty-fifth of each month.

The auspicious day of Amitabha Buddha is on the 30th of every month.

...

In general, these are auspicious days, and on these special days, the results of karma are greater than on normal days.

If you do evil, the reward for evil will be great; if you do good, the reward for good will be great.

The strong proliferation of individual good dharmas, some good dharmas have some unique laws, and we must understand and master them.

(1) Strong proliferation in a special period 

In the age of the end of the Dharma, the merits of taking a certain precept and keeping it for one day are far better than the merits of keeping the whole precepts and keeping the precepts for a long time in the age of perfection.

(2) Strong proliferation in special regions 

319

In the Saha world of the age of the end of the Dharma, the merits and virtues of practicing good deeds for a moment are far better than the merits and virtues of practicing good deeds in the pure land of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas for many kalpas.

We are now in the Saha world at the end of the Dharma age.

(3) The strong proliferation of special methods 

In the secret method, there are many convenient methods that can increase merit.

For example, in daily recitation, if you recite the mantra for increasing merit seven times every morning, the merit of that day can be increased by tens of thousands of times.

Recite the rosary blessing mantra seven times, then blowing on the rosary, and reciting the rosary once is equivalent to reciting it a hundred times.

Tantra also has special practice methods such as the blessing of speech, and the merits increase even more.

After reciting the blessing, recite the mantra again, and reciting it once is equivalent to reciting it tens of thousands of times; even ordinary conversations will have some merits, and there will be no great retribution when talking about right and wrong.

Merit increasing mantras and blessings are all special ways to increase merit.

The above is the strong proliferation of individual good dharmas.

(3) Infallibility of karmic retribution 

If you do not do evil karma, you will not have bad retribution, and if you do not do good karma, you will not have good retribution.

Likewise, there will be no wealth without giving, and there will be no cause for health and longevity without release.

320

"Infallibility of karmic retribution" also reminds us that we must be diligent in studying Buddhism.

Although there will be no evil retribution if we do not do evil karma, who will give us a reward if we do not do good karma? 

Patriarchs and great virtues are achieved only through hard practice, and nothing is gained for nothing.

If you don’t work hard, no matter how many blessings Buddhas and Bodhisattvas send, it’s useless. If enlightenment could be given, the Buddha would have given it to all sentient beings long ago.

Therefore, one should diligently practice and sow good causes, so as to reap the corresponding rewards.

(4) The incorrupt nature of doing karma means that the evil karma that has been done will not be eliminated on its own.

Evil karma must be eliminated through repentance and chanting scriptures. Otherwise, the karma will not disappear on its own unless the karma ripens and the karma ends.

The same is true of good karma. If you do good deeds, if there is no anger or jealousy, the good karma will not disappear.

Then, what kind of state is the indestructable nature of karma?

In the Buddhist scriptures on the "retribution of birth and fruit of fate", it says:

---

The karma created by sentient beings will not be destroyed for a hundred kalpas.

---

That is to say, the good and bad karma we create will not be destroyed even after a hundred kalpas, until the karma is worked out, the result will appear.

The combination of karma will bring forth the result.

Good and evil karma is the cause; karma are the conditions that are conducive to the maturity of the cause and the resultant result, such as a specific person, thing, environment, condition, etc.

When planting wheat, the seed is the cause; soil, watering, and spreading fertilizer are the primary and secondary factors.

We all know that seeds must be planted in order to germinate. If the seeds are not planted in the soil, or if they are planted, but not watered, fertilized, or sprayed, the seeds will either not germinate, or will not bear fruit.

The same is true of karma. If there is no condition, the cause will not ripen. When the condition arises, the cause and the condition are combined, and the result will arise.

The cause of making a fortune is generosity, and the predestined relationship is to encounter a good business or project.

If there is no cause for giving, even if you encounter a good business or project, it is not necessarily a good thing, it may be a disaster.

Because you don't have the reason to get rich, you shouldn't get this blessing, and you may not be able to afford this fate.

Therefore, it is necessary to create more good causes in order to form good karma.

In addition, people who do not have good fortune will ask questions even if they make money. For example, if someone makes money and they have a car accident.

question.

Therefore, you should always do good deeds, accumulate more and more merit. In this way, whatever kind of fate you encounter is a good thing, and you can bear it.

The reason for good health is to recite sutras well, to release animals frequently, and not to kill.

The effect is to take medicine, see a doctor in time, and pay more attention in life.

If there is no healthy cause, and your health is not good, no matter how good the doctor is, they may not be able to cure you.

The good and bad karma created by the continuous circulation of predestination has not yet arrived. Those who hold a mind-only view believe that it is hidden in the alaya consciousness and will not disappear on its own, but will always wait for the appearance of karma.

The Madhyamika school believes that the nature of karma is that it is not corrupt, that it is not preserved in the alaya consciousness, and that it cannot be destroyed.

Candrakīrti Bodhisattva said in "Entering the Middle Way":

The self-nature of causation is not inherently corrupt, 

and it is possible to do it without relying on store-consciousness. 

Some karma has been destroyed over many lifetimes, 

and its consequences will still be produced.

--- 

It means that even if the big karma is destroyed, the small karma remains, after many rebirths, the retribution will still appear.

323

No matter how good or bad the karma is, it will not destroy itself.

We put our palms together in front of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas today. Although it is only a small gesture, no matter how many times we are reborn, as long as the condition is met, the result of liberation will be ripe.

There is a way to delay the appearance of bad karma, which is to prevent the growth of bad karma, so as to prolong the germination of the seeds of bad karma and produce results.

It's like putting a seed in a dry place and blocking the connection between water and soil, it won't germinate.

For example, the cause of health is to save the lives of all sentient beings, so we release more animals and help a variety of good causes.

However, we don’t know how much killing we have done before. Therefore, in order to delay the evil retribution of illness, we must pay more attention to the conditions that affect our health while planting good causes.

For example, do not eat unclean things, do not go to disease-prone areas, and do not go to places where the soil and water are unacceptable. Take medicine when it is time to take medicine.

Be careful about what you do and you won't be unhealthy.

Delaying the appearance of evil retribution will prolong the time of repentance, and finally, karma can only be completely eliminated through repentance.

324

2. The Ten Ways of Karma

We have already understood the essential characteristics of karma and the importance of cause and effect, but we still do not necessarily understand what is good karma and what is bad karma, because cause and effect are very subtle, so how do we determine in the future that what you do is good karma? 

According to the "Kusa Lun":

Taking a picture of it is rough, 

good and bad are as appropriate, 

and it is said to be the ten ways of karma.

That is to say, the relatively obvious good and bad karma can be summarized into ten types, called the ten karma paths, including the ten good karma and the ten evil karma.

Since our words and deeds in the world are also included in the ten karma, it is necessary to learn and understand the ten karma.

On the other hand, the "Entrance to the Middle Way" says:

---

If all the different births and all the words are born, 

if all the self-reliance and realization of Bodhi, 

and all the Buddha's sons are determined to win, 

the reason for the increase of the superior birth is not the remainder.

---

The ten good deeds in the ten karma are also called the ten good precepts.

The meaning of this verse is: 

For sentient beings, keeping the ten wholesome precepts is the basis for attaining the perfect human body; for Shravakas and Solitary Arhats, it is the basis for attaining the status of Arhat; for Bodhisattvas, it is the Buddha's foundation.

Therefore, learning the ten ways of karma is very important for correctly understanding things and cause and effect, and preventing evil karma.

325

It is also more conducive to cutting off bad karma, eliminating karmic obstacles, and accumulating merit.

The ten virtuous deeds are: 

no killing, 

no stealing, 

no sexual misconduct, 

no lying, 

no double tongue, 

no evil speech, 

no flattery, 

no greed, 

no hatred, 

and no wrong views.

The opposite of the ten virtuous deeds karma are the ten non-virtuous deeds, which are: killing, stealing, sexual misconduct, lying, gossip, bad speech, flattery, greed, hatred, and wrong views.

(1) The results of the ten non-virtuous deeds

Severe killing means killing arhats, fathers and mothers, and killing; 

moderate killings means killing large animals; 

mild killings means killing small animals.


In addition, there is no difference between letting others kill and committing suicide by yourself, and instigating others to kill is more serious.

It is stated in the Jù shě lùn:

If the military and other colleagues are colleagues, 

they are all like authors.

That is to say, like the military, because they have to obey orders and kill the enemy together, everyone's killing karma is the same, and even if one kills, the others will have the same retribution.

326

Serious killings will lead to hell, moderate killings will lead to the realm of ghosts, and minor killings will lead to being reborn as beasts or animals.

Even after the karma of the three evil realms is completely eradicated, when you reincarnate as a human being, your body will not be healthy and your life will be short.

Or there are strange diseases, or there are intractable diseases at birth, or even death at birth.

Or the body cannot absorb it, no matter what or how you eat, your body will not improve, you will be afflicted with pain, and medicines will not work, until you die painfully. These are the results of killing.

Some people's retribution of killing can be manifested in this world.

For example, after killing some sentient beings, a man soon had a problem and died unexpectedly in a car accident.

Some people say that this is karma disease, but in fact all diseases are karma disease, the result of karma.

For the pain caused by killing, it is necessary to recite more scriptures, repent, and then see a doctor, which may be effective.

The usual practice in Tibetan areas is to recite the scriptures first, or the Great White Umbrella Mantra, or make a thousand offerings to the Medicine Buddha, and then see a doctor. The effect will be obvious.

The effect of killing also depends on the motive at that time.

Different motives bring different results.

Killing is all because of greed, hatred, and delusion, some are because of greed, such as greed for the flesh, skin, horns, bones, etc. of animals; some are because of anger, hatred, and hatred of certain animals; In order to make offerings to certain gods, many cattle and sheep were killed and sacrificed.

327

In general, no matter what the motivation is, the stronger the intention, the heavier the consequences.

Without a motive, whatever leads to the death of sentient beings is not considered killing.

For example, if we don't pay attention when we walk, and we trample ants or bugs to death under our feet, it is not considered killing.

The result of not killing is health and longevity, increased blessings, and increased compassion.

So, from now on, let's stop killing.

If you want to avoid killing, you must first have the idea of ​​releasing life in your heart, and make a vow in your heart: 

"From today, I will treat all beings in the six realms with compassion and not kill any being."

If you do this constantly, your thoughts will gradually change.

The Effect of Stealing: 

Stealing is stealing what belongs to the Lord.
If it is unowned, it is not considered theft.

Serious theft is stealing the property of the Three Treasures, or stealing valuables; moderate theft is stealing from the poor; petty theft is stealing small money, lack of business, and so on.

The result of stealing is poverty, and one will be poor in every life.

328

Stealing cuts off the cause of making a fortune, wisdom, conditions and other aspects are the predestined conditions for making a fortune.

If there is no cause, the cause will not work, so there will be poverty.

For example, even though some people work very hard, have good conditions in all aspects of work, and are wise, they are still very poor and have a hard life. This is probably because there is no cause for getting rich, but only causes of poverty.

It may be that you stole something in a previous life. If you want to make a fortune in this life, you must first repent of your previous karma, and then do wealth and generosity.

For example, making offerings to the Three Jewels, especially making offerings to the Sangha, more than four monks together are called the Sangha, and the blessings they get are very large. By doing so, they will plant the cause of making money, and they will only make money in the future.

Another consequence of stealing is losing money.

Your own things often disappear for no reason, or your money is stolen or defrauded by others.

The number of thieves in the world increases, the harvest of crops will decrease, and disasters such as drought, frost, and hail will often occur. These are the consequences of stealing.

If you don't steal, it will be easier to get richer.

Therefore, not only should we not steal, but we should also give money regularly.

The best almsgiving is to make offerings to the Three Jewels, and then to help those in need, such as through charity and donations.

329

Adultery is the relationship between a man and a woman other than a husband and wife.

Serious adultery will go to hell.

A moderate level of sexual misconduct will fall into the realm of hungry ghosts in future generations. For example, the target of sexual misconduct is someone who has a relationship with him within three generations; or sexual misconduct after marriage; or a husband and wife act in front of a Buddha statue, 

A Buddha statue is not to be placed in the bedroom. This is the reason.

A small amount of licentiousness will lead to rebirth in the realm of beasts.

People who are wicked will consume  blessings quickly, and then gradually they will become ugly, and their bodies will stink; the living environment will be bad and dirty, and there will be a lot of muddy sewage. These are the results of wickedness.

Abstaining from sexual immorality is also called the holy life. Such a person will be very beautiful, the body will naturally emit fragrance, the family will be happy, the husband and wife will be harmonious, and the children will be happy.

It will be very fortunate, and after death, rebirth will almost always be in heaven.

The consequences of false speech is to speak deceitful words with the motive of greed, hatred, and delusion. The object of the speech is a normal person, and the other party can understand and have normal understanding ability.

330

There are many kinds of lies, and the most serious lies are the teaching of the Law of the Supreme Being.

The Dharma of the Master is to falsely claim that one has the merits and virtues above the first jhana, and falsely claim that one has the merits and abilities beyond the world.

For example, if you don’t have the merits of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas at first, but you say that you have such merits, you say that you are a Buddha or Bodhisattva; you don’t have supernatural powers, but you say you have supernatural powers; you are not a living Buddha, but you say that you are a living Buddha; .

These are all big lies, and the result will be rebirth in hell.

A moderate level of lying is to deceive monks, parents, and benefactors.

There are a lot of small lies, including cheating money, deceiving people, etc., and later rebirths will also be in the evil realms.

The result of lying is that there are often liars around, and no one will believe what you say. Even if what you say makes sense, no one will believe it.

They are often wronged. For example, some people who did not commit a crime were framed or even imprisoned. This is the result of lying in a previous life.

Therefore, when we are wronged by others, we must understand that this is a kind of retribution, and think in our hearts: This is the consequence of my previous lies.

When you created karma easily and naturally in the first place, and when the retribution comes out, you should also accept it willingly.

If hatred arises at this time, the results will increase and new negative karma may be created.

331

It is necessary to endure peacefully, and after the retribution is over, the karma will disappear.

The result of not telling lies is that you will be trusted by everyone and praised by others, and you will be very kind.

The consequences of lying is to sow discord.

The more serious duplicity is in the monastery, when talking among the Sangha to instigate dissension, don't underestimate this verbal karma. This kind of karma is very easy to create, so be very careful.

Others sow out the relationship between family members.

For example, saying in front of the master, "Master, this disciple is not sincere and  does not believe in you..." to poison the relationship between the master and the disciple.

Then, he went to the disciple and said, "Your master doesn't care about you, it's not good for you..." to poison the relationship between the disciple and the master.

The consequences of doing so will be tragic, it will lead to the betrayal of relatives and friends, and when you are old, you will be ignored, your own children will not take care of you, and you will die alone.

You need to be very, very careful about this kind of sowing discord, and it is easy for lay people to create this kind of karma.

The general level of lying is the words that are said between husband and wife and friends to sow discord.

The retribution is to cause relatives and friends to stay away or to fight and quarrel. People around you cannot live in harmony and choose to live in places with uneven terrain.

332

The result of not talking twice is that you will have more and more friends, and you will be liked by more and more people. Everyone believes in whatever you say, and you will be respected by your family and subordinates, and it will be easy to achieve your career.

The consequences of evil speech is to curse people.

If you scold Buddhas, Bodhisattvas and teachers, the result in the next life will be going to hell. This is a very serious slander.

If you scold your parents, it is also a huge karma, and there will be very painful consequences.

In addition, because you have once scolded others, you will also be scolded and hated by others, and your voice will often be hoarse. Chronic pharyngitis is the result of bad words in previous lives.

People who often speak harshly will often accept the harsh words of others, or the strong tone of voice, which is not liked by everyone in the crowd.

Especially when meeting someone who has been scolded by him in a previous life, the two will get bored with each other as soon as they meet, and they will not be pleasing to the eye no matter how they look at it.

Many husbands and wives are at odds, but also because of the reasons they used to speak badly.

People who often speak ill will be born in the next life where there are many rotten wood and thorns.

What's more serious is that when you speak ill, it is easy to generate hatred, create more bad karma, and bring about more serious consequences.

333

Many people have doubts about educating their children, and think that if they don't scold their children, what should they do?

In fact, whether it is a bad word or not, we must pay attention to the thoughts and motives.

The existence of greed, hatred, and delusion in the mind counts as bad karma, and without it, it counts as bad karma.

If you scold your child with hatred, if you hate that iron is not steel, if you hate that your child is not as good as someone else's child, this is bad language, and it will also lead to resentment from the child.

If the parents are not greedy and the children must achieve a certain goal, such as test scores; and if they speak with kindness and are not angry, the children will not resent their parents.

Because the parents’ hearts are good, the message of loving-kindness is passed on to the child, which will make him understand the parents’ hearts.

The result of not saying bad words is that the throat and throat will be healthy, and people will be more liked by everyone.

Because I don't say bad words, it is often easy for others to speak in front of me.

The retribution of eloquent speech is to speak ill of right and wrong, to speak ill of others, to speak ill of this person, and to speak ill of that person.

If there are a lot of slang-speakers in an area, strange things can happen, such as if the tree doesn't bear fruit on time, or ripens at a season when it shouldn't.

334

The consequence of flattering speech is that the expressions have no value and do not receive the respect they deserve.

The same words have different effects when spoken by different people. People who don’t speak judgementally have more influence and prestige, and people will listen to them.

There is a difference between greed and greediness.
"Greediness" is not necessarily bad. For example, we are greedy for rebirth in the Land of Ultimate Bliss, so we often recite Amitabha Buddha; we are greedy for Buddha, so we study Buddhism;

What is greed? A great desire for one's own and other's possessions is greed.

Greed has five characteristics:

There is worry: especially indulging in nostalgia for one's own wealth.

Greedy: Always eager for wealth growth, only accumulation, reluctance to use.

Have a gluttonous heart: deeply envious and coveting the wealth of others.

Scheming: always thinking about how to take possession of other people's wealth.

Veiled mind: the mind is full of greed, without feeling ashamed, and without awakening.

With these five characteristics, it is greed in the ten evil karma.

335

The result of greed is that what you get is not what you want.

If you can't get what you want, you will often encounter people or things you hate.

For example, when someone needs help, he will leave.

When you hate someone, that person will always appear, which is also a terrible karma.

No greed: no greed for other people's property, the result will be wishful thinking.

When you are not greedy, wealth or opportunity will come naturally.

When you are greedy, you will not be able to chase after wealth, and you will not be able to ask for it. Life and career are very hard.

The Retribution of Hatred: Hatred is the greatest negative karma among the ten evil karmas.
Anger means losing your temper and getting angry, and anger can easily eliminate any blessings you have accumulated.

People with great amounts of anger usually go to hell.

For example, if you are angry with a Buddha or Bodhisattva who has come to earth, the blessings accumulated over a hundred kalpas will be eliminated in an instant, and you will go to hell in the next life, and you will stay in hell for a hundred kalpas. If the opponent is a bodhisattva of the eighth bhumi or more, the blessings of a thousand kalpas will be eliminated at once, and you will spend a thousand kalpas in hell; if you are angry with ordinary bodhisattvas, the blessings of one kalpa will be eliminated, and you will stay in hell.

Therefore, we must never be angry with Buddhas and Bodhisattvas, because we do not know who is a Bodhisattvas or not, so it is easy to create such bad karma.

336

If you develop anger towards your teacher, you will wipe out all the blessings accumulated over a kalpa.

Being angry with someone who is kind to you, your parents, and your relatives will also wipe out a few years of good fortune.

Even being angry with ordinary people will wipe out the blessings that you have worked so hard to accumulate over a period of time.

In addition to the blessings that have been dedicated and the blessings of emptiness, the general blessings, such as prostration and Buddha recitation, will be eliminated.

Anger not only destroys good fortune, but also leads to internal poison, which leads to aging and ugliness.

Western scientists have studied that when a person is angry, if he collects his breath and breathes on a mouse, the mouse will die immediately, showing that angry people even have poisonous breath.

A very beautiful person, if he loses his temper every day and always has anger on his face, will easily become ugly and will grow old very quickly. It is because the anger produces internal poison.

When anger arises, thoughts of harm often arise along with it. For example, when you are angry, you may feel anger in your heart and hope that the other person will die.

Therefore, it will inspire the troubles of being hurt by others, and often feel fear for no reason, always feel that someone is trying to harm you, and it is easy to provoke the hurt of others' anger.

Also, we all know that if someone is angry, the people around them will feel uncomfortable too.

Because there is a kind of energy vibration in angry people, and this kind of vibration can make others afraid.

When many people lose their temper at the same time, the energy caused by the vibration will be very large. If tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of people are constantly angry and resentful, the energy of the vibration can almost shake the world.

There are many reasons for causing earthquakes, one of which is because of anger, and the resentment of sentient beings is too much and too heavy.

Earthquakes, fires, hurricanes, wars and plagues are mostly caused by hatred.

There is also a great evil spirit in the vibrations of anger. The gods of the earth and the world are afraid of this evil spirit. If a person is often angry, these gods will stay away and no longer protect the person.

And it will also attract demons, because demons follow evil qi. Over time, they will create even greater evil karma.

So we must deal with anger, or be able to control it.

First of all, at ordinary times, you should pay attention to the consequences and faults of anger, and gradually imprint them in your mind and consciousness.

Then you have to remind yourself frequently of things that may make you unhappy, and stay vigilant.

In this way, if you are in a bad mood, when the attack is about to occur, immediately grab the emotion that causes anger and control it.


In the beginning, you may realize after being angry that you were angry just now.

In fact, this is a good thing. We already have the awareness to catch this emotion, and we have noticed the thief of anger, and we will slowly catch it sooner to suppress the signs of anger.

Not being angry will lead to health and longevity. Nagarjuna Bodhisattva lived for 600 years and was never angry in his life. 

Asanga Bodhisattva lived for 400 years, and Yueshang Bodhisattva lived for more than 350 years, all of which are the result of not being angry.

The Result of Clinging to Wrong Views:

Clinging to wrong views is stubbornly clinging to upside-down ideas.
Bad things are considered good, good things are considered bad; things that exist do not exist, and things that do not exist exist.

These are wrong views. Upside-down notions.

For example, Buddhas and Bodhisattvas do exist, but some people think they do not. Why? They say that they can't see them.

There are many things that our naked eyes have not seen, but it cannot be said that there is nothing just because we have not seen it.

The six realms of rebirth exist, and so do the three worlds of cause and effect. These are invisible to the eyes, but it cannot be said that they do not exist.

Once you have wrong views, everything you do will be wrong.

339

When a person clings to a wrong view, his character will become crooked, he will become more paranoid, he will spend his whole life in the inversion of right and wrong, and he will go to hell in the next life.

In addition to being confused oneself, it can also affect others, harming oneself and others, but we are not aware of it.

When there are many people in the world who hold wrong views, water and mineral resources will disappear.

Gold mines and silver mines will gradually disappear, gold will turn into stone, and good things will become bad or disappear. These are the results of clinging to wrong views.

(2) How to Eliminate Karmic Obstacles

In order to respect cause and effect, one must first practice the ten virtuous precepts.

If the ten virtuous precepts are not cultivated well, there will be many obstacles in the practice, and there will be even greater and more karmic obstacles in the next life.

When we think about the contents of the ten evil karmas, we will know how many karmas we have violated and how much karma we have created.

Once karma has been created, we must deal with it. We use the Four Forces to Eliminate Karma to get rid of our negative karma.

The four antidotes are the power of reliance, the power to give up, the power to get rid of evil, and the power to counteract.

The power of reliance: The power of reliance is to take refuge and generate bodhicitta. 

After taking refuge, many karmic obstacles will naturally be eliminated, and the same is true of bodhicitta, which is called the power of reliance.

What they rely on is the power to eliminate karma, the power of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas.

Abandoning power: 

Abandoning power is a feeling of remorse for the karma you have created.
For example, repent in your heart: 

"I did a lot of bad things in the past, but now I regret it, and I won't do it again in the future."

With a repentant heart, a lot of karma will naturally be eliminated.

To be free from evil forces is to be free from evil karma.
For example, vowing: 

"From today onwards, I will no longer commit this kind of bad deed."

This kind of firm determination is to be free from evil forces.

Studying the Buddhadharma, reciting the Buddha, reciting mantras, chanting sutras, and repenting are all countermeasures for negative karma.
If the karma is not dealt with in time, it will grow rapidly.

Therefore, every night we have to repent of the karma we created that day. If we do not repent, the karmic load will double.

341

For example, if one kills one ant today, but does not repent before going to bed at night, tomorrow will become the karma of killing two ants, four the day after tomorrow, eight the day after, and sixteen the next day. In this way, after five days, there will be the karma of killing thirty-two ants.

The karma multiplies every day, which is terrifying.

Therefore, every day before going to bed, we should recite thirty-five Buddha confession texts, or twenty-one hundred-syllable mantras to prevent the growth of karma.

If you learn the Vajrasattva repentance method, and you can think and visualize rationally, and then recite the hundred-syllable mantra 100,000 times, all karmic obstacles can be eliminated.

This is to use the power of antidote to deal with karmic obstacles. Buddhism has many methods of repenting of sins.

Use the above four powers to eliminate karma, no matter how big the karma is, it can be eliminated.

Once upon a time, there was a man named Zhigao (Yangguli Mara or Yanggu Mara), and he believed very much in a pagan master.

The master said to him, "I will teach you a very special secret mantra, but it will require the thumbs of a thousand living people to make rosary beads."

He believed it.

Then he grabbed people everywhere and chopped off their thumbs. A total of 999 thumbs, and many people died.

Finally, when he was only one thumb short of a thousand, he saw Shakyamuni Buddha, and he chased after him. The Buddha seemed to be walking slowly, step by step, but he could not catch up with all his strength.

After a while, the Buddha stopped and stuck out his finger. He wanted the Buddha's thumb. Buddha Shakyamuni asked, "What do you want to do with it?" 

He said, "My master wants to teach me a mantra, which requires a rosary made of the thumbs of a thousand living people."

The Buddha said: "You are ignorant of the good teacher, this is an evil teacher, you must stay away from him.

You have killed nine hundred and ninety-nine people like this and chopped off their thumbs, what a sin! After hearing this, Zhigao regretted it, converted to Buddhism, and repented before Shakyamuni Buddha. After a few years, his karma was eliminated and he attained the fruit of Arhatship.

When Venerable Milarepa was a child, his father died, his uncle and aunt seized his family's property and made him, his mother and sister work for them as servants.

His mother often said to him, "I heard that there is a Bon religion in Tibet. I want you to go and learn some skills and come back and curse them. If you don't go, I will hang myself in front of you."

Milarepa went to Bon to learn the method of curse.

On returning, on the wedding day of his uncle's eldest son, Milarepa chanted a curse. Thunder exploded in the air, hailstorms fell, houses collapsed, and thirty-five people and horses were killed.

This was a very serious killing. Later, Milarepa eliminated this karma through ascetic practice and repentance.

Therefore, no matter how great the negative karma is, it can be eliminated through repentance.

343

At the same time of repentance, if you recite sutras and practice diligently, these karmic obstacles will be eliminated faster.

Not only do we have to eliminate great negative karma, but even the smallest karma must be completely eliminated, and we must repent and make amends.

Otherwise, even after hundreds of years and hundreds of kalpas, there will still be retribution.

After the seeds of karma have been exhausted, there will be no retribution.

344

Section 5: If a human being can respect cause and effect, he will not fall into the three evil realms.

However, we not only want to avoid falling into the evil realms and obtain the fruits of humans and heaven, but also to obtain a precious human body.

Among the people with a precious human life, the one who is most conducive to the practice of Buddhism is the one with the eight freedoms. The eight virtues will be faster and more powerful in the practice of liberation.

A person with the eight virtues includes the following eight aspects:

1. Longevity and long-life of the human body can make the practice time more abundant, and it is more certain to liberate.

When propagating the Dharma to benefit living beings, it can also benefit more sentient beings.

2. When practitioners practice the bodhisattva way to save sentient beings, the appearance of dignity has a certain effect.

Nagarjuna Bodhisattva lived for six hundred years. From the age of one hundred and twenty, his appearance changed into that of a sixteen-year-old boy. He had similar marks to the Buddha's thirty-two and eighty-sixty marks. It was very dignified.

When Nagarjuna Bodhisattva taught the Prajna Sutra, very few people could understand it, but there were many people who went to see Nagarjuna Bodhisattva.

After meeting Nagarjuna Bodhisattva, everyone made a vow to be like Nagarjuna Bodhisattva, to be liberated and become a Buddha or become a Bodhisattva. In this way, many people have been saved.

3. Born into a noble family 

In modern society, there is no noble title, but there are still people who are rich, kind, and the three treasures of pure faith.

If you are born into such a family, there will be fewer obstacles to learning Buddhism.

4. Wealth and popularity: 

People with wealth and popularity will have a an easier time  of doing good deeds and practicing.

5. Possess morality. 

To speak virtue is to say that the words are convincing, appealing and influential.

Everyone will believe and respond.

346

6. If an authoritative person possesses the power that is conducive to the practice of the Dharma, they will be able to gain the freedom to practice the Dharma, and they will also be able to inspire more people to practice the Dharma.

7. Physical obstacles will be fewer for men when they study the Dharma.

Men's and women's troubles are the same, but from a physiological point of view, women's physical troubles will still be a little more, and there will be more feelings and pains. For example, women are going to have children and so on.

In addition, it will be easier for men to travel or go in and out of crowds, and they can also live alone in secluded places to practice the Dharma, and there will be less obstacles or influences in the practice.

8. Possessing power refers to having sufficient and outstanding conditions in various aspects such as body, wisdom, and ability.

When the body is strong and healthy, it can endure hard ascetic practices like Venerable Milarepa.

If you have enough wisdom, you won't get tired when you practice the Dharma, your mind won't get tired easily, your ability to endure is strong, and it's easier to practice diligently.

347

We have just described a precious human body with the eight freedoms.

When we can rely on a precious human body with the eight freedoms to practice the Dharma, it is very comfortable, very happy, relatively relaxed, reaching liberation and Buddhahood faster.

When the conditions are met, it will be very simple and easy to forgive others.

348

The sixth section summarizes the path of the mortals. 

In the path of the mortals, the real practice is the ten virtues and taking refuge.

After completing these two dharmas, later generations will obtain the fruits of humans and heaven.

Besides, it is more important to generate several kinds of thoughts.

**First of all, it is necessary to achieve the rare view of being full of leisure and endowments.**

Only when the concept of the rarity of a precious human body is born can one truly realize the preciousness of the human body.

Only then will you understand that the human body is like a wish-fulfilling gem. Relying on the present human body, one can obtain the fruits of humans and heaven, become a Buddha and attain liberation, and even be reborn in the Pure Land.

It is a pity to be able to realize that it is a pity not to practice after obtaining a precious human body! In this way, every time I think of this, my rare and precious human life, I will motivate myself to practice.

Then to achieve the concept of impermanence in life.

When there is no concept of impermanence of life, the practice will sometimes be diligent and sometimes slack.

After realizing the concept of impermanence of life, you will definitely be diligent in practicing the Dharma.

At this time, in the depths of consciousness, a firm belief has been formed, believing that the only thing that will help you when you are dying is the Dharma, and nothing other than the Dharma can help. Nothing else can be relied upon.

We also understand that people are bound to die, and that the time of their death is uncertain, and we don't even know if they can live through today and see tomorrow.

Therefore, we must practice today, and we must diligently practice the Dharma of the Buddha.

349

The next step is to understand the three evil realms of suffering.

First, think carefully about the pain of the three evil realms, and seriously think about how you would feel if you really fell into the evil realms, until a sense of dread arises from the bottom of your heart.

At this time, taking refuge in the Three Jewels is a genuine refuge, and can truly recognize the preciousness of the Three Jewels.

Then continue to think about the vast benefits of taking refuge, such as accumulating blessings, eliminating karmic obstacles, etc., and strengthen your confidence in the Three Jewels.

After sincerely taking refuge, you must also think about the truth of cause and effect.

After taking refuge in the Three Jewels of the Guru, although you can temporarily avoid falling into the evil path, you still need to respect the law of cause and effect, otherwise you will still fall into the evil realms.

To respect cause and effect, we must understand the nature of karma.

Through learning and cultivating the ten karma paths, I have come to know the gross good and evil karma, and the results of the ten evil deeds.

Finally, I also learned about the eight meritorious persons who are most suitable for practicing the Dharma.

This concludes the explanation of the path of the Lower Scope.

When training in the Aspects of the Path, after understanding clearly the impermanence of life, if you can realize that even if you get the Fruit of gods and men, he possibility of falling into the evil realms in the next life will still exist, and the only way out is to achieve liberation from the six realms of rebirth.

At this time, the idea of ​​​​seeking liberation will arise in the mind, and in this way, one will enter the path of the Middle Scope.

This mantra is set in the scriptures to eliminate the sin of mistaken crossing
