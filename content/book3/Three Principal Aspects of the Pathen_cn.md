Three Principal Aspects of the Path
by Je Tsongkhapa Lobzang Drakpa

Homage to the precious noble masters!

The very essence of all the buddhas’ teachings,
一切佛经心要义,
The path that is praised by the noble bodhisattvas,
是诸菩萨所赞道,
And the entrance for all fortunate ones desiring liberation—
有缘求解脱津梁,
To the best of my ability, I shall now set forth.
我今随力而宣说。


You who are unattached to saṃsāra’s pleasures,
于三有乐不贪著
And strive to make full use of the freedoms and advantages,
为暇满义而精进
You who follow the path delighting all the buddhas—
志依胜者所喜道
Fortunate ones, listen well, with a clear and open mind.
诸有缘者净意听。


Whilst lacking pure renunciation there is no way to pacify
无出离心无息灭,
The continual thirst for pleasure in the ocean of saṃsāra,
希求有海乐果法,
And since all living beings are bound by their craving for existence,
由贪有乐缚众生,
You must begin by finding the determination to be free.
故先寻求出离心。


The freedoms and advantages are rare, and there’s no time to waste—

Reflect on this again and yet again, and dispel attachment to this life.

To dispel attachment to your future lives, contemplate repeatedly

The unfailing effects of karma and the sufferings of saṃsāra.

业果不虚轮回苦，勤思消除后世贪。
暇满难得寿无常，串习能除此生欲。

When, through growing accustomed to thinking in this way,
Hope for the pleasures of saṃsāra no longer arises even for an instant,
And throughout both day and night you long for liberation,
Then, at that time, true renunciation has been born.

　　修已于轮回盛事，不生刹那之希望，
　　昼夜唯求解脱心，起时是生出离心。

Yet if this renunciation is not embraced
By the pure motivation of bodhicitta,
It will not become a cause for the perfect bliss of unsurpassed awakening,
So the wise should generate supreme bodhicitta.

　　若无菩提心摄持，出离不成无上觉，
　　圆满安乐之因故，智者应发菩提心。

Beings are swept along by the powerful current of the four rivers,[1]
Tightly bound by the chains of their karma, so difficult to undo,
Ensnared within the iron trap of their self-grasping,
And enshrouded in the thick darkness of ignorance.

　　四瀑流冲难阻止，业力绳索紧密系，
　　投入我执铁笼中，无明黑暗笼罩之。

Again and yet again, they are reborn in limitless saṃsāra,
And constantly tormented by the three forms of suffering.[2]
This is the current condition of all your mothers from previous lives.
Contemplate their plight and generate supreme bodhichitta.

　　无边有中生又生，三苦逼迫常无断，
　　诸母情状与处境，思已发起殊胜心。

If you lack the wisdom that realizes the nature of things,
Although you might grow accustomed to renunciation and bodhicitta,
You will be incapable of cutting through conditioned existence at its root.
Exert yourself, therefore, in the methods for realizing interdependence.

　　不具通达真理慧，虽修出离菩提心，
　　不能断除有根故，应勤通达缘起法。

The one who sees that cause and effect operate infallibly
For all the phenomena of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa,
And for whom any objects of conceptual focus have subsided,
Has set out upon the path delighting all the buddhas.

　　能见轮涅一切法，从因生果皆不虚，
　　且能破诸所执境，彼入佛陀所喜道。

The knowledge that appearances arise unfailingly in dependence,
And the knowledge that they are empty and beyond all assertions—
As long as these two appear to you as separate,
There can be no realization of the Buddha’s wisdom.

　　现相缘起不虚妄，离执空性二了解，
　　何时见为相违者，尚未通达佛密意。

Yet when they arise at once, not each in turn but both together,
Then through merely seeing unfailing dependent origination
Certainty is born, and all modes of misapprehension fall apart—
That is when discernment of the view has reached perfection.

　　不复轮替而同时，甫见不欺缘起已，
　　普灭实执所执境，彼时见观察圆满。

When you know that appearances dispel the extreme of existence,
While the extreme of nothingness is eliminated by emptiness,[3]
And you also come to know how emptiness arises as cause and effect,
Then you will be immune to any view entailing clinging to extremes.

　　又由现相除有边，及由空性除无边，
　　若知空性现因果，不为边执见所夺。

When, in this way, you have correctly understood
The key points of the three principal aspects of the path,
Withdraw to solitude, dear son, strengthen your diligence,
And swiftly accomplish the ultimate and lasting aim.

　　如是三主道诸要，子能如实通达时，
　　当依静处起精进，速疾成办究意愿。
