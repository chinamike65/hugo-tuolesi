All Mahayana and Vajrayana Buddhist practices begin with Refuge. Chant along with the magnificent voice of Yoko Dharma as she sings the refuge in Tibetan (words prompted on-screen with English translation) — including the Bodhisattva aspiration. 

Then, enhance the Mahayana perfection by chanting the Four Immeasurables — wishing immeasurable happiness to all sentient beings in the Universe, with a second chant.
