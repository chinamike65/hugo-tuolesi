The Lamp for the Path to Enlightenment
by Atiśa Dīpaṃkara

In the language of India: Bodhipāthapradipaṃ
In the language of Tibet: jangchup lam gyi drönma (byang chub lam gyi sgron ma)
In the English language: The Lamp for the Path to Enlightenment

Homage to the youthful bodhisattva Mañjuśrī!

With great reverence, I prostrate to all the Victorious Ones of the three times,
to their Dharma, and to the members of the Saṅgha.
Urged by my good student Jangchup Ö,
I shall elucidate the Lamp for the Path to Enlightenment.

Understand there are three types of individuals—
lesser, middling, and superior.
I shall set out a system of classification in which
their respective characteristics are made completely clear.

Know that those who, by whatever means,
exclusively seek mere mundane pleasures
of saṃsāra for their own benefit
are inferior individuals.

Those who have turned their backs on saṃsāra’s pleasures
and refrain from sinful karma,
striving merely for pacification for themselves alone—
such individuals are said to be middling.

Those who truly desire to completely eradicate
all the suffering of others
through their own personal suffering—
such individuals are supreme.

For these noble beings
who desire supreme enlightenment,
I shall explain the perfect methods
taught by spiritual teachers.

In the presence of paintings, statues,
stūpas, and other representations of the perfect Buddha,
offer flowers, fragrant incense,
and whatever else you can afford.

With the seven-fold offering also
taught in Samantabhadra’s Aspiration to Good Deeds,
and with the thought never to turn back
until attaining the essence of complete enlightenment,

With fervent faith in the Three Jewels,
place one knee on the ground,
join the palms together,
and first take refuge three times.

Then, beginning with a mind of love
for all sentient beings,
consider all those, without exception,
who suffer in the three lower realms
from birth, death, and so forth.

With the wish to liberate all beings
from the suffering of suffering,
from suffering and its causes,
generate bodhicitta with irreversible resolve.

Maitreya has thoroughly explained
the qualities of generating
such aspirational bodhicitta
in the Sūtra of the Arrayed Tree.[1]

Having understood the limitless qualities
of the mind of complete enlightenment
from reading this sūtra or listening to a spiritual teacher,
generate this very state of mind again and again.

The Sūtra Requested by Vīradatta
thoroughly explains its merits.
Here, I shall summarize them
by citing only three verses:

“If the merit of bodhicitta
were to take physical form,
even the whole of space itself
could not contain its vastness.

“If a person were to fill with jewels
as many buddhafields as there are
grains of sands in the Ganges River
and offer them to the Protector of the World,

“This would be far surpassed by the offering
of someone joining their hands together
and bowing in their mind to enlightenment,
for this is beyond any limit.”

You should generate aspirational bodhicitta
and constantly increase it through great exertion.
You should fully uphold your precepts as instructed
so that you may recollect this in other lifetimes as well.

Without the actual vow of engaged bodhicitta,
your perfect aspiration will not develop further.
With the wish to develop perfect enlightenment,
make effort to take the vow in full.

Only those who continuously maintain
one of the seven types of individual liberation vows
or other vows will have the fortune for
the bodhisattva vow, no one else.

According to the Tathāgata’s explanation of
the seven classes of vows of individual liberation,
glorious pure conduct—celibacy—is said to be supreme.
Take, therefore, the vows of full ordination.

According to the ritual described in the
discipline chapter of The Bodhisattva Levels,
you should take the vow from a good,
authentically qualified spiritual teacher.

Understand that a good spiritual teacher
is one skilled in the vow ritual,
who lives by the vow and possesses
the patience and compassion to bestow it.

In case, after searching for someone like this,
you are unable to find such a spiritual teacher,
I shall explain another ritual
with which to properly take the vow.

With utmost clarity, I shall write how
long ago, when he was Ambarāja,
Mañjuśrī generated bodhicitta,
as described in The Ornament of Mañjuśrī’s
Buddhafield Sūtra.

“In the presence of the Protectors,
I generate the mind of perfect enlightenment,
and I invite all beings as my guests—
These I shall liberate from saṃsāra.

“From this moment until
I achieve supreme enlightenment,
I shall have no thoughts of harm,
no anger, avarice, or jealousy.

“I shall cultivate pure conduct,
and abandon sin and craving.
With joy for the vows of discipline,
I shall train to emulate the Buddhas.

“Taking no joy in swiftly
attaining enlightenment for myself,
I will remain until the very end
for the sake of even a single being.

“I shall prepare immeasurable,
inconceivable realms
and will remain in the ten directions
for any who call out my name.

“Having purified all
physical and verbal actions,
I shall also purify my mental activities,
and will avoid all that is non-virtuous.”

Completely pure body, speech, and mind
cause you to maintain the actual vow of engaged bodhicitta.
By properly practicing the discipline of the three trainings,
your reverence for these trainings grows greater.

Therefore, by exerting yourself in the bodhisattva vows,
bent on pure and perfect enlightenment,
the accumulations for complete enlightenment
will be fully perfected.

All Buddhas say that the cause
for completing the accumulations,
whose natures are merit and wisdom,
is the development of the higher knowledges.

Just as a bird with unfledged wings
cannot fly through the sky,
one who lacks the power of the higher knowledges
will be unable to work for beings’ benefit.

The merit of a single day and night
gained by one with the higher knowledges
is not attained within a hundred lifetimes
by one who is without them.

Those who desire to swiftly complete
the accumulations for perfect enlightenment
will accomplish the higher knowledges
through effort, not through laziness.

The higher knowledges will not arise
without the accomplishment of śamatha;
therefore, strive again and again
to accomplish calm abiding.

As long as the requisites for śamatha
are weak, even if you were to meditate
with great effort for thousands of years,
still you would not accomplish samādhi.

Therefore, maintaining the requisites
taught in the Collection of Samādhi Chapter,
place your mind on any suitable
virtuous object of focus.

When the practitioner achieves śamatha,
higher knowledges are also attained.
But without the practice of the perfection of wisdom,
the obscurations will not be eliminated.

Therefore, in order to abandon, without exception,
all emotional and cognitive obscurations,
constantly meditate on the practice
of the perfection of wisdom with skillful means.

Wisdom without skillful means
and skillful means without wisdom
are said to be a form of bondage.
Therefore, do not relinquish either one.

To eliminate doubts concerning
what is wisdom and what are skillful means,
I shall clarify the correct distinction
between skillful means and wisdom.

With the exception of the perfection of wisdom,
the accumulations of all virtuous actions,
such as the perfections of generosity and so forth,
are described as skillful means by the Victorious Ones.

Whosoever cultivates wisdom
through the power of cultivating skillful means
will swiftly attain enlightenment—
but not through meditation on selflessness alone.

What we call ‘wisdom’ is thoroughly explained
as an understanding of the emptiness of inherent existence—
the realization that the aggregates, elements,
and sense sources are unproduced.

Logically, something existent cannot be produced,
nor can something nonexistent, like a sky-flower.
Consequently, as both faults would apply,
something which is both could likewise not come into being.

An entity is not produced from itself,
nor from something else, nor from both,
nor without causes. Therefore,
it has no inherent nature.

Alternatively, when you analyze any phenomenon
as to whether it is singular or multiple,
no inherent nature is observed.
Phenomena are thus determined to have no nature.

The reasoning in The Seventy Verses on Emptiness,[2]
The Root Verses on the Middle Way,[3] and so forth,
explains how it is proven that
the nature of all things is emptiness.

As this text would become too long,
I have not elaborated further here.
In order to facilitate your meditation,
I will fully explain only the established conclusions.

Thus, any meditation on selflessness
in which you do not observe the inherent nature
of any phenomena, without exception,
is, in and of itself, the cultivation of wisdom.

Just as wisdom sees no inherent nature
in any phenomena whatsoever,
let wisdom itself be subject to analysis,
and meditate free from conceptuality.

The nature of this existence,
which arises from conceptuality, is conceptuality.
Therefore, to abandon conceptuality
in its entirety is supreme nirvāṇa.

Accordingly, the Blessed One said,
“The great ignorance of conceptuality
plunges us into the ocean of saṃsāra.
Resting in non-conceptual samādhi,
non-conceptuality is as clear as the sky.”

Similarly, in The Dhāraṇī of Entering Non-Conceptuality:[4]
“If the heirs of the Victorious Ones
contemplate, without concepts, this noble Dharma,
they will transcend conceptuality, so hard to overcome,
and eventually attain the state of non-conceptuality.”

After gaining certainty from scriptures
and reasoning that all phenomena
are unproduced and without inherent nature,
meditate without conceptuality.

Accordingly, from meditating on suchness,
eventually, you will attain heat and other signs;
“Supreme Joy” and the other bhūmis will be attained;
And Buddhahood, the enlightened state, will not be far away.

If you wish to fully perfect the accumulations
for enlightenment with ease,
through pacifying, enriching, and the other activities
accomplished by the mantric powers;

through the power of eight great accomplishments;
through accomplishing the “fine vase” and others—
If you wish to take up the practice of Secret Mantra
as taught in the action, conduct, and other tantras,

then, in order to receive empowerment
from a vajra master, you must please the
noble spiritual teacher through veneration,
offerings of wealth and the like,
and endeavouring to carry out all commands.

Through the complete bestowal of the vajra master empowerment
by a spiritual master whom you have delighted,
you will be completely purified of all sins
and gain the fortune of accomplishing the siddhis.

As The Great Tantra of the Primordial Buddha
emphatically forbids it,
those observing celibacy should never
receive the secret and wisdom empowerments.

If those practicing celibacy and asceticism
were to receive those empowerments,
they would be obliged to practice what is forbidden,
and their vows of austerity would thus deteriorate.

This creates a downfall which would
defeat those practicing yogic discipline.
As they would be certain to fall into the lower realms,
they would never gain accomplishment.

For those who have received the vajra master empowerment
and have knowledge of suchness, there is no fault
in receiving or teaching any tantra,
performing fire pūjās, offerings, and so forth.

At the urging of Jangchub Ö,
I, the Elder Dīpaṃkara Śrī, have concisely
explained the Path of Enlightenment,
as I’ve seen it taught in the sūtras and other Dharma teachings.

This concludes The Lamp for the Path to Enlightenment, composed by the great master Dīpaṃkara Śrījñāna. It was translated and finalized by the great Indian abbot himself and the great translator and editor Gewé Lodrö. This teaching was composed in the Toling Temple in Zhang Zhung.
