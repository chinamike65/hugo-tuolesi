> The root of all these is ignorance;

> You taught that it is dependent origination,

> 
>
> 4
>
> This being so, who will find, O Savior,
>
> A more wonderful way to praise you
>
> Than [to praise you] for having taught

> This origination through dependence?

> By grasping at it the childish

> Strengthen bondage to extreme views;

> To cut free from the net of elaborations.

> 
>
> 7
>
> Since this teaching is not seen elsewhere,

> You alone are the Teacher;

> Like calling fox a lion, for a Tirthika

> It would be a word of flattery.

>
> 8
>
> Wondrous teacher! Wondrous refuge!
>
> Wondrous speaker! Wondrous savior!
>
> I pay homage to that teacher
>
> Who taught well dependent origination.
>
> 
>
> 9
>
> To help heal sentient beings,
>
> O Benefactor, you have taught
>
> The peerless reason to ascertain
>
> Emptiness, the heart of the teaching.
>
> 
>
> 10
>
> This way of dependent origination,
>
> Those who perceive it
>
> As contradictory or as unestablished,
>
> How can they comprehend your system?
>
> 
>
> 11
>
> For you, when one sees emptiness
>
> In terms of the meaning of dependent origination,
>
> Then being devoid of intrinsic existence and
>
> Possessing valid functions do not contradict.
>
> 
>
> 12
>
> Whereas when one sees the opposite,
>
> Since there can be no function in emptiness
>
> Nor emptiness in what has functions,
>
> One falls into a dreadful abyss, you maintain.
>
> 
>
> 13
>
> Therefore in your teaching
>
> Seeing dependent origination is hailed;
>
> That too not as an utter non-existence
>
> Nor as an intrinsic existence.
>
> 
>
> 14
>
> The non-contingent is like a sky flower,
>
> Hence there is nothing that is not dependent.
>
> If things exist through their essence, their dependence on
>
> Causes and conditions for their existence is a contradiction.
>
> 
>
> 15
>
> “Therefore since no phenomena exist
>
> Other than origination through dependence,
>
> No phenomena exist other than
>
> Being devoid of intrinsic existence,” you taught.
>
> 
>
> 16
>
> “Because intrinsic nature cannot be negated,
>
> If phenomena possess some intrinsic nature,
>
> Nirvana would become impossible
>
> And elaborations could not be ceased,” you taught.
>
> 
>
> 17
>
> Therefore who could challenge you?
>
> You who proclaim with lion’s roar
>
> In the assembly of learned ones repeatedly
>
> That everything is utterly free of intrinsic nature?
>
> 
>
> 18
>
> That there is no intrinsic existence at all
>
> And that all functions as “this arising
>
> In dependence on that,” what need is there to say
>
> That these two converge without conflict?
>
> 
>
> 19
>
> “It is through the reason of dependent origination
>
> That one does not lean towards an extreme;”
>
> That you’ve declared this excellently is the reason,
>
> O Savior, of your being an unexcelled speaker.
>
> 
>
> 20
>
> “All of this is devoid of essence,”
>
> And “From this arises that effect” –
>
> These two certainties complement
>
> Each other with no contradiction at all.
>
> 
>
> 21
>
> What is more amazing than this?
>
> What is more marvellous than this?
>
> If one praises you in this manner,
>
> This is real praise, otherwise not.
>
> 
>
> 22
>
> Being enslaved by ignorance
>
> Those who fiercely oppose you,
>
> What is so astonishing about their being
>
> Unable to bear the sound of no intrinsic existence?
>
> 
>
> 23
>
> But having accepted dependent origination,
>
> The precious treasure of your speech,
>
> Then not tolerating the roar of emptiness –
>
> This I find amazing indeed!
>
> 
>
> 24
>
> The door that leads to no intrinsic existence,
>
> This unexcelled [door of] dependent origination,
>
> Through its name alone, if one grasps
>
> At intrinsic existence, now this person
>
> 
>
> 25
>
> Who lacks the unrivalled entrance,
>
> Well travelled by the Noble Ones,
>
> By what means should one guide him
>
> To the excellent path that pleases you?
>
> 
>
> 26
>
> Intrinsic nature, uncreated and non-contingent,
>
> Dependent origination, contingent and created –
>
> How can these two converge
>
> Upon a single basis without contradiction?
>
> 
>
> 27
>
> Therefore whatever originates dependently,
>
> Though primordially free of intrinsic existence,
>
> Appears as if it does [possess intrinsic existence];
>
> So you taught all this to be illusion-like.
>
> 28
>
> Through this very fact I understand well
>
> The statement that, to what you have taught,
>
> Those opponents who challenge you
>
> Cannot find faults that accord with reason.
>
> 
>
> 29
>
> Why is this so? Because by declaring these
>
> Chances for reification and denigration
>
> Towards things seen and unseen
>
> Are made most remote.
>
> 
>
> 30
>
> Through this very path of dependent origination,
>
> The rationale for your speech being peerless,
>
> Convictions arise in me [also]
>
> That your other words are valid too.
>
> 
>
> 31
>
> You who speak excellently by seeing as it is,
>
> For those who train in your footsteps,
>
> All degenerations will become remote;
>
> For the root of all faults will be undone.
>
> 
>
> 32
>
> But those who turn away from your teaching,
>
> Though they may struggle with hardship for a long time,
>
> Faults increase ever more as if being called forth;
>
> For they make firm the view of self.
>
> 
>
> 33
>
> Aha! When the wise comprehend
>
> The differences between these two,
>
> Why would they not at that point
>
> Revere you from the depths of their being?
>
> 
>
> 34
>
> Let alone your numerous teachings,
>
> Even in the meaning of a small part,
>
> Those who find ascertainment in a cursory way,
>
> This brings supreme bliss to them as well.
>
> 
>
> 35
>
> Alas! My mind was defeated by ignorance;
>
> Though I’ve sought refuge for a long time,
>
> In such an embodiment of excellence,
>
> I possess not a fraction of his qualities.
>
> 
>
> 36
>
> Nonetheless, before the stream of this life
>
> Flowing towards death has come to cease
>
> That I have found slight faith in you –
>
> Even this I think is fortunate.
>
> 
>
> 37
>
> Among teachers, the teacher of dependent origination,
>
> Amongst wisdoms, the knowledge of dependent origination –
>
> You, who’re most excellent like the kings in the worlds,
>
> Know this perfectly well, not others.
>
> 
>
> 38
>
> All that you have taught
>
> Proceeds by way of dependent origination;
>
> That too is done for the sake of nirvana;
>
> You have no deeds that do not bring peace.
>
> 
>
> 39
>
> Alas! Your teaching is such,
>
> In whosoever’s ears it falls,
>
> They all attain peace; so who would not be
>
> Honoured to uphold your teaching?
>
> 
>
> 40
>
> It overcomes all opposing challenges;
>
> It’s free from contradictions between earlier and latter parts;
>
> It grants fulfilment of beings’ two aims –
>
> For this system my joy increases ever more.
>
> 
>
> 41
>
> For its sake you have given away,
>
> Again and again over countless eons,
>
> Sometimes your body, at others your life,
>
> As well as your loving kin and resources of wealth.
>
> 
>
> 42
>
> Seeing the qualities of this teaching
>
> Pulls [hard] from your heart,
>
> Just like what a hook does to a fish;
>
> Sad it is not to have heard it from you.
>
> 
>
> 43
>
> The intensity of that sorrow
>
> Does not let go of my mind,
>
> Just like the mind of a mother
>
> [Constantly] goes after her dear child.
>
> 
>
> 44-45
>
> Here too, as I reflect on your words, I think,
>
> “Blazing with the glory of noble marks
>
> And hallowed in a net of light rays,
>
> This teacher, in a voice of pristine melody,
>
> Spoke thus in such a way.”
>
> The instant such a reflection of the Sage’s form
>
> Appears in my mind it soothes me,
>
> Just as the moon-rays heal fever’s pains.
>
> 
>
> 46
>
> This excellent system, most marvellous,
>
> Some individuals who are not so learned
>
> Have entangled it in utter confusion,
>
> Just like the tangled balbaza grass.
>
> 
>
> 47
>
> Seeing this situation, I strove
>
> With a multitude of efforts
>
> To follow after the learned ones
>
> And sought your intention again and again.
>
> 
>
> 48
>
> At such times as I studied the numerous works
>
> Of both our own [Middle Way] and other schools,
>
> My mind became tormented ever more
>
> Constantly by a network of doubts.
>
> 
>
> 49
>
> The night-lily grove of Nagarjuna’s treatises –
>
> Nagarjuna whom you prophesized
>
> Would unravel your unexcelled vehicle as it is,
>
> Shunning extremes of existence and non-existence –
>
> 
>
> 50
>
> Illuminated by the garland of white lights
>
> Of Candra’s well-uttered insights –
>
> Candra, whose stainless wisdom orb is full,
>
> Who glides freely across scriptures’ space,
>
> 
>
> 51
>
> Who dispels the darkness of extremist hearts
>
> And outshines the constellations of false speakers –
>
> When, through my teacher’s kindness, I saw this
>
> My mind found a rest at last.
>
> 
>
> 52
>
> Of all your deeds, your speech is supreme;
>
> Within that too it is this very speech;
>
> So the wise should remember the Buddha
>
> Through this [teaching of dependent origination].
>
> 
>
> 53
>
> Following such a teacher and having become a renunciate,
>
> Having studied the Conqueror’s words not too poorly,
>
> This monk who strives in the yogic practices,
>
> Such is [the depth of] his reverence to the great Seer!
>
> 
>
> 54
>
> Since it is due to my teacher’s kindness
>
> I have met with the teaching of the unexcelled teacher,
>
> I dedicate this virtue too towards the cause
>
> For all beings to be sustained by sublime spiritual mentors.
>
> 
>
> 55
>
> May the teaching of this Beneficent One till world’s end
>
> Be unshaken by the winds of evil thoughts;
>
> May it always be filled with those who find conviction
>
> In the teacher by understanding the teaching’s true nature.
>
> 
>
> 56
>
> May I never falter even for an instant
>
> To uphold the excellent way of the Sage,
>
> Which illuminates the principle of dependent origination,
>
> Through all my births even giving away my body and life.
>
> 
>
> 57
>
> May I spend day and night carefully reflecting,
>
> “By what means can I enhance
>
> This teaching achieved by the supreme savior
>
> Through strenuous efforts over countless eons?”
>
> 
>
> 58
>
> As I strive in this with pure intention,
>
> May Brahma, Indra and the world’s guardians
>
> And protectors such as Mahakala
>
> Unswervingly, always assist me.
