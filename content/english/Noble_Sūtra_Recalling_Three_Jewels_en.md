The sugata who has reached the state of bliss,

The knower of the entire world,

顶礼一切智智尊！

如是佛陀薄伽梵者，谓：如来、应供、正等觉、明行圆满、善逝、世间解、无上士调御丈夫、天人师、佛、薄伽梵。

诸如来者，是福等流，善根无尽。

安忍庄严，福藏根本，妙好间饰，

众相花敷，行境相顺，见无违逆。

信解欢喜，慧无能胜，力无能屈。

诸有情师，诸菩萨父，众圣者王，往涅磐城者之商主。

妙智无量，辩才难思，语言清净，

音声和美；观身无厌，身无与等。

不染诸欲，不染众色，不染无色。

解脱众苦，善脱诸蕴，不成诸界，防护诸处。

永断诸结，脱离热恼，解脱爱染，越众瀑流。

妙智圆满；住去、来、今诸佛世尊所有妙智；不住涅磐，住真实际。

安住遍现一切有情之地。

是为如来正智殊胜功德。



正法者，谓：善说梵行。

初善、中善、后善。


义妙、文巧。

纯一、圆满、清净、鲜白。

佛、薄伽梵，善说法律。

正得，无病，时无间断。

极善安立，见者不空，智者各别内证。

法律善显。

决定出离，趣大菩提。

无有违逆，成就和顺；
具足依止，断流转道。


圣僧者，谓：正行、应理行、质直行、和敬行。

所应礼敬，所应合掌。

清净功德，净诸信施。


所应惠施，普应惠施。
