title: "Distinguishing the Middle Way from
the Extremes"

---

I bow to the youthful, gentle and brilliant (Manjushri).

Characteristics; obstructions; suchness; the antidotes,
i.e. meditation, the phases and results; the unsurpassable vehicle.

There is incorrect conceptuality,

in which there isn 't the existence of duality.

Emptiness exists in this;

it also exists in those.

---

Appearances are neither empty nor non-empty.

Everything is explained with that view.

Since existent, they do not exist; since non-existent, they exist.

That is the path of the middle way.

---

The object to be known, living beings,

self and partial awareness should be understood

as aspects of appearances that are intensively generated.

These objects do not exist.

---

Their non-existence does not exist either.

Incorrect conceptualization is therefore present,

But it is not like that; it is not primordially non-existent.

Having become exhausted, there is liberation.

---

Although thoughts are dependent, imagined and

thoroughly established,

They are explained through the object (to be known),

through incorrect conceptuality and

through the non-existence of duality.

---

Depending upon fixation, non-fixation is intensively generated.

Depending upon non-fixation, non-fixation is intensively generated.

If that is the case, then fixation exists as the nature of non-fixation.

With that in mind, fixation and non-fixation should be known as equal.

---

Incorrect conceptualization

is mind and mental factors in the three realms;

in which case the object seen is partially known.

(Partial knowledge) arises from the mind as a distinctive feature.

---

One (distinguishing feature) is partial knowledge
of a condition.

Duality accompanies near-experience.

Near-experience and complete isolation (distinction)

are mental events arising from the mind.

---

Due to engendering incorrect conceptuality intensively,

due to enforcing it and clinging to it;

bringing it to completion and

the three isolations;

the near-experience of an appearance,

approaching it without hesitation,

connecting it and directing it;

with suffering, living beings are afflicted.

Although afflictions have three aspects, two aspects,

incorrect conceptuality has seven aspects.

---

If emptiness is summarized briefly,

then one should understand

(nirvana's) definitive characteristics,

the enumeration of the name and the meaning,

the classifications and the argumentation.

---

The definitive characteristics of emptiness are

the non-existence of dualistic things and

the entity of that non-existing thing.

It is not existent nor is it non-existent.

It possesses the characteristics of not being different or the same.

---

If emptiness is summarized briefly,

then its enumeration is:

suchness, the limit of that which is genuine,

the signless, the ultimate and dharmadhatu.

---

Not being other than that, it is not deceptive.

That cessation, which is the object experienced by the noble ones

is the cause of the qualities of the noble ones.

That is the meaning of the enumeration (of names) according to

their sequence.

---

All-encompassing afflictions, partial purity;

those with stains and those without stains.

The substances water, gold and space are pure;

they are likened to purity.

---

Nourishment and nourishing make up the physical body,

the basis of one's situation which is empty.

Who sees it like that?

He too is empty.

---

Bodhisattvas engage in practice

in order to attain the two benefits,

in order to always help living beings,

in order not to give up cyclic existence,

in order not to exhaust what is positive,

in order to completely purify predispositions,

in order to attain the major and

complementary marks of realization,

in order to reveal a Buddha's pure qualities.

---

Just as for the individual,

the non-substantiality of phenomena is here also emptiness.

The existence of the entity of that non-substantiality

is another emptiness than that.

---

If afflictions did not arise,

then all living beings possessing a body would already be liberated.

If complete purity did not arise,

then all exertion would bring no results.

There aren 't afflictions, there aren 't no afflictions;

this isn 't purity, and this isn 't impurity.

---

Pervasive, trivial, excessive and all together;

accepting and rejecting

are taught as two obstructions.

---

The characteristics of afflictions have nine aspects;

taking all together is the actual obstruction.

---

Weariness of samsara; equanimity; seeing suchness;

the view that sees an absence of aggregations and its basis;

cessation; the path; and the three jewels; appreciation; praise;

perfectly understanding material contentment.

The virtues are different than the ten.

---

[Thirty obstructions:]

Lacking exertion; of increasing and expanding;

lacking faith and not training the mind (laziness);

not highly completing the (two) collections;

not possessing the potential (for enlightenment);

not (having) a spiritual friend;

discouragement; not having the practices (of the paramitas);

having bad companions; friends (who dislike the mahayana);

engaging in an unfavorable livelihood;

affliction and karma from the three (body, speech and mind);

not nurturing highest insight; naturally taking on bad livelihood;

laziness; carelessness;

attachment to conditioned existence (samsara);

attachment to enjoyments; becoming depressed;

lacking faith (in the mahayana);

lacking admiration (and longing for the mahayana);

rendering lip-service (only);

not holding the sacred dharma as greatest;

greed for profit; lacking compassion;

bereft of hearing (the mahayana-dharma);

only hearing little (of the mahayana-dharma);

failure to practice samadhi (meditative absorption).

---

[Ten things that are obstructed:]

Virtue; bodhichitta; holding (the mahayana path properly);

intelligence (of becoming a bodhisattva);

non-delusion (on the path of seeing);

non-obstruction (on the path of meditation);

dedication (as skill in method);

fearlessness (regarding the profound and vast mahayana dharma);

non-miserliness (regarding the mahayana-activities);

the (ten) powers (of a Buddha) are virtues, etc.

---

Their obstructions should be known in sets of three.

[The way in which the two correspond:]

The ten active causes are

generating (the wish to engage in what is beneficial);
abiding (in that);

depending (upon what is beneficial);

teaching; transformation; separation (from confusion);

(skilled in helping) others;

relying (upon the mahayana dharma);

understanding (how to engage in the activities of the mahayana);

accomplishing (the ten powers).

Their examples are eyes, nourishment, earth, a butter lamp, fire, etc.

A sickle, a craftsman, smoke, ground, path, etc. (are) others.

---

The obstructions are different than

the view, the paramitas and the levels.

---

As for the foundation, lack of skill and laziness;

diminishing samadhi due to both;

not engaging in practice due to laziness; weak faith;

attachment to mistaken views;

taking up bad ways and familiarization with 

latent predispositions of confusion.

---

Obstructions to the Middle Path of Accumulation

Obstructions to the Great Path of Accumulation

---

Clinging to wealth and a demanding lifestyle;

the obstruction of not caring for sentient beings;

shortcomings and opportunism;

concern for loss and gain; perverse ways of thinking;

exhausting what brings liberation;

exhausting continuous and uninterrupted virtue;

opposing certainty; and

lacking great capacity that obstructs

enjoying and bringing the dharma to full maturation.

---

The goal of omnipresence; the goal of the supreme;

the highest goal itself (is) the goal that accords with the cause.

Clinging to completion does not exist;

various continuums do not exist;

there aren 't afflictions nor purity;

the goal itself is non-existing differences;

the goal that neither diminishes nor increases exists.

Abiding in the four aspects of strength;

not aware of the vast expanse of space;

the ten obstructions are not part of the afflictions.

The antidotes are the grounds of the uncommon ten levels.

---

The obstruction of afflictions and

the obstruction of knowledge are taught.

All obstacles are (summarized) in them.

(When they have) become exhausted, there is liberation.

---

concludes the second chapter entitled "Obstructions "from The

Treatise that Distinguishes the Middle and the Extremes.

---

Root suchness; definition of suchness;

the definitive characteristic (of suchness);

the suchness of causes and results.

---

Coarse and subtle;

renown and the perfectly pure objects;

the summarized and classified characteristics;

being learned in the ten aspects of suchness.

---

The three natures are continuously non-existent;

although present, there is no suchness.

Suchness is existence and non-existence.

The natures are taught to be three.

---

As for those, phenomena and individuals,

the apprehended and the apprehending â€”:

imputed existents, non-existents and negating views

do not arise if one understands them.

Those are the definitions of suchness.

---

The meaning of impermanence is the meaning of non-existence,

the definition of becoming established and ceasing again,

The meaning of stained and unstained

accords with the progression through the root of suchness.

Accepting suffering, the characteristics

and being connected are described as other.

The non-existing entity is not an entity;

it is taught to be empty by nature.

Since the characteristics do not exist, the self does not exist; 

the uncommon characteristics are taught to be specific characteristics.

---

Therefore they are described as the truth of suffering.

Latent predispositions, everything that arises

and not being free are just like that.

---

The nature itself, unborn duality and

latent stains are described as two.

Due to perfect understanding, abandonment and
direct attainment,

the truth of the path is completely described.

---

Imagined, consciousness (dependent) and

related expressions are coarse (relative).

---

The ultimate truth is unique.

The meaning, attainment and presence

are described as the three aspects of the ultimate.

The two aspects of the thoroughly established are

changeless and infallible.

---

The one learned in worldly knowledge only and

the one learned in the three valid sources of knowledge.

---

The perfect and pure object of experience has two aspects,

expressed as one suchness.

---

The fundamental cause, conceptuality and

name are summarized as two aspects: subject and object.

Perfect primordial wisdom as well as highest suchness

are summarized as one suchness.

---

There are two aspects to the suchness of entrance,

abiding and wrong livelihood (in samsara).

Definitive character, partial awareness wisdom and

purity are one in the thoroughly established.

---

The single, the fundamental (cause), the consumer, the creator;
 
and having power;

fulfilling one's own purpose; impermanence;

mental affliction, a pure livelihood;

having yoga; and the freedom of not being free

are seen as being the self

Complete conceptuality and the fact of conceptualityy

are pure due to the meaning ofsuchness.

---

In the beginning there are many;

that is the meaning of summarized and perfectly distinguished.

---

Apprehending, the apprehended and apprehension

are compared with a seed, (which) is described differently.

---

Feelings, completely restricting the meaning (of a perceived object)

and direct experience are different entrances which arise.

---

Not ascribing nor denying causes,

effects and influences.

---

The unwished, the wished, perfect purity,

arising together, mastering,

attaining and always practicing

are another connotation than dependent.

---

Apprehending, abiding, uninterrupted;

due to both experience and purity.

---

Causes and effects which are already experienced 

or similarly not experienced are different.

---

The meaning of the feeling (together with) the cause

is established because of the cause,

the truth of all that arises.

The meaning of pacifying and remedying them

because of having them is described differently.

---

Through understanding qualities, faults and non-conceptuality

one understands that they are other than the self

Since they definitely arise they are called 'other'.

---

Having imputations, having causes, the causal characteristics

and perfect pacification (become) meaningful.

They will be explained at the end.

---

That was the third chapter entitled "How to Abandon the

Obstructions: Knowing Suchness" 

from The Treatise Distinguishing the Middle from the Extremes.

---

Because of taking up bad ways,

because of the causes of conditioned existence,

because of the foundation and

because of an obscured mind,

(one should) engage in the four truths,

which are the close-placement meditation ofmindfulness.

---

If the opponent's side and antidotes

are perfectly known in all aspects,

then due to abandoning them,

joyful exertion arises in four aspects.

---

Resting in them and appropriate activities

become the accumulation of all purposes.

Abandoning the five faults,

relying on the eight applications

which arise from the cause.

---

##### The Five Faults

Laziness, forgetting the oral instructions,

stupor and excitement, under-reacting and over-reacting

are described as the five faults.

---

##### The Antidotes of the Eight Applications

One's situation and abiding in it

are cause and result.

Not becoming forgetful of the reference and

recognizing stupor and excitement;

directly responding and

Returning to genuine stability.

---

After liberation which partially corresponds has been generated:

aspiration; application; mastery;

not becoming forgetful of the perspective;

not becoming distracted; and also perfect differentiation.

---

Since the inappropriate side is shallow,

the power is a later result.

The capacities and powers each correspond as

two partial definitive differentiations.

---

The branch of own nature; the branch of the matrix;

the branch of definitive arising is the third.

The fourth is the branch of benefiting;

the branch of lacking afflictions has three aspects

they are taught to be the basis, matrix and the essence itself.

---

Perfect distinction and making comprehensible;

three aspects bring others to have faith.

The antidotes to the opposite side

are the eight branches of the path.

The view, ethics and modesty are described as being those

one can make others aware of.

Afflictions, complementary afflictions and power are

the antidotes of the opposing side.

---

Following, accordingly and yet fallible.

Following, being connected and the opposite:

Infallible and fallible.

Following, not being connected is meditation.

---

The reference, mind development and attainments of

bodhisattvas are especially noble.

---

The causal matrix, entrance, preparation, expression of the

result, actions, especially non-actions.

There are the highest and the unsurpassable.

---

Faith, entering, definitely arising, prophecy, expressing,

bestowing authorization, gone, benefiting and

accomplishing actions are taught.

---

There are three aspects in the dharmadhatu:

impure, impure and pure, as well as completely pure;

they are described respectively.

Based upon them and accordingly,

the status of individuals is determined.

---

That which becomes a vessel (and) has perfectly matured.

Influential power, wishes, increasing (abilities)

and perfect purity are the results in subsequent order.

---

Following successively, beginning, becoming accustomed and
perfection.

Following, (what accords) and (what) does not accord.

Freedom (is) special.

Highest and unsurpassable are other results which are briefly

summarised.

---

That was the fourth chapter entitled The Antidotes: The Phases

and Results of Meditation from Distinguishing of the Middle from

the Extremes.

---

The teachings describe as unparalleled: 

The practice, the focus, and the perfect accomplishment.

---

There are six aspects to the practice which accomplishes the

paramitas: what is genuine, mental cultivation, being in accord with

the dharma, discarding extremes, practice with specific focus, and

without a specific focus.

---

The essential character of what is genuine can be expressed in the

twelve aspects of genuine: Vastness, long duration, purpose,

inexhaustibility, continuity, absence of difficulty, mastery,

permeating, striving, attainment, the result in concordance with the

cause, and accomplishment.

---

Because of these twelve ways, the ten paramitas are said 

to have the meaning of being genuine.

---

Generosity, discipline, patience, joyful striving, 

meditative stabilization, higher knowledge, skillful means, 

aspiration prayers, strength, and primordial wisdom. 

These are the ten paramitas.

---

Their functions are: taking care, not harming, forbearance of harm,

increasing positive qualities, ability to lead into the teachings,

bringing to complete liberation, rendering inexhaustible, 

always engaging, making definite, and practicing and bring to maturity.

---

While examining the teachings just as they are put forth in the

mahayana, bodhisattvas at all times cultivate their minds through

the three higher knowledges.

---

Causing the basic constituent to emerge, entering into the meaning,

and the perfect accomplishment of objectives.

---

This mental cultivation is know as perfectly encompassing 

the twelve types of dharma activity.

---

Writing the letters, making offerings, generous giving, listening,

reading, memorizing, explaining, reciting, considering, and

meditating. The essential character of these activities contains

immeasurable merit.

---

Because it is superior

because it does not become exhausted,

because it benefits others without entering 

an inactive state of peace.

---

Practice without distraction and without error

is in accord with the dharma.

---

The wise should know the distractions: drawing out, engaging an

object, accordingly savoring experience, dullness and agitation,

thoughts that believe, mental activity involving ego-clinging, 

and the mentality of the small.

---

Letters, actual meaning, mental activity, not projecting, the two

characters, impure and pure, temporary, no aversion, and no pride.

---

Meaning arises through the connection of letters and through

association. Meaning does not arise without this connection or

without this association. This understanding is unmistaken about

letters.

---

What comes into being as dualistic appearance does not exist in this

way: completely discarding existence and nonexistenceâ€”

This is being unmistaken about the actual meaning.

---

Mental activity involves thoughts that are conditioned by previous

thoughts. Knowing its origin as the cause ofdualistic appearances is

being unmistaken about mental activity.

---

Not existing ultimately and existing are said to resemble an illusion

and so forth.

This understanding is unmistaken about not projecting,

because neither existence nor nonexistence are projected.

---

No concepts apply.

For that reason all phenomena are mere names.

This is being unmistaken about the true character.

It is the true character of the ultimate truth.

---

Not included within the dharamdhatuâ€”

such a phenomenon does no exist.

For that reason, understanding the comprehensive character

in this way is to be unmistaken about it.

---

Depending on whether mistaken mental activity is discarded or not

discarded, an individual is impure or completely pure.

This understanding is also unmistaken about that which 

is pure and impure.

---

Since dharmadhatu is by nature pure it is like space;

the adventitious arises from duality and is not wrong.

---

In the true nature of phenomena and a person,

there is nothing totally afflicted nor completely purified.

Since there is no self-essence, there is no aversion and no pride.

Here this understanding is unmistaken about these two.

---

The extremes of being separate or the same,

the extremes of both the tirthikas and the shravakas,

the two extremes of superimposition or denial in relation to 

either a person or a phenomena,

the extremes of unfavorable conditions and their remedies,

the ideas of permanence and extinction,

and the extremes of a perceived object and a perceiving subject in

relation to the totally afflicted and the completely purified.

There are three aspects to the totally afflicted.

---

The extremes of two concepts are stated in twelve aspects.

---

The existence of an entity and the nonexistence of an entity,

what is to be pacified and what pacifies,

something to be feared and the fearing of it

perceived object and perceiving subject,

what is correct and what is mistaken,

acting as an agent and not acting as an agent,

and not arising and simultaneously present.

These are the extremes related to two concepts.

---

Practices with a special focus and without a special focus are

understood in relation to the ten levels.

---

The focuses are stated as:

The presentation, suchness or the dharmadhatu, what is to be

practiced, the practice (itself), comprehension, definitive

comprehension, perfect comprehension, perfect realization, perfectly

expanding, conceptualization, resting in naturalness, and perfectly

accomplished.

---

Perfect accomplishment embodies:

Nothing missing, not abandoning, not straying, perfect

accomplishment, perfect generation, increasing, completely

workable, not abiding, no obscurations, and no interruption.

---

That was the fifth chapter called The Unsurpassable Vehicle from

Distinguishing the Middle from the Extremes.

---

The Treatise Distinguishing the Middle from Extremes is difficult to

realize and embraces the heart of the teachings.

It brings great benefits, and accordingly, it is meaningful for all

three vehicles.

All that lacks meaning is cleared away.

Sarva Mangalam

---

That concludes The Treatise that Perfectly Differentiates between the

Middle from the Extremes written in verse form by the exalted

Maitreya. It was translated (into Tibetan) by the Indian Khenpos

Dschinamitra and Shilendrabodhi and edited in this form by the big

group of translators Yeshe De.
