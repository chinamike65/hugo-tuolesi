Brief biography of Master Ah Wang Gyatso

On the fifteenth day of the first lunar month in 1969, Ah Wang Gyatso was born in Hainan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture of Qinghai Province. He began his study of Buddhism at the age of six and became a monk at the age of 18. He had seven teachers including Master Gazang Qusong.

These seven masters all were taught by Rako Rinpoche, the greatest Buddhist scholar and great saviour of Tibetan Buddhism in the 20th century, and the transmission of the teachings down through this lineage is very pure and complete.

Master Ah Wang, having followed the precepts of his teachers, received complete transmission of the teachings from his seven masters, the forty-sixth generational heirs of the "Prajna Paramita Sutra", the most important classic of Buddhism. From them he obtained more than 200 kinds of empowerments, more than 300 advanced special empowerments, more than 280 guiding precepts, with more than 500 scriptural sutras and more than 80 oral transmissions of intangible secrets. Therefore, the lineage of the master's doctrinal transmission is extremely complete and especially rare.

His Holiness Dharma Master Yongzeng, who was once the sutra teacher of the living Buddha, Sechi, in Lamodeqin Monastery was a person of superior virtue and the complete holder of the transmissions of the Gelugpa tantric teachings. Master Ah Wang followed Master Yongzeng for more than 20 years and absorbed all of the experience of the Venerable Dharma Master. The other six masters are also highly proficient in the esoteric secrets and have sufficient evidence of exceptional scholarly achievements. 
In addition, Master Ah Wang studied at Qinghai Buddhist College and the Ta'er Monastery  Debating College of Dialectics (Debating College).
With a single-minded commitment to study and wide erudition, he completed the study of sutra and tantra, the five major theories of the five great Dharma masters, well ahead of schedule.

Since arriving at Tuole Temple, Master Ah Wang has been serving as the Abbot (Khenpo), teaching the five courses (Prajñāpāramitā, Madhyamaka, Pramāṇa, Abhidharma, and Vinaya), the Sanshi Dao (Three Stages), and the four continuations of Tantric Buddhism to the monks every day.

Over the past two decades, four universities including the Debating School of Buddhist Classics have been established, 9 batches of 154 Buddhist Geshes have been trained, and the amplification of the Sangha continues.

At present, under the guidance of Master Ah Wang, Tuole Temple adheres to the Gelug traditions, strictly holds to its pure precepts, and is rigorous and profound in learning style. It is well-known in Tibetan areas. In recent years, students from Tuole Temple were all among the best Scholars at the Province-wide Scriptural Debate Conference.

While cultivating the younger monks' talents, the master never forgets to learn and practice, and follows the Three Stages seriously, insisting on a personal two-month retreat every year.

At the beginning of 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the master went into retreat twice and recited the Mantra of Parnashavari a million times, and a million times the Six-Character Great Bright Mantra (Auṃ maṇi padme hūṃ), and prayed to all the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas, for all the people of the world.

Before His Holiness Yongzeng passed away, he once instructed Master Ah Wang: "You must devote your whole life to the cause of turning the wheel of Dharma and spreading the Teachings to benefit the lives of all people."

Master Ah Wang takes the last wishes of his teacher very seriously, and often teaches followers the Buddhist scriptures, transmits precepts, and lectures on the teachings of the Three Stages.

From 2009 to 2019, at the invitation of the Macau Buddhist community, Master Ah Wang, as the representative of Tibetan Buddhist monks, directed and performed the religious ceremonies for the 10th, 15th and 20th anniversary of the return of Macau.

In October 2015, Master Ah Wang was invited to deliver a keynote speech at the Chongsheng International Forum sponsored by the Yunnan Buddhist Association and Dali Chongsheng Temple.

Master Ah Wang was deeply influenced by the 10th Panchen Lama and advocated that Buddhist disciples should show concern for all people, have the "three loves" in their hearts, and follow the "four practices" in order to achieve the harmony and fulfillment of the "five great wishes".

On this basis, an ideological system of inheritance, strong foundation, practice, and promotion of Buddhism has gradually formed: In knowledge transmission, it strives to preserve the original texts, protect their purity and purity of the Dharma lineage, and promote the teachings without adding any unrelated understanding or commentary. This work is unending and continuous.

We think, that from a worldly point of view, Buddhism should be adapted for Chinese culture, modernized, popularized, and practiced.

In Buddhist practice, exoteric Buddhism and esoteric Buddhism should be combined, and these teachings should also joined with practical cultivation.

For the promotion of Buddhism, we need to encourage innovation, advance with the times, and respond to new challenges and opportunities. It is necessary to strictly adhere to the inherited texts and teachings, but also to continuously innovate new ways of dissemination.

Among them, the most important is the establishment of Buddhism in the world. A focus on adaptation for Chinese society is the most basic starting point. Belief that is detached from the state is rootless and unstable. In addition, faithful adherence by believers will also promote social stability and national harmony. In terms of moving with the times, the Master believes that Buddhism must modernize, remove the outdated parts, and highlight the practical guiding significance of the Buddha's teaching.

In terms of popularization, the spread of Buddhism must be practical, easy to understand, and truly become a guide for people's lives and work. In terms of practice, all Buddhist doctrines and scriptures should be made vivid, concrete, practical, easy to follow, and through practice to prove the validity of objective logic and the laws of the universe revealed by Buddhist teachings.

Master Ah Wang is not only successful in his mental cultivation and his debating skills, but he is also the author of a rich body of writings. His works include "Prajna Paramita Sutra Notes", "Sanshidao - Three Stages - Oral Teachings of the Masters of the Three Schools", the "Fahai Treasures" series and so on. His writings are concise and to the point, with in-depth analysis and thorough examination of many topics, and are acclaimed and respected by many Buddhist scholars at home and abroad.

This series of books analyzes many problems of modern life in easy-to-understand language, with vivid examples, and presents highly effective solutions. They provide a very effective and practical plan for people who wish to have a happy and fulfilling life. Real guiding significance.

In the book "Quotations of Wisdom", the master uses witty and clear language, from simple examples to more profound ideas, resonating with the depths of their souls.

Master Ah Wang said that it does not matter whether the teachings come from Theravada Buddhism, Mahayana Buddhism, or Tibetan Buddhism, they are all the Buddha's righteous Dharma. They all teach enlightenment and Buddhahood, and they all have something very extraordinary to contribute.

Buddhists should go deep into the scriptures, be diligent in Listening, Contemplation, and Practice, and establish a Right View; At the same time, they should cultivate bodhicitta (compassion) and truly consider all living beings, so as to achieve a fulfilling life for themselves.
