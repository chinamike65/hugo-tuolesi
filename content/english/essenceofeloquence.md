Thus, the discriminating should exert themselves
in the techniques for realizing Thatness.  

This depends on the discrimination between the interpretable meaning and
the definitive meaning of the teachings of the Victor.

It is not possible to discriminate between these two
on scriptural authority alone, on some statement such as
"This is interpretable meaning, and this definitive
meaning."  

Otherwise, the Champions' elaboration of
explanations of the problem of discrimination between
interpretable and definitive would have been pointless.

Further, many different interpretations of interpretable
and definitive have been declared in the Scriptures themselves.  

Finally, since it cannot be established
by referring to scriptural statements alone, as, in
general, no such statement would be valid in every
case, neither can it be established by a mere
(scriptural) statement in any particular case.


The Champions of Philosophy, foretold to discern
the interpretable and the definitive in the
teachings, elucidated their inner meaning.  

Hence, we must seek that meaning by following their
determinations (established) by reasonings which
fault alternative interpretations of definitive
meaning Scriptures proving their definiteness
as uninterpretable meaning.  

Thus, ultimately, we must discriminate with impeccable reasoning.

Should we accept theories violating reason, their
teacher could not become the personification of
validating cognition. 

For, even the ultimate reality of things includes means of proof through
logically established reasoning. 

Seeing the ramifications of this, the Sensible Lord (declared):

Bhikshus, just as a goldsmith gets his gold,

First testing by melting, cutting, and rubbing,

Sages accept my teachings after full examination

And not just out of devotion (to me).

##### INQUIRY TO RESOLVE CONTRADICTIONS

(Paramarthasamudgata) states, in the Elucidation of Intention Scripture

The Lord proclaims  in many discourses the
intrinsic identity of the aggregates, their
characteristics of production and destruction,
their abandonment, and full understanding. 

As with the aggregates, so does He proclaim the twelve
media, the dependent origination, and the four
foods. 

Thus does He proclaim the intrinsic identity,
the thorough knowledge, the abandonment, the
realization, and the meditation of the Four Holy
Truths; 

the intrinsic identity, variety, plurality,
abandonment and full understanding of the elements;

and the intrinsic identities, resistances, remedies,
initial productions, maintenances, preservations,
developments, and increases of the thirty-seven
accessories of enlightenment.  

On the other hand, the Lord also proclaims the intrinsic unreality,
non-production, non-cessation, primordial peace,
and natural total liberation of all things. 

I wonder about this and earnestly inquire of the Lord
the actual meaning of His proclamation of the
intrinsic unreality, non-production, non-cessation,
primordial peace, and natural, total liberation of all things.

There is verbal contradiction between the
statements in some Scriptures that all things are
devoid of intrinsic reality and those of others
that proclaim the intrinsic identity, etc., of the
aggregates, etc. 

Yet, the Scriptures should be free of contradictions.  
Hence, (Paramarthasamudgata) inquires
into the intended meaning of the declarations of intrinsic
unreality, thereby also inquiring by implication into
the intended meaning of the declarations of intrinsic
identity, etc.


Here, it is not correct to interpret "intrinsic
identity" as the Great Chinese Commentary does,
as "distinctive characteristic." 

The Scripture itself,
in the section on the imagined nature, clearly
explains it to refer to "intrinsically identifiable
status."  Furthermore, (if it were "distinctive
characteristic"), it would entail the logical fallacy
that the explanation of the imagined nature as
"identity-unreality" would be invalid, since there
are distinctive characteristics even in things of
imagined nature.


Although other commentaries explain the "variety" and
"plurality" of elements otherwise, we may take them
to refer to the eighteen elements and the six elements,
respectively, considering their subsequent occurrence
in the Scripture.  "Preservation" means not forgetting.


##### ANSWER RESOLVING THE CONTRADICTION

##### THE INTERPRETATION OF UNREALITY INTENDED BY SUCH DECLARATIONS

##### BRIEF STATEMENT

In the Elucidation of Intention, (the Buddha)
teaches intrinsic unreality, intending the three unrealities:

Paramarthasamudgata!  I teach the intrinsic
unreality of all things 

intending the following three types
of such unreality:  

identity-unreality, 

production-unreality,

and ultimate unreality.

In the Compendium, (Asanga) states:

With what intention does the Lord declare the
unreality of all things?  

He declares it wherever
necessary to train (disciples), intending the three types
of such unreality.

Also, in the Thirty, (Vasubandhu) states:

The intrinsic unreality of all things is taught
intending the three types of unreality of the three
types of reality.

Therefore, anyone who maintains that
the statements of the intrinsic unreality of all things,
in Scriptures such as the Transcendent Wisdom, intend
all superficial things and do not intend the absolute,
contradicts the Elucidation and the treatises of
Aryasanga and Vasubandhu, and also departs from the system
of the Holy Father and Son.

##### DETAILED EXPLANATION 

 The inquiry into the intention of the statement of
intrinsic unreality asks both the intention in declaring
unreality and the actual mode of unreality, and the answer
deals with both in order.

  To explain the first, (the
Buddha) collected all the statements of unreality or
identitylessness  with regard to all different
categories of things, from form to omniscience, into
three unrealities, intending that the explanation of
their mode of unreality be easy to understand, since
all superficial and ultimate things are contained within
these three.  

However, even considering such a technique
(of the Buddha), who is there in his right mind who
would say that the ultimate was not included among the
things declared to be unreal, when the Mother Scripture
, etc., declared that all things, such as the five
aggregates, the twelve media, and the eighteen elements,
are non-existent, identityless, unreal, and particularly
mentions the intrinsic unreality of all the synonyms of
the absolute, such as "emptiness," the "ultimate element,"
and "reality," etc.? 

 To answer the second aspect of the question, i.e., the
mode of unreality, as one might wonder what are the three
unrealities that contain all things, said to be
intrinsically unreal, and what is their mode of unreality,
let us explain the first.

In the Elucidation,(the Buddha) declares:

What is the identity-unreality of
things?  

It is the imaginatively constructed nature.

Why?  

It is a nature established by names and
symbolisms, and is not substantiated by intrinsic
identity.

Therefore, it is called "identity-unreality." 
  
 The first question and answer equates
the imagined nature with identity-unreality.

  Giving reasons
for that, He states the affirmative reason that it is
established by names and conventions, and the negative
reason that it is not established by means of any
intrinsic identity.

  The following two unrealities
should be understood by a similar breakdown into
affirmative and negative reasons.


 The identity-reality which does not exist in the
imagined is interpreted as establishment or existence
by intrinsic identity.

  Here, the criterion for existence
or non-existence with intrinsic identity (respectively)
is whether (something) is established independent of,
or dependent upon names and symbolic conventions.

  This
system of interpretation, wherein (nominal) establishment
is not concomitant with existence, is in radical
disagreement with the (system) of the Dialecticist
Centrists, wherein existents are established (precisely)
on the strength of nominal conventions.
  
  Thus, the two
systems disagree also on the meaning of existence and
non-existence with intrinsic identity.
  
  Nevertheless,
when we hold to the existence with intrinsic identity
of this (system), we also hold to the establishment
with intrinsic identity of the Dialecticists; and
there are some cases wherein it is not so held
according to the former, and yet it is so held
according to the latter.

 In regard to the second unreality, in the Elucidation,
(the Buddha) declares:

What is the production-unreality of
things?  

It is the relative nature of things.

  Why so?

Production (of something) occurs by force of other
conditions, and not by that thing's own nature.

Therefore, it is called "production-unreality."
 
 Actual production, or real production,
being nonexistent in the relative, is production
(of a thing) by itself, mentioned in the phrase
"not by that thing's own nature."  

It is equivalent
to independent production.

  As (Asanga) states in
the Compendium:  

"Because created things are
dependently originated, they are produced by influence
of conditions, and not from themselves.
  This is called 'production-unreality.' " 
  
 Thus, this system declares the unreality of such real
production in the relative, yet does not declare its
unreality to be due to non-establishment with intrinsic
identity.

 There are two interpretations of the third unreality,
the first of which establishes ultimate-unreality in the
relative.  

The Elucidation statement (is):

What is the ultimate unreality of
things?  

Those dependently originated things which
are unreal because of ultimate-unreality.

  Why so?

Paramarthasamudgata!  I teach that, among things, the
ultimate is the pure object and, since the relative
nature is not the pure object, it is called "ultimate-unreality."

 The relative is called "ultimate-unreality"
because it does not exist in the ultimate reality.
  
  For,
if we objectify the ultimate and meditate on it, defilements
will come to an end, but if we objectify the relative and
meditate on it, we cannot purify ourselves of the
defilements.

 In that case, why not interpret the imagined also as
ultimate unreality?

 Although this would be appropriate, insofar as the imagined
is not the pure object either, still, only the relative is
established as ultimate-unreality and not the imagined,
because of the power of the relative when objectified
to stop erroneous constructive thought.

 Why?  Although there is no such doubt with regard to the
imagined, the following doubt is liable to arise (with
regard to the relative):  "If it is acknowledged that
defilements are purified through meditation that
objectifies the relative as being empty of the imagined,
then, as we take the so-qualified relative as object,
it becomes the 'pure object' and hence becomes the
ultimate." 

 Furthermore, the suspected fallacy (of relative amounting
to the ultimate) has no bearing, just as there is no
contradiction between the fact that the conviction
of sound's impermanence abolishes the holding of sound
as permanent and the fact that the contemplation of
sound itself does not abolish the sense of permanence.

Also, although the relative is not established as the
ultimate, when the ultimate is taken to be the pure object,
the question of its establishment as another sort of
ultimate will be explained below.


 In regard to the second interpretation of the ultimate
unreality, the Elucidation statement is:
Furthermore, the perfect nature of
things is called "ultimate-unreality."  Why?
Paramarthasamudgata! The objective selflessness of
things is called their "unreality."  
It is the ultimate,
manifest by the fact of the intrinsic unreality of all
things. Therefore, it is called "ultimate-unreality."
 
 The perfect, the objective selflessness
of things, is the pure object, and hence also the ultimate.
It is manifest in the unreality of the selves of things,
and, because it is established  by that fact alone, it
is called "the intrinsic unreality of things," and hence
the "ultimate-unreality."

 (The Buddha) also declares, (elsewhere) in the Elucidation:

"If the nature of the conditional and the nature of the ultimate
were different, then the mere selflessness and the mere
unreality of conditional (things) would not be the nature
of the absolute." 

 Furthermore, in the section on the examples in (the
Elucidation), (Buddha) states that (the ultimate)
is established as (mere) selflessness, just as space is
established as mere formlessness.
  Hence, it is extremely
clear that the perfect, the objective selflessness, is
established as the absolute negation of mental fabrication,
which is just the negation of the objective self in the case
of conditional (things).

  Therefore, the belief that this
Scripture's teaching of the import of reality is definitive
in meaning is contradictory to the belief in the independent
status, i.e., reached without exclusion of a mentally
objectified negatee, of an immutable perfect, which is not
interpreted as an exclusive negative, a mere exclusion
of negatee.

 This system calls the perfect the "ultimate-unreality of
things," because it is the mere negation of the self-actuality
of things, and does not believe it to be unreal because
of a lack of intrinsically identifiable status of the
actual negation itself.


##### EXPOSITION OF EXAMPLES

 In regard to the examples illustrating the three
unrealities, the Elucidation statement is:

The identity-unreality should be
regarded as being like a sky-flower.

  Paramarthasamudgata!
Production-unreality should be regarded as being like a
magical creation, as should the first of the two
ultimate-unrealities.

  Paramarthasamudgata! Just as space
is manifest through the mere absence of form and is
all-pervasive, so the other ultimate-unreality should
be regarded as manifest through objective selflessness
and as all-pervasive.

 The likening of the imagined to a
flower of the sky illustrates the fact that it is merely
an imaginative construction, and does not illustrate
its non-existence among objects of knowledge.

The way in which the relative is like illusion will be
explained below, and the meaning of the simile for
the perfect is self-evident.

 Thus the mode of unreality intended by such statements is
explained.

  If unreality is explained otherwise, i.e., as the
non-establishment with intrinsic identity of all three natures,
it is (a case of) insistence on the literal meaning of the
Scriptures declaring unreality.

  Thereby we adopt either
nihilism or annihilism, since repudiation of all three natures
brings us to the view of meaninglessness.

  Thus, in this
system, if the relative were not established with intrinsic
identity, it would be repudiated, since production and cessation
would be impossible, and if the perfect were not established
with intrinsic identity, it could not serve as the ground
of things.

 Here, we might suppose that, although the view of lack
of intrinsically identifiable status might be allowed to
represent repudiation of the latter two natures, how
could it involve repudiation of the imagined?

 The reason is that the latter two natures would become
non-existent if not established with intrinsic identity,
hence the imagined also would become totally non-existent,
deprived of its basis of designation and designative
conventions (themselves partaking of the relative nature).

 Furthermore, (the Buddha also declares) in the Elucidation:

They do not understand correctly the
profound authenticity of my intentional instructions:  

"All these things are only unreal.

All these things are only unproduced.

All these things are only unceased, only
primordially peaceful, only naturally liberated!"  

Although
they admire that teaching, they are obsessed with its literal
meaning only, and from that basis, they arrive at the view
of nothingness and meaninglessness in all things.

Having
gotten these views of nothingness and meaninglessness,
they repudiate all the natures in all things.
  They
repudiate the imagined nature of things, as well as their
relative and perfect natures.
  Why?  Paramarthasamudgata!
The imagined nature can be known when the relative and
perfect natures exist.

  But those who see identitylessness
in the relative and perfect natures repudiate the imagined
nature also.

  Therefore, they are said to repudiate all
three natures.

 This system believes that "literal
insistence" means to accept as taught the statements
from the Scriptures that teach intrinsic unreality,
such as "All things are ultimately devoid of reality,
devoid of essential nature, and devoid of intrinsic
identity."

 "To see identitylessness in the relative and perfect
natures" means to view them both as not established
with intrinsic identity, and from "why" on, he teaches
the reason this becomes repudiation of all three natures.

If one takes literally the declarations of non-existence
of production and cessation with intrinsic identity,
then the relative is repudiated; and it can be seen
(easily) how this becomes repudiation of the other
two natures as well.

  For in this system, production and
cessation, if they are not established with intrinsic
identity, must therefore be non-existent.

##### THE INTENTION OF THE DECLARATION OF PRODUCTIONLESSNESS
 If such is the mode of unreality, with what intention
does he declare non-production, etc.?  

This is declared
intending the first and last unreality.
  In regard to the
first, the Elucidation statement is:
I teach all things to be unproduced, unceased,
primordially peaceful, and naturally liberated, intending
the fact of identity-unreality.
  Why?  Paramarthasamudgata!
What does not exist with intrinsic identity is not produced.

What is not produced does not cease.  What is not produced
and does not cease, that is originally peaceful.
  What is
originally peaceful, that is naturally liberated.
  And,
as for the naturally liberated, there is not the slightest
thing to be done for its liberation.


 By setting forth lack of intrinsically
identifiable status as the reason for the non-existence
of production and cessation in the imagined, He teaches
that for production and cessation to exist they must be
established with intrinsic identity, and hence that
production and cessation are established with intrinsic
identity in the relative.  Because freedom from production
and cessation, being the uncreated, cannot possibly belong
to the totally addictive realm, He teaches "primordial
peace" and "natural liberation," since it is free from
addiction.

 In regard to the final unreality, the Elucidation
statement is:
Again, I teach all things to be unproduced,
unceased, primordially peaceful, and naturally liberated,
intending the fact of ultimate unreality as manifest
through objective selflessness.
  Why?  This ultimate unreality
manifest through objective selflessness subsists alone,
eternally and permanently.
  It is the uncreated essence of
things, free of all emotional addictions.
  And because it is
free of all addictions, it is originally peaceful and
naturally liberated.

 The Great Chinese Commentary explains
that "eternally" refers to the infinite past, and that
"permanently" refers to the infinite future.
 Here, one might well wonder about the meaning of thus
neglecting  to take the middle unreality as the basis of
non-production, etc., since all three (natures) have already
been taken as the basis of unreality.

  Furthermore, what does (Asanga) mean by explaining non-production, etc., in
terms of all three natures, in the Abhidharma Synthesis?

Because of the identity-unreality of the
imagined nature, the production-unreality of the relative,
and the ultimate-unreality of the perfect, things are said
to be unproduced, unceased, originally peaceful, and
naturally liberated.
  With what intention?  (The intention
is that) without intrinsic reality, there is no production,
without production, there is no cessation, and without
cessation and production, there is original peace, and
natural, total liberation.

 The Great Chinese Commentary explains
that the Scripture does not declare the relative as the
intended basis of productionlessness, etc., in order to
show that dependent origination is not without purpose.

And the Abhidharma Synthesis explanation (of
non-production in the relative) is in terms of the
non-existence of production from self and of production
without cause.  Since there are production and cessation
established with intrinsic identity in the relative,
the declaration of the non-existence of production and cessation
does not intend the relative.  And since most of the relative
is included in the totally addicted, it is the intention of
this Scripture not to make it the basis of the latter two
expressions.
 
 Thus the Synthesis explanation
intends that, as there is no intrinsic reality, interpreted
as the types of reality excluded in each of the three
natures, so there is no production and no cessation,
and so also there is primordial peace and natural liberation.


##### DESCRIPTION OF THE THREE NATURES
 Granted that the imagined nature is equivalent to
identity-unreality, what is it in itself?  The Elucidation
statement is:
The imaginatively constructed nature is
the establishment by names and conventions of substantive
natures such as "form-aggregate," etc., and qualitative
natures, such as "production of the form-aggregate," or
"cessation of the form-aggregate," or "the form-aggregate
is abandoned and fully known," etc., in conditional processes,
which are the ground of the imagined nature, and the object
of constructive thought.

 The last three expressions, from
"conditional" to "thought," refer to the designative base
of the imagined, and the rest (of the quotation) describes
the process of imaginative construction.  The processes of
"substantive" (or ascriptive) designation, such as "this is
the form-aggregate," and of "qualitative," or descriptive
designation, such as "the form-aggregate is produced,"
will be explained in detail (below).

 Granted the relative is equivalent to production-unreality,
what is it in itself?  The Elucidation statement is:
"The relative nature consists of conditional processes,
which are the ground of the imagined nature, and the object
of imaginative construction." 

The first phrase shows
its own actuality, the second, that it is the designative
base of the imagined, and the third, of what it is object.

 Granted the perfect is ultimate unreality, what is it in
itself?  The Elucidation statement is:
The perfect nature is that very same
conditional process, the ground of the imagined nature
and object of imaginative construction, as it is
intrinsically lacking precisely in the reality (attributed
to it) in the imagined nature, which is not established
therein; which is the objective selflessness, the ultimate
reality, and the pure object.

 Here, the perfect is described as the "objective
selflessness," or "ultimate reality," which, when objectified
and meditated upon, will purify defilements.
  What is "objective
selflessness?"  It is the fact of intrinsic unreality, also
called "actuality."  Of what is the reality non-existent?

"Precisely in the reality" indicates the above-mentioned
imagined nature, the word "precisely" excluding anything else.
Hence, this means that the perfect is not taken as the unreality
of the other two natures, but precisely as the unreality of
the imagined nature alone.
 The first part of the quotation, from "conditional process" to
"construction," indicates the relative as that which is empty,
and "the imagined nature not established therein" makes it very
clear that the perfect is the emptiness of the relative with
respect to the imagined.
  Hence, the belief that this
Scripture's teachings are definitive in meaning is contradictory
to the belief that the perfect is the emptiness of the last
reality with respect to the first two realities.

 In regard to the mode of emptiness, the existence of something
possibly existent elsewhere is not negated, as in the case of
an area devoid of a pot, but the relative is empty of the
establishment of the imagined, as in the case of a person's
being empty of substantial existence.  Thus, the Scripture
declares, "the imagined nature.
which is not established
therein."

 In regard to the "imagined" which is negated, the reason
why this Scripture does not mention any imagined other than
that of ascriptive and descriptive designation, on both
occasions of description of the imagined, will be explained
below.

 Just as they are applied to the form-aggregate, the three
natures are stated to apply to each of the other four
aggregates, the twelve media, the twelve links of dependent
origination, the four foods, the six elements and the eighteen
elements.

  As for the Holy Truth of Suffering, its designative
base is the same as above, its imagined nature is established
by names and symbolic conventions, ascriptively as "truth of
suffering," and descriptively as "realization of the truth
of suffering," its relative nature is as above, and its
perfect nature is as above, with the statement that it is
"unreality with respect to the (imagined) reality only."

Likewise, (the three natures) apply to the other Holy Truths.

Also, they are  applied to the seven divisions of the accessories of
enlightenment, the designative base as before, the imagined
being ascriptive (designations), such as "perfect concentration,"
and descriptive (designations), such as "its resistance,"
"its remedy," etc., and their other two realities being stated
as in the case of the Truth of Suffering.
  All of these are
recited by Paramarthasamudgata to the Teacher to affirm his
understanding of the explanation of the three unrealities
that intends the method of presenting the three natures of
each thing, from the form-aggregate to the components of
the path, mentioned in the inquiry resolving contradictions
above.

4. INQUIRY INTO THE MEANING THUS ESTABLISHED

##### EXPOSITION OF THE ELUCIDATION OF INTENTION
 There are three types of Scriptures:  those that teach
that things are existent by intrinsic identity; those that
teach that things are not established by intrinsic identity;
and those that show fine discrimination between establishment
and non-establishment by intrinsic identity.
  Thus, there are
two types according to whether or not they discriminate between
existence and non-existence of intrinsic reality.
  The
discriminating (Scriptures) are definitive in meaning, as they
cannot be interpreted otherwise, and the non-discriminating
are interpretable in meaning, since they must be interpreted
otherwise.  Thus, by implication from the above explanations,
we can understand that two types of Scriptures are interpretable
in meaning, and one type is definitive in meaning.

 (Now,) Paramarthasamudgata asks the Teacher how this implicit
result should be applied to determine the interpretable and
the definitive among the three wheels (of Dharma) 47
 in the
context of their temporal sequentiality.
  The Elucidation
statement is:
First of all, the Lord, 

in the Deer Park at
Rshipatana in Varanasi, 

for the sake of those involved in the
disciple-vehicle, 

turned a wonderful, amazing wheel of Dharma,

such as had never before been turned in the world by men or
gods, 

by showing the aspects of the Four Holy Truths.

Nevertheless, even that wheel of Dharma turned by the Lord
was surpassable, provisory, interpretable in meaning,
and disputable.
Then, the Lord, for the sake of those involved in
the Universal Vehicle, 

turned a second wheel of Dharma,

even more wonderful and amazing, 

by proclaiming emptiness,
starting from the fact of the unreality, 

productionlessness,
ceaselessness, primordial peace, and natural liberation of
all things.


  Nevertheless, even this wheel of Dharma was
surpassable, provisory, interpretable, and disputable.
Then, the Lord, for the sake of those involved in all
vehicles, 

turned the third wheel of Dharma, 
by showing full
discrimination, 

starting from the fact of the unreality,

productionlessness, ceaselessness, primordial peace, and
natural liberation of all things.

  And this turning of the
wheel of Dharma by the Lord is unsurpassed, not provisory,
definitive in meaning, and leaves no grounds for dispute.

##### PARTIAL EXPLANATION OF ITS MEANING
##### VERBAL MEANING
 Yuan Tsho explains:
In regard to the turning of the first wheel,
the first phrase indicates its location, the second, its
disciples, and from "turned" to "Truths" describes the
wheel itself.
  "Aspects of the Four Holy Truths" indicates
the principal subject.
  "Wonderful" is praise.  "Nevertheless"
indicates it is not definitive.  "Surpassable" indicates a
specific teaching above it.
  "Provisory" indicates that it
is a teaching valid for specific occasions.
  It is
"interpretable," because it deals with existence and not
with emptiness.

  "Disputable" indicates its rebuttal by
other (teachings), and its serving as basis for the
arguments between the sectarians of the Disciple Vehicle.
 That is, the Scripture means:  by
"surpassable," that beyond it there is another definitive
meaning; by "provisory," that if its meaning is taken
literally as taught, it gives rise to criticism from others,
such a meaning further indicated by the alternate translation,
"with inherent opposition," given by the Chinese Commentary;
by "interpretable," that the meaning must be otherwise interpreted;
and  by "disputable," that there are contrary arguments, since
the Teacher did not explicate the meaning as "it is thus.
"
 In regard to the second wheel, from "starting" to "things"
shows the principal subject.
  "For the sake," etc., shows the disciples for whom the wheel was turned.
  
  Some commentaries
explain "by proclaiming emptiness" as meaning the teaching
of objective selflessness, but the Chinese Commentary
gives also an alternative reading, "by unmanifest aspect,"
the meaning of which is stated to be "hidden"  This alternative
translation is also correct, as the two latter wheels are shown
to be similar in having realitylessness as their principal
subject and different in their teaching procedures.
  The middle
wheel does not discriminate between existence and non-existence
of realities, hence "by unmanifest aspect," and the final wheel
does so discriminate, hence "showing full discrimination"  Taking
this (middle) wheel in comparison with the third wheel, the
Tripitaka Master Yuan Tsho explains no more than "surpassable,"
and, although he cites the explanation of the Indian Master,
Paramartha, I do not quote it, since it does not seem apt.
  My
interpretation is like the former (Master's, i.e., Yuan Tsho).

 Yuan Tsho explains:
In regard to the third wheel, its principal
subject is the same as that of the middle wheel.
  The disciples
of the first two wheels were those of the Individual Vehicle
and Universal Vehicle respectively, and both were included in
the final wheel, hence, "for the sake of those involved in all
vehicles."  "Full discrimination" refers to the previously
explained application of the three natures to each thing
such as form, etc., and to the according differentiation of
three modes of unreality.
  The "this" in "this turning"
refers to the just-mentioned wheel of full discrimination,
i.e., the Elucidation of Intention, and other Scriptures
of equally full discrimination, and does not refer to
(the other wheels,) whose Scriptures do not thus discriminate
between the intrinsically real and unreal.
  "Unsurpassed," etc., indicates the greatness of this wheel, it being
supremely wonderful, none other excelling it.

  "Not provisory"
means that there is no later occasion when it is refuted.

"Definitive in meaning" means that it shows accurately what
exists and what does not, and hence it does not "leave any
grounds for dispute."

 Yuan Tsho's explanation here agrees with mine,
being just the reverse of my previous explanations of the
(opposite terms) such as "surpassable," except in the case of
(our explanations of "provisory") and "not provisory"
(respectively).

  (I understand this qualification as
referring to the fact that) the discourses of the former
two (wheels) give occasion to the criticism of their literal
meanings, and the final wheel does not, because their
literal meanings (respectively) do and do not require
interpretation.

  (Finally,) as to the question of
"disputability," ("indisputable") means that there are no
grounds for analytical dispute by experts as to whether
or not the meaning of a Scripture (of the wheel in question)
is determined according to its teaching of (either) intrinsic
reality (or) lack of intrinsic reality; it does not indicate
that other sorts of disputes are impossible.

##### PARTIAL EXPLANATION OF THE RULE OF INTERPRETABLE-DEFINITIVE

 The Chinese Commentary calls the first wheel
"the wheel of Dharma of the Four Holy Truths," 
the second,
"the wheel of Dharma of identitylessness," 
and the third,
"the wheel of Dharma of determination of the ultimate,"
or else, to accord with this very Scripture, "the wheel
of Dharma of fine discrimination."

 According to the way in which this Scripture formulates
interpretable and definitive, there are two categories of
teachings, discriminating and undiscriminating, and the
grounds on which a Scripture is classified (as one or the
other) is whether it states invariably that things have
intrinsically identifiable reality, whether it states that
there is nowhere such a reality, or whether it discriminates
explicitly between existence and non-existence of such a
reality (in particular things).

  According to the above
explanation, this is made very clear in the "inquiry
resolving contradictions" in the Scripture, the answer given,
the statement of the mode of explanation of intrinsic
unreality that intends the application of the three natures
to each of all things, and the statement of the interpretable
and definitive among the Scriptures taught at different times.

 Thus, the first wheel is shown to be interpretable in its
statement of the existence of intrinsic identity in things,
beginning with the Four Truths, and not merely in its being
taught among the Buddha's earliest teachings.
  For example,
there is no need to clear up any doubts about the (status) of
such precepts as that first stated to the ascetics at
Benares:  "Make your lower robe circular!"

 Similarly, the second wheel consists of the statements of
intrinsic realitylessness.

  There is no need to demonstrate
the interpretability of other Scriptures of that time-period
which are not concerned with realitylessness, as the doubt
mentioned in the inquiry resolving contradictions does not
arise from them.

 The third wheel, while explained to be definitive in meaning,
consists of statements of explicit discrimination as explained
above, and not of every teaching given during that time-period.

This is abundantly clear from the Scripture itself.
  For example,
the brief Discipline taught at the Parinirvana was declared at
the very end (of the Buddha's life), yet is not classified as
definitive in meaning by this Scripture.
 What does this Scripture seek to establish by thus differentiating
between interpretable and definitive?  It seeks to teach disciples
not to take literally teachings which do not specifically
discriminate between things, but (categorically declare them
all) either to be established by intrinsic identity, or not
to be so established.

  For, although the imaginatively
constructed is not established by intrinsic identity, the other
two realities are indeed so established.
  Thus the Scripture
seeks to teach the disciples that emptiness, which is the
relative devoid of the imagined, is the final ultimate and
the goal of the path.

  Therefore, the first two wheels
(of Dharma) are stated to be interpretable in meaning, and
the final wheel to be definitive.
 Some people believe, relying on this Scripture, that, as all
Scriptures promulgated in the third time-period must be
definitive in meaning, certain statements (about the
"Buddha-essence") made to educate the heterodox who were
fascinated by soul-theories, must be taken literally.

Thus, they believe that the above-mentioned "fine
discrimination" means the discrimination between the
truth-status of the ultimate nature and the truthlessness
of all things possessing that nature, which are not
intrinsically real in the slightest, merely being postulated
by the erroneous intellect.

 There are still others who imagine that, if discrimination
between interpretable and definitive were determined by this
Scripture, the implication (advocated by those) above would
follow.

  Hence, they refute this Scripture, saying that its
rule of interpretable-definitive is not to be taken
literally.
  Both of these (types of scholars) appear to be
arguing from a merely casual discrimination between
interpretable and definitive, without examining in detail
the inquiry resolving contradictions, the way the Teacher
answers it, and the formulation of the interpretable-definitive
(rule) that is based upon them.

#### CHAPTER II
##### EXPLANATIONS OF THE SUTRA STATEMENTS
##### MASTER ASANGA'S CHIEF RELIANCE ON THE ELUCIDATION OF INTENTION

 In the Compendium, Aryasanga commends the
"ultimate" chapter of the Elucidation:  "Know the
ultimate, with its five characteristics, as described in
the Elucidation of Intention!" 

  He commends the
"nature" chapter as teaching the three natures:  "View
the nature of things as described in the Elucidation of
Intention!" 

  He also quotes from the Scripture the
inquiry resolving contradictions, and commends the
"realitylessness" chapter as teaching interpretable-definitive:
"View the nature of the realitylessness of things as
described in the Elucidation of Intention!" 

 Also he cites the Elucidation statements about the
eightfold group of consciousnesses and about final
genealogical determinism.

 In the "reality" chapter of
the Boddhisattva Stages, in its commentaries, and in
the Universal Vehicle Compendium, he determines, with
a variety of explanations, the Elucidation statement
(set forth in Chapter I above) that the relative being
empty of the imaginatively constructed, which is ascriptive
and descriptive designation, is the perfect.
  Finally, the
explanations of the meaning of reality in the Ornament
of Universal Vehicle Scriptures and the Center and
Extremes, etc., and the essential points taught in their
commentaries, are very much in agreement with the meaning
of this Scripture.

  Therefore, the determination of the
meaning of this Scripture appears to be fundamental to
his system.

##### PROCEDURES TO DETERMINE REALITY ON THAT BASIS
##### GENERAL PROCEDURE TO ELIMINATE TWO EXTREMES
##### EXPLANATION IN THE BODHISATTVA STAGES
##### PATTERNS OF VIEWS WHICH REIFY AND REPUDIATE

 (Asanga) states, in the Bodhisattva Stages:

"How is (reality) discovered?  It is discovered by the
avoidance of the misapprehension which reifies what does
not exist and the misapprehension which repudiates what
does exist."

What are "reification" and "repudiation,"
as mentioned here?  The Bodhisattva Stages gives their
definitions:

(Reification) is the habitual conviction
arising from the reification of an intrinsic identity,
(actually) inexistent, which is a reality posed by verbal
designation of substances such as the formful and of
things such as form.

(Repudiation) is the repudiation of authentic actuality,
saying "it does not exist at all, anywhere," although it
exists ultimately with an inexpressible nature, and serves
as support and basis of designative verbal signs.

It should be recognized that these two ruinous
activities are utterly destructive of our religious
discipline! 

 The first two parts of this quote describe
the two (mental patterns), and from "it should be recognized"
on, it shows how they ruin the profound Universal Vehicle
teaching.

From "actuality" to "forms" indicates the designative base of the imaginatively constructed.

"Reality posed  by verbal designation" is the "reality" verbally
designated, and not the designative word itself, as the Compendium clearly explains.

 Other passages in the Bodhisattva Stages are to be
understood in the same way; that "reification" is the
conviction that the verbally designated reality has intrinsic
identity, when in fact it does not exist by intrinsic identity;
that the basis of designative verbal signs, i.e., their
support, is the designative base of the imagined; and that
"repudiation" is the notion that this same (relative), which
is ultimately existent in an inexpressible way, does not exist
at all anywhere.

  Thus, "reification" is the notion that the
imagined exists ultimately, "repudiation" is the notion that
the other two natures do not exist ultimately.

  For, the
first (reality) exists (only) superficially, and the
other two do exist ultimately.

 While, in order to parallel the explanation of "repudiation"
as the view of the inexistence of the ultimately existent,
"reification" should be explained as the view of existence
of the ultimately inexistent, here it is not made verbally
explicit that the notion of ultimate existence of the
(imagined) is the notion of its intrinsically identifiable
existence, said to be "reification".  Nevertheless, since
the meaning of the treatise is that where there is
intrinsically identifiable existence, there also is ultimate
existence, ("reification" here) is tantamount to the
reification of an ultimate existence of the imaginatively
constructed.

 Although in the Elucidation, the relative is called
"processes which are the ground of the imagined reality, and
the basis of ascriptive and descriptive designation," and in
this text, (Asanga) refers obviously to the relative by the
statement (that repudiation is the notion of) "the
non-existence of the ultimately existent basis of designative
verbal signs," it is not wrong to explain it as both (the
latter two realities), since, if the relative were ultimately
inexistent, the perfect would also become ultimately inexistent.

 In the Bodhisattva Stages (Asanga) declares:  "Upon
repudiation of the mere actuality of things such as form, etc.,
there is neither reality nor designation, and both together
have no validity."

  Therefore, repudiation of relative
actuality does not take the form "it does not exist
conventionally," nor the form "generally, it does not
exist," but, as stated previously, takes the form "the
ultimately existent is non-existent."

##### PROCEDURE TO NEGATE BOTH EXTREMISMS
 If such is the pattern of reification and repudiation,
how are they to be abandoned?  As will be explained below
in detail, the extreme of reification is negated by showing
that everything is ultimately empty with respect to
ascriptive and descriptive designations.
  Immediately after
the last quote, (Asanga) negates repudiation thus:
Thus, for example, if the aggregates, such
as form, exist, it is possible to designate "person".  If
held as non-existent, there being no actuality, there is
no designation "person".  
Likewise, if the mere actuality
of things such as form exists, it is possible to ascribe
words designative of things such as form to them.

  If
they are held to be non-existent, with no actuality,
there is no ascription by designative words.
  If the
designative base is held to be non-existent, designation
becomes non-existent, since it becomes unfounded.

 The antagonist whose position is negated
as being "repudiation" is not liable to be found among the
heterodox.

  And, among the orthodox of the Individual
Vehicle, there is no theory that things such as form,
which are the designative base of verbal and conventional
expressions, are non-existent with respect to intrinsic
identity.
  Therefore, as the Compendium explains,
(the antagonist) is a Universal Vehicle philosopher, an
advocate of realitylessness who maintains that things are
not established by intrinsic identity.
  His position is
definitely not that things such as the relative are generally
inexistent, or conventionally inexistent, but is that they are
not established in the ultimate.  Therefore, the negation,
"if the mere actuality does not exist," refutes the position
that an ultimately existent, real actuality (of things) is
inexistent, as explained above.
 According to this (Idealistic) system, it is not necessary
that the imagined be non-existent, if not established by intrinsic
identity, or not existent ultimately.

  However, if the other two
realities are not established by intrinsic identity, or in the
ultimate, they do not exist at all.

  (This system) holds that
the relative, which consists of mind and mental functions
arising dependent on their own causes and conditions, has
ultimate production through intrinsically identifiable
production, and that otherwise, if it were no more than the
mere designation "production," an intellectual supposition,
then there would be no such thing  as production in the
actuality of mind and mental functions.

 Therefore, (this system) is not satisfied with the answer that
"there is no repudiation of relative process, since such
process does exist superficially, according to the mere
adherence to production and cessation by erroneous
cognition".

  It considers that one who adopts the
position that "although relative causality is causality
according to the error of the truth-habit about causality,
the relative itself is not (ultimately) established as
causality, just as a rope is a snake according to the
erroneous cognition supposing a snake in a rope, but is not
generally experienced as having snake-status"--such a one
cannot abandon repudiation, as he has no foundation on which
to establish the effects of actions, i.e., happiness and
suffering from virtue and vice; and that if one admits
any other sort of causality, it has to be causality
established by intrinsic identity, thus equivalent to
ultimately existent (causality).

  Hence, they explain
that (such a position) becomes the chief form of nihilism,
since there is no designation without a designative base,
and since it is impossible for all things to be mere
designations and still to have real functional efficiency.

In the Bodhisattva Stages, (Asanga) declares:
Thus, some people hear the exposition
of the intended meaning of the Scriptures which are hard
to understand with their Universal Vehicle (spirit) and their
profound emptiness, and do not understand correctly the meaning
of the explanations.
  Their view (distorted) by mere mental
constructions springing from the irrationality of incorrect
analysis, they proclaim:  "All this is mere designation.
 This
is reality.
  Who sees it thus, truly sees!"  According to
them, as there is no simple actuality of a designative base,
designation itself becomes entirely inexistent.
  How then
could "mere designation" be a reality?  Therefore, by that
formula, they repudiate both reality and designation.
  And,
since they repudiate both reality and designation, they
should be known as the chief nihilists!

(Aryasanga) further declares, in the same text:

So intending, (Buddha) said, "The view of person
(as real) is harmless, but not the misapprehension of
emptiness!"  

The former is merely ignorance with regard to
an object, and does not repudiate all objects of knowledge,
and hence, on that basis, one is not reborn in hell.
  One still believes other teachings, does not deviate from the
basic precepts, and thus one is not ruined.
  The latter is just the opposite.

 That being so, (Asanga  quotes the scriptural
formula):  "When one thing does not exist in another,
that other is empty of the one, but what remains (of that
other) does exist.
  Such insight is the accurate penetration
of emptiness". 

 He then comments that the meaning of the first phrase
refers to things such as form, etc., being empty of the
entities verbally designated in them, and the "existent
remainder" means the existence of the pure actuality
which is the designative base, and of the simple
designation itself.

  The "emptied" is the imagined, the
"empty" is the relative, and the emptiness of the latter
with respect  to the former is the perfect.
  The
relevance of their existence and non-existence is as
explained above.

 Thus, abandoning the extreme of reification eliminates
absolutism, and abandoning the extreme of repudiation
eliminates nihilism, and hence non-duality is manifested.

Such emptiness is explained to be the final ultimate.
(Still) in the Bodhisattva Stages, (Asanga) states:
The actuality implicit in the nature of
the teaching which liberates from existence and non-existence
of the above things and of nothingness, is non-duality.

And non-duality is the central way, the avoidance of the
two extremes, which is called "unexcelled".

##### EXPLANATION IN THE COMPENDIUM

##### THE ANTAGONIST'S OPINION AND INQUIRY INTO ITS MEANING
 In the Compendium, (Asanga) states:  "Some followers
of the Universal Vehicle say, through their own misapprehension,
that all things exist superficially, and nothing exists
ultimately".

 The Centrists express the differentiation of existence and
non-existence of things thus:  "all things exist conventionally,
though they are non-existent in the ultimate".  

(The
Compendium continues):
At that, we must say, "Sir! What is the
ultimate?  And what is the superficial?"  Thus interrogated,
if they answer, "The ultimate is the realitylessness of
all things.
  The superficial is the apprehension of realities
in things without intrinsic reality.
  Why?  Because those
things which do not exist, are perceived as superficial,
as designations, as mental formulations, and as conventions".

 Thus, the answer given to the question about
the two realities is taken as the antagonist's position.
   In
asking "what is the ultimate?" he asks for exemplification
of ultimate truth, and does not ask for the locus of the
non-existence which is ultimate non-existence, i.e., what sort
of inexistence is called "ultimate inexistence".  
Otherwise,
the answer that "the realitylessness of all things is the
ultimate" would be incorrect, because the Centrist does not
posit any ultimate existence by virtue of any existence of the
objective selflessness accepted as ultimate.
  Likewise,
in asking "what is the superficial?" he asks for that according
to which the superficial is established as reality, as in the
expresssion, "superficial reality," and does not ask what is the
convention that is the locus of the existence which is conventional
existence.

  Otherwise, the answer that "the apprehension of reality
in realityless things is the superficial" would be incorrect,
because the Centrist believes that such (false apprehension)
is the truth-habit, and hence its supposed object does not
exist even conventionally, and also because the "reality"
negated in the expression "realitylessness" must be taken
as reality which is truth.


##### REFUTATION OF THE ANTAGONIST'S OPINION

##### EXHIBITION OF CONTRADICTION IN HIS THEORY
 First of all, to refute the (antagonist's) description
of the superficial, the Compendium statement is:
At that, you must explain yourself; do
you believe that the apprehension of reality occurs from
a verbal and superficial cause? Or do you believe that it
is merely verbal formulation and superficiality?  If it
occurs from a verbal and superficial cause, then it cannot
be said to be non-existent.
  If it is merely verbal
formulation and superficiality, then it is impossible to
call it "formulation" and "superficial," as (these terms)
will have no basis.

 This means that the superficial, which is
the notion of a reality where there is no reality in the
ultimate, is an internal verbalization, which is either produced
by a homogeneous previous cause, or else is a sheer designation
by superficial verbalizing mental construction.
  In the first
case, "it cannot be said to be inexistent, if causally
produced" means "it cannot be said to be ultimately
inexistent," because the context is the argument about
ultimate existence and inexistence, and because the antagonist
asserts ultimate non-existence, and not general non-existence.
In the second case, it is impossible for it to be sheer
imagined designation, because there is no designative base,
and because if verbalization and superficiality were merely
mentally constructed designations, then other things
(i.e., the ultimate) also would be just the same.
 As for the negation of the (antagonist's) description of
the ultimate, the Compendium statement is:
At that, you must explain yourself:  Sir!
Why is it that what is apprehended is non-existent?  Thus
questioned, if you answer: "Because it is a false thing,"
then you must say if that falseness exists or not.
  If
it exists, then it is incorrect to say that the
realitylessness of all things is itself the ultimate.
And if it does not exist, then it is incorrect to say
that what is apprehended is without reality because it is
a false thing.


 This means that it is not correct to say
that the intrinsically identifiable intrinsic identity
apprehended in things does not exist, because that (statement)
is faulted by the evidence of such apprehension.

  And if one
objects that it is not faulted by the cognition that apprehends
such, because that cognition is itself a false thing, it is not
correct; because, if that falsity existed with intrinsic identity,
realitylessness could not possibly be ultimate, and if it did
not (so) exist, as it would also be an error, its apprehension
would not exist.

  Although here also the analysis should be
in terms of ultimate existence and non-existence, the above
analysis (in terms of intrinsic identity) is employed as
similar in meaning and as easier to understand.

 Thus, here, without demonstrating the flaw in (the assertion
of) ultimate non-existence and conventional existence of both
imagined and perfect, he indicates discrepancies through
analysis of ultimate existence and non-existence of superficial
consciousness and false consciousness, thereby negating (the
assertion of) ultimate non-existence and superficial existence
of the relative.  

The relative is the subject (qualified by)
the perfect, and the means of designation and the designative
base of the imagined; therefore, these experts chiefly debate
the ultimate existence and non-existence of the relative.

 Furthermore, in the Compendium, (Asanga) declares:
The insistence on the imagined reality in the
relative and the perfect should be recognized as the extreme
of reification.

  The extreme of repudiation is the repudiation
of intrinsic identity in asserting that the existent relative
and perfect realities do not exist.

  The pattern of the import
of reality should be realized by means of the procedure avoiding
these two extremes.

 Thus, the assertion that there is no
intrinsically identifiable status in the latter two realities,
which do exist by intrinsic identity, repudiates intrinsic
identity.

  Hence, this text agrees with the Bodhisattva
Stages about the two extremes and the procedure to avoid them.

 The imagined is non-existent in the ultimate, and not
non-existent in the conventional.

  The Compendium
statement is:
Those suppositions established by names
and internal formulations, are they or are they not the
(imagined) reality?  Conventionally, they should be stated
to be that reality.

  Ultimately, they should be stated
not to be that reality.

  The imagined reality, which is
the object of consciousness based on names habitual in
internal verbalization is designatively existent, and
is non-existent ultimately.

 Therefore, simply by the fact that such as
the imagined (reality) of the two selves is inexistent among
knowable objects, all of the imaginatively constructed
is not inexistent.

  Hence, its substantial existence and
ultimate existence are negated, but its designative existence
and conventional existence are affirmed.

 Therefore, (we should explain the following) explanation from a
certain great commentary of the Elucidation:

The imagined is non-existent in both
realities; 

the dependent origination, which is the relative
with its subject-object duality, is superficially existent,
and the perfect, which is also ultimate, exists in the mode
of realitylessness, existing ultimately.

This is not the intended meaning of that
Scripture.  Furthermore, it shows a serious lack of discrimination
to claim that this work was composed by Aryasanga, since it
contradicts the explanation of the Universal Vehicle Compendium
that internal and external subject and object are the imagined;
it contradicts the Bodhisattva Stages and the Compendium
by proving the non-existence of externals citing the Elucidation;
it quotes the Determination of Validating Cognition, and so
forth.

  Finally, the Compendium quotes most of the chapters
of the Elucidation, except for the preface, and settles the
difficult questions thoroughly, so it does not appear that this
Master need have composed an extra commentary.

 Also, some recent authors have departed from this system by
explaining the intention of Aryasanga and Vasubandhu as being
the non-existence of the imagined, even conventionally, the
conventional existence and the ultimate inexistence of the
relative, and the ultimate existence of the perfect.

Especially their belief that, since the meaning of conventional
existence of the relative is that the erroneous intellect merely
supposes the existence of production and cessation therein,
production and cessation do not exist in things, is the
ultimate repudiation of things.

  Since thereby the other two
realities are repudiated as well, this is the chief nihilism
repudiating all three natures, as explained above in the
Bodhisattva Stages, and should also be recognized as
irreconcilably contradictory to the position that the
Elucidation is definitive in meaning.

##### ELIMINATION OF CONTRADICTION IN (ASANGA'S) THEORY
 Here, one may object that, "if it is true, as the
Bodhisattva Stages and the Compendium declare, that
the relative is ultimately existent, how can it fail to contradict
the (following statements)?  

The Elucidation statement is:

If the reality, the ultimate, and the objective
selflessness of things were each to be different in character,
as, for example, the branches of the Holy Path are different
in character from each other, then reality, the ultimate, and
objective selflessness would each have a cause.  Were they to
arise from causes, they would be created.
  Were they to be created, they could not be ultimate.

 "Thus, what is created is not ultimate.
The Center and Extremes states that 'the ultimate is
unique,' and its commentary states that 'the ultimate reality
should be known as the sole perfect reality'.

  Further,
the Scripture Ornament states:  'The nature of the ultimate
is that which purifies.
  It is not existent, not non-existent,
not the same, and not other, not produced and not ceased, not
decreased and not increased, nor even is it to be purified'.

Here, in the passage on the five characteristics of the ultimate,
it is declared to be without production and cessation, etc., the
commentary stating that 'it is not existent' with regard to the
imagined and the relative, and 'not non-existent' with regard
to the perfect.

Finally, the Compendium also states:  'Should causes be said
to exist superficially, or to exist ultimately?  They should be
said to exist superficially.

Should imagination be said to
exist superficially, or to exist ultimately?  It should be said
to exist superficially.'"
  
 To explain how these statements do not contradict (the ultimate
existence of the relative), there are two modes of establishment
(of something) as superficially existent or as ultimately
existent.

  First, conventional existence is presented as
existence established on the strength of conventional expressions,
and ultimate existence is presented as existence by intrinsic
identity not established on the strength of conventional
expressions.

  This (first mode) is exemplified by many
statements in Scriptures, such as "that is on the strength of
mundane conventions, and not in the ultimate".

  This (mode of
establishment) is the basis of the arguments about ultimate
and conventional existence and non-existence between the
Centrists and the Realists, both heterodox and orthodox.

And the Bodhisattva Stages and the Compendium make
the above statements of the conventional existence and ultimate
non-existence of the first reality, and of the ultimate
existence and the conventional non-existence of the latter
two realities, in terms of this (mode of establishment).

Furthermore, the Compendium states:
The object of that consciousness that is
based on names habitual in internal formulation does not exist
either substantially or ultimately insofar as its existence
is by intrinsic identity of things such as form, etc., which
have names such as "form," etc.

  Therefore, that which is
imaginatively constructed from what is not existent as the
reality of those things having names such as "form," etc.,
should be known as designatively existent.

(However), the things that have names such as "form,"
being objects of that consciousness of nominal things which
excludes habitual internal formulations, which (objects)
exist by their inexpressible nature, should be understood
as existent both substantially and ultimately.

 In regard to substantial existence and
designative existence, the Compendium statement is:
It is proper that designated intrinsic
identity, which does not require or depend on other things,
should be known as substantially existent.

  And it is proper
that designated intrinsic identity which requires and depends
on other things should be known as designatively existent,
and not substantially existent.

 Here, the latter is exemplified by the
designation of "self" or "living being" depending upon the
aggregates.

  In this system, there is no contradiction between
the designative existence which cannot be apprehended out of
relationship with other things and must be subject to dependence,
and intrinsically identifiable status not established on
strength of convention.

  Hence, although such as the instincts
of the fundamental consciousness are declared to be
designatively existent, this does not preclude their ultimate
existence, (according to the first mode above).

  However,
such ultimate existence would be precluded by the designative
existence resulting (merely) from verbal and conceptual
designation.

 In regard to the second mode of establishment (of superficial
and ultimate existences), the Center and Extremes states:
"The ultimate is considered threefold:  as object, attainment,
and practice."

 In comment, (Vasubandhu) declares that the "object-ultimate
is reality, because it is the object of the holy wisdom," where
"holy" specifies the wisdom which is immaculate equipoise.
As it is an object, it is called "ultimate-object," or "ultimate".

It is reality, equivalent to selflessness, and is also the ultimate
which is the pure object.
  It is stated thus, since it is only the
perfect, the other two realities being non-existent therein.

The Center and Extremes further states:  "the pure object
is twofold, proclaimed to be one alone," and the commentary adds,
"it is declared to be the perfect reality, the other two realities
not being objects of both kinds of pure wisdom," the two wisdoms
being the wisdoms that purify the two obscurations.

 Here, we might suspect that such wisdom would itself also become
an object, since this system asserts that that wisdom is
apperceptively self-conscious.
  There is no such fault (in the
system), however, since, regarding whatever object, (the system)
intends it to be an object for the realization of the meaning of
ultimate reality.

 Therefore, such an ultimate is uncreated.

  However, in this system,
non-establishment in this sort of ultimate does not preclude
establishment in an ultimate which is existent by intrinsic
identity, not established on the strength of convention.

  The
Synthesis of the Essence of Intuition states, intending the
first mode of ultimate existence:  "Liberated from subject and
object, consciousness exists in the ultimate.  It is celebrated
in the Scriptures of the Experientialist Yogi, who crosses the
ocean of the mind."

 It is necessary to differentiate accurately these two sorts
of ultimates, since many of the Centrist treatises argue against
the Experientialists about the existence and non-existence of
the relative, not in terms of convention, but in terms of
ultimate existence and non-existence.  And there are many
occasions in the treatises of the Brother-Masters on which they
depend on the second mode of establishment of the ultimate.

 About the mode of the superficial existence of the first two
realities, the Compendium statement is:  

"Causal process
and imaginative construction exist superficially by reason
that they motivate the addictions and are the basis of
designations".

 It is first stated herein, in agreement with the Abhidharma
Synthesis, that that which motivates addictions when apprehended
is established as superficially existent, which (statement)
complements the Elucidation explanation of the ultimate
as the pure object.
  Second, it states that the reality designated
by verbal and symbolic conventions, which becomes the basis of
conventionally designative signs, is said to be existent
conventionally.

  "Causal process" is explained to be that on
which the words of formulations are based.

 Again, in the Principles of Elucidation (Vasubandhu) states:
The superficial reality and the ultimate reality
were declared intending the objects that deceive common
consciousness and the object of transcendent consciousness.

Since verbalization is superficial, the reality known thereby
is the superficial reality, i.e., that to which verbalizations
apply.

  For example, a ford crossed by foot is called a
"foot-ford," and a ford crossed by boat is called a "boat-ford".

 The Compendium states that the holy wisdom,
which is the equipoise of realization of ultimate reality, exists
in the ultimate, intending the absence of the above two reasons
for establishing its superficial existence.  And it states that
the aftermath wisdom exists both superficially and ultimately,
asserting its conventional existence from the point of view of
its apprehension of conventional signs.


Superficial existence, as the cause of perceptions motivating
addictions and as the signification-process which is designative
base for conventional expressions, does not preclude ultimate
existence which is establishment by intrinsic identity.
  As the
Principles of Elucidation states, (some things) exist in
both the first mode of the ultimate, and in the latter mode of
the superficial:
Concerning the argument of the Individual
Vehicle sectarians regarding the statement of the Scripture
on Ultimate Emptiness that action and retribution exist,
but the agent is not apprehended, "if (such existence and
non-existence) are in the ultimate, it cannot be said that
all things are realityless, and if they are in the superficial,
then the agent would exist (ultimately), and it could not be
said that it is not apprehended;" we answer that if it is known
what are the superficial and the ultimate, existence in them
both is known.

  What are they?  The superficial consists of
names, verbalizations, designations, and conventions, and
the ultimate is the intrinsic identity of things.

  Thus,
action and retribution exist both as names and as intrinsic
identities, and hence they must be admitted as existent
whatever one's belief.


 In regard to the belief in their existence
in the ultimate, it is not precluded in this system, as it
does not accept literally the declaration of the realitylessness
of all things.

  The person, (or agent), exists superficially,
but not substantially.

  Action and retribution exist superficially,
and also substantially, but they do not exist in the second mode
of ultimate establishment, as they are objects of common
consciousness and not the objects of transcendent consciousness,
because its object is the inexpressible general nature (of all
things).

  Finally, the explanation of the Principles of
Elucidation is very clear (on the point) that the above
(Individualist) argument applies to the position of some other
Universalists, that all things exist superficially, and not
by intrinsic identity.


 The Center and Extremes divides the superficial reality,
the vague reality, into three:  "The vague (reality) consists
of designations, cognitions, and intimations".

  Thus,
(of the) three, the designative superficial, the cognitive
superficial, and the intimative superficial, it is necessary
to know the latter, which is connected with the third reality
(i.e., the perfect),
to explain the intention of the statements from other Scriptures
that suchness, etc., are superficially existent.


 Thus, if we differentiate precisely the modes of existence,
substantial and designative, superficial and ultimate, of the
lower and higher theories, as well as the various interpretations
of them within one philosophical school, we are able to master
fully the important theories and we may come to understand the
many designatively and superficially existent (things), asserted
(dogmatically) by the Realists, that the Centrist must prove to
them are non-existent in the ultimate.  Otherwise, the
differentiation of the lower and higher philosophies is just for fun.


##### 1.  GENERAL PROCEDURE TO ELIMINATE TWO EXTREMES (cont.)
##### EXPLANATIONS IN OTHER TREATISES
##### EXPLANATION IN THE ORNAMENT OF UNIVERSAL VEHICLE SCRIPTURES

 The Scripture Ornament explains that the declaration
of realitylessness intends the non-existence of the reality supposed
by the naive and of the three characteristics of created things:
"Realitylessness is admitted, because (things) do not exist as
selves, or with intrinsic identities, do not endure in intrinsic
objectivity, and do not exist as they are perceived".

 The Synthesis also explains that the Hundred Thousand
declares realitylessness intending the realitylessness of these
two as well as of the three unrealities.

  Things are realityless
since they are not independent, but depend on conditions.

  This
means that they are not born from their own selves, as the
Central Way Illumination explains.

  Things are realityless
since they do not exist by their intrinsic natures, and, once
ceased, are not born again with the same natures.

  And they are
realityless since they do not endure another second in any intrinsic
objectivity, as their production and non-cessation is (merely)
instantaneous.

  In short, things are explained as realityless in
the three times, the future sprout not born by its own power,
the past sprout not born again with the nature of the sprout,
and the present sprout not remaining a second instant established
as itself.

 Vasubandhu explains that there is no reality because the
realities otherwise insisted upon by the naive, such as the imagined
reality, or purity, happiness, permanence, and self, do not exist.

"Otherwise" means they persist in their convictions through
(the misapprehension of) substantial difference of subject and
object.

 As there is no reality, there is no production, as no production,
no cessation, etc., each subsequent condition is established by
reason of each preceding condition.

  The Scripture Ornament
states:  "Realitylessness is established since each (thing) is the
basis of each subsequent one, and hence (are established)
non-production, non-cessation, primordial peace, and natural
liberation".
  Further:  "Tolerance of non-production of
things is recommended, in the light of their beginning, sameness,
otherness, intrinsic identity, self, transformation, addiction,
and excellence."

 This explains the mode of non-production of things referred to
in such statements as "tolerance of non-production of things is
attained".  

"Beginning," as the commentary explains, refers to
the non-existence of an original production in samsaric life;
"sameness" to the fact that a past thing previously produced is
not reproduced in its own nature; "otherness" to the non-existence
of production at a future time of what did not exist previously.

This means, as the Central Illumination explains, that nothing
is produced without precedent, and no living being is produced
for the first time in the life-cycle, because they are produced
alike in type to what came to an end (previously).

  "Intrinsic
identity" refers to the imagined, which is never produced.

"Self-" production (does not exist) in the relative.  Production
which is "transformation" does not exist in the perfect.

non-production of "addiction" lies in attainment of the knowledge
of (its) extermination.

  And the "excellence" of non-production
lies in the Absolute Body of the Buddha.

 Such explanation of the system of realitylessness and the mode
of non-production constitutes the system that does not accept
literally the exposition of all things as ultimately devoid of
reality and that of created things as ultimately unproduced.

It shares with the two Individual Vehicle schools the mode of
realitylessness (of happiness, purity, permanence, and self),
which is insisted upon (as reality) by the naive.  The present
is excepted by the Analysts, who assert it to be the basis of the
durative function after production, and of the destructive
function after that.

 (At this point), one may protest that, since the Elucidation
declares the relative to be illusory, and the Scripture Ornament
declares all created things to be illusory, they do not mean that
(the relative) is truly established, (as has been maintained above).

Nevertheless, the description (of something) as being "like illusion"
does not invariably show it not to be truth.
  This rather depends on
the method of use of similes such as "illusion".  

The Scripture
Ornament shows the method of use of the simile, illusion, in
the statement:  "Artificial imagination is said to be illusory,
and the error of duality is said to be like an illusory
creation".

 Vasubandhu explains that the meaning of the first phrase is that
the application of the magical spell to the bases of the illusion
such as mound and tree, etc., is like the imaginative construction
of the relative.  And the meaning of the second phrase is that the
appearance of the magical effects in the forms of horses and
elephants, etc., is like the appearance of the relative as
dichotomous subject and object.

  Furthermore, the Scripture
Ornament declares:  "The ultimate is admitted, insofar as that
(duality) does not exist therein.
  And where that (duality) is
apprehended, there is the superficial reality."

 The commentary explains that the ultimate is the non-existence
of subject-object-duality in the relative, just as the elephants,
etc., do not exist in the illusions, and that such imagination of
the artificial is apprehended as the superficial reality, just as
the illusion is apprehended as actual horses and elephants.

  Thus,
the Scripture Ornament does not declare "illusion" as a simile
of the appearance of reality in internal and external created
things, of which (reality) they are devoid (in fact), but
explains the Scriptures' declarations of "illusoriness" as
illustrating the appearance of the six inner media as self and
life, etc., when they do not (actually) exist as such, and of
"dream-likeness" as illustrating the appearance of the six
external media as the field of involvement of personal self,
when (in fact) they do not exist as such.

 The Universal Vehicle Compendium, in supplying the meanings
for the similes of the relative, such as "illusion," employed in
the Mother Scripture, explains "illusion" as the simile
employed to dispel the doubt:  "If there are no external things,
how do we apprehend objects?"  It explains "mirage" as the simile
employed to dispel the doubt:  "If there are no external things,
how are mind and mental functions produced?"  And it explains
"dream," etc., as the similes employed to dispel the doubt:
"If there are no external things, why do we act on the basis of
attraction and repulsion?"

 Thus, even in regard to (such an obvious thing) as the method
of employment of similes such as "illusion" for untrueness,
we must distinguish without confusion the methods of employment
of similes for the different types of untrueness in the
Idealist and the Centrist theories.


##### EXPLANATION IN THE DISCRIMINATION OF CENTER AND EXTREMES
 
 In the Center and Extremes, (Maitreya) states:

Artificial imagination exists, (but) therein
duality does not.

  Herein emptiness exists, and that
(imagination) exists therein.

It is not empty, and not non-empty; thus, everything is
explained.

  Through existence, non-existence, and existence,
such is the Central Way.


 The first verse teaches the nature of emptiness;
and the second teaches the same thing as the Central Way.

  It
teaches emptiness accurately, in order to show what is declared
to be the unmistaken realization of emptiness, the authentic
knowledge of existence and non-existence, which is expressed
as "when one thing does not exist in another, that other is
devoid of the one, but what remains (of the other) does exist.
"

  "In another" means the empty, which is (the process of)
"artificial imagination," i.e., the relative.  The "one thing"
that does "not exist" means the duality of substantially
different subject and object, i.e., the imagined.
  "Therein"
duality "does not" exist teaches the emptiness of that relative
with respect to this imagined.
  That being non-existent, what is
that remaining existence?  "Artificial imagination" and "herein
emptiness exists" show both relative and perfect (as what remains).

"And that exists therein" dispels yet another doubt.

 Sthiramati clearly shows agreement with Vasubandhu's explanation
of the meaning of "the empty" and of "that of which it is
empty.
"  

The Subcommentary states:

Some people think that all things are totally
realityless, 

like the horns of a rabbit, 

and thus repudiate everything.

---

  "Artificial imagination exists" is declared
to refute them, and "by intrinsic reality" should be added
(to complete the sense).
 

 The expression "artificial imagination exists"
is not complete in itself, the remainder to be added being
this "by intrinsic reality". 

 Thus, it is not that artificial
imagination merely exists, it exists by its intrinsic reality,
or exists established by intrinsic identity, such modes of
existence being the same in the case of the perfect also.

 In regard to the way in which the second phrase dispels doubt,
the same (Subcommentary) declares:

Is this not contrary to the Scriptures, which
declare that all things are empty?  

It is not contradictory.

"Therein duality does not exist" means that artificial imagination
is empty, because free of the nature of subject and object,
and not that it is totally realityless.
  
  Hence, it does not contradict the Scriptures.


 To rebut the argument that the intrinsically
real status of the relative contradicts the statement that all
things are empty of intrinsically real existence, he states that
emptiness of intrinsic reality is stated intending that imagination,
which appears as dichotomous internal subject and external object,
is empty with respect to such (dichotomous) reality, and not
that intrinsically identifiable reality is totally non-existent.

This alone is the meaning of the treatises of the Brothers, and,
as they also explain (the relative) as ultimately existent, there
is definitely no explanation in their system of the relative as
empty in itself.

 In regard to the way in which the third phrase dispels doubt,
the Subcommentary states:

If one protests that, since duality is totally
non-existent like a rabbit's horns and artificial imagination
utlimately exists by its intrinsic reality, then emptiness
becomes non-existent; 

(we say) not so.
  "Emptiness exists
therein" means that emptiness does not become non-existent,
because the very non-existence of subject and object in
artificial imagination is itself emptiness.


 It is obvious how doubt about the non-existence
of emptiness might arise, since "artificial imagination exists and
duality does not exist" indicates existence of the former and
non-existence of the latter, (and thus the perfect is not
mentioned).

  The argument "artificial imagination ultimately exists by intrinsic reality" assumes (its opponent's)
position to be that establishment by intrinsic identity is
equivalent to ultimate existence, and the argument rebuts from
just such a position, not saying "such is not our position".

 This master also declared, in the Thirty Commentary:
The chapter was composed in order to refute
these two kinds of extremism:  the notion (of some) that objects,
like consciousness, (exist) substantially, and the notion of
others that consciousness, like objects, exists superficially
and does not exist ultimately.

 Therefore, the statement that the relative
is not totally non-existent refutes the position that nothing
at all exists ultimately, like the passages from the
Bodhisattva Stages earlier, and does not refute a position
that (the relative) does not exist among knowable objects.

 The fourth phrase dispels doubt of wondering why it is not
(universally) realized, if emptiness of duality were always
existent in artificial imagination, by showing the fact that,
as the imagination mistaking dualistic appearance exists in
that emptiness, it obscures (that realization).

 The second verse is declared in order to refute those
extremisms which are not the central way, which maintain
one-sidedly that all things are empty, that they are non-empty,
that they exist, or that they do not exist.

  All things are
not empty with respect to imagination and emptiness, and they are
not non-empty with respect to subject-object-duality, (all things
being either) created imaginative construction or uncreated
emptiness.

  According to Vasubandhu, this explanation should be
taken in agreement with the teaching of the Mother Scripture,
etc., that "all this is neither uniquely empty, nor uniquely
non-empty," and it does not indicate the perfect by "not empty,"
nor the other two realities by "not non-empty.
"  (The third
phrase) should be understood according to the explanation of
Vasubandhu and Sthiramati, "existence" meaning imagination,
"non-existence" meaning duality, and "existence" meaning the
mutual existence of both imagination and emptiness.
  Any
explanation that opposes these (Masters), such as that, as
one of those two (imagination and emptiness) exists otherwise,
the other is empty, should not be taken as explaining (correctly)
the belief of these (Masters).
  And Sthiramati explains that this
import is the same as that declared in the Kashyapa Chapter,
after explaining existence and non-existence as two extremes,
that between them lies the central way of critical examination of
things.
  Therefore, although according to some deviant Centrists,
who explain this very system of the "pure information" (school)
as similar to the Centrists, the latter of those two (relative
and perfect) is believed superior to the former, (in fact) this
system makes those two equivalent.

 We have thus expressed the method of explanation in each section,
according to Vasubandhu and Sthiramati.  Dignaga also, in his
Concise Meaning of the Transcendent Wisdom, explains the import
of the Eight Thousand in agreement with the Universal Vehicle
Compendium.

  And Dharmakirti, in the Treatise on Validating
Cognition, declares the reality of the relative to be the
emptiness of substantially different subject and object:  "Therein,
if either were non-existent, both would be destroyed.
  Therefore,
emptiness of duality is the reality of that (relative).
"

 Further, he explains the meaning of the Scriptures' declarations
of the realitylessness of things in the same way:
The inherence of difference in things is based
on the difference of that (subject and object).
 That being itself
an error, difference in things is also an error.
 No nature exists
other than the aspects of subject and object.
  Therefore, because
of emptiness of (that) nature, realitylessness is proclaimed.

 The differentiation of things as in their
production, etc., is not effected by means of mere apperception,
but by means of the consciousness that perceives duality.
  Dualistic
perception is a delusion.
  Since it is false, what it establishes
also becomes false.  There is no nature of anything other than
subjects and objects, and the nature of such apparent duality
is proclaimed to be realitylessness, since it does not exist as
it appears.
  Furthermore, he declares in his Treatise:  "All
natures of such things as aggregates are specifically qualified
as functional, and not real.
  Hence, they are (ultimately) free
of natures.
"

 Statements of the form aggregates, etc., as natural things, and of
formability, etc., as their natures, all are qualified by
functionality.
  Although their basis exists substantially, they are
not established in reality through their aspect of functionality.

Hence, he explains that this is intended by the declaration of
emptiness with respect to nature, which (theory) he holds in common
with the Individual Vehicle schools.
  Finally, the Treatise on
Validating Cognition makes the same point earlier stated in the
Compendium:
If (one objects):  "everything is without
(functional) power (ultimately)," (we answer) "the power of
the seed, etc., is visible in the sprout, etc."  (And if one)
maintains "that is superficial (only)," (we answer) "then how
could (the sprout) ever come to be?"

 As for the details of the methods of
explanation of these teachers, I do not discuss them, fearing
prolixity.

##### SPECIFIC NEGATION OF THE EXTREME OF REIFICATION
##### DESCRIPTION OF REIFICATION--THE NEGATEE

 Repudiation, one of the two logical negatees of this
system, is only philosophically postulated, and furthermore,
as explained above is (mainly) in the system of the orthodox
advocates of realitylessness.
  In reification, there are both
conscious theoretical and unconscious instinctual varieties, the
conscious reification being the (philosophical) systems of the
Realists, both heterodox and orthodox.
  In regard to unconscious
reification, as the reification of the personal self will be
shown below, here we should explain the reification of the
objective self, because although the objective self is a
theoretical postulate, it is the object (that would have)
to be proven (to secure) the objective self maintained
unconsciously, and also because that (objective self)
is the chief logical negatee.

 Although in many texts of this system, the objective self-habit
is explained to be none other than the habitual notion of the
substantial difference between subject and object, the
Elucidation teaches the objective self-habit to be the
habitual notion that ascriptive and descriptive designations
are established by intrinsic identifiability in the relative.
This is implied by its explanation of objective selflessness
as identity-unreality, which is the non-establishment by
intrinsic identifiability of the relative according to
ascriptive and descriptive designation.

  Furthermore, the
Bodhisattva Stages, the Compendium of Determinations,
and the Compendium of the Universal Vehicle take pains to
prove that emptiness devoid of the content of this habitual
notion is the ultimate meaning of the central way, and is the
perfect, which is objective selflessness.

  Therefore, if we do
not know just what is this imaginatively constructed (reality)
which is reified as the objective self in the relative, we will
not know decisively the objective self-habit and the objective
selflessness of this system.

 The imagined (reality), in question when the objective
self-habit is taken as the habitual notion that the imagined
is established by intrinsic identifiability, is that reality
verbally and conventionally designated in such things as
the aggregates, ascriptively through statements such as
"This is form!" and descriptively through such statements  as
"This is production of form!"  

Since the aggregates, etc., do
exist just that much, the notion that they exist there is
not reification.

  Reification is the habitual notion that the
aggregates exist by intrinsic identity as such and such
(designated) entities.

 Here, an objector might well demand reasons to prove the absence
of a number of contradictions in this system (which he might
perceive to be as follows):  (first), if the negation of the
intrinsically identifiable status of form, etc., as being the
objective basis of names and signs, negates (only) their
being the direct objective basis of expressions, then it is
unnecessary to prove the relative to be devoid of that (imagined
reality) since the Realists have already established the
non-phenomenality of objective universals and verbal universals
as actual contents and means of expressions.

  Furthermore,
(by the same reason), since the proof of (the relative's)
emptiness with respect to that (sort of imagined reality)
does not establish objective selflessness, (there being no
objective selflessness in the Individualist schools), meditation
on such (inferior) emptiness will not purify the objective
obscurations, which contradicts the Elucidation explanation
that the emptiness of the relative with respect to the
establishment by intrinsic identifiability of the imagined
(reality) is the perfect, objective selflessness, and the
Bodhisattva Stages explanation that such emptiness is the
object causing the purification of the objective obscurations.

In the negation of form, etc., as being the conceptual objects
of expressions, when the existence by intrinsic identity of the
ground differentials of conceptual objects is negated, the
relative will be negated as established by intrinsic
identifiability, and even if (only) the intrinsic identifiability
of the categorical differentials of conceptual objects is negated,
it is (still) invalid (as an interpretation of this system)
since the Traditionalists have proved the non-phenomenality
of universals as the objects of inferential validating
cognitions.

 Furthermore, since the statement from the Life Migration
Scripture:  "Such and such a name expresses such and such a thing,
but does not exist therein, and this is the ultimate nature of
things," is established for the Individualist schools also,
the ultimate, as emptiness (of the relative) with regard to the
imagined, of the Elucidation of Intention, appears to amount
to nothing more than this.

  Finally, it could not be correct
to explain this pattern of emptiness as objective selflessness,
the object used for purifying objective obscurations, since it does
not indicate the pure consciousness that negates substantial
difference between subject and object.

 Let us now explain.

 This pattern of emptiness is not already established by the
Individual Vehicle schools, because the Bodhisattva Stages
explains it to be the object of the wisdom purificative of
objective obscurations and to be the unexcelled central way
avoiding the two extremes, and because the Universal Vehicle
Compendium declares that realization of this (pattern of
emptiness) is realization of pure consciousness.

  Therefore,
the Individualist schools do have philosophical assertions
which amount to that reification which is the opposite of this
(pattern of emptiness); that is, their habitual notion that form,
etc., are established by intrinsic identity as ascriptively
and descriptively verbally designated.

  In negating this
reification, the Bodhisattva Stages refutes with scriptural
reference, so the target of the refutation is also (a member of
an) orthodox (school), and since the refutation would not apply
to the advocates of realitylessness, nor to a particular type
of Experientialist, (it must apply to) the Individual Vehicle
schools.

  And therefore, (it) refutes them with three references
established for them, without quoting the Elucidation.

 (Having thus answered the objections in general, turning to the
description of reification itself), to describe first of all
unconscious reification, the Compendium statement is:  "It
should be recognized that naive people habitually insist on an
intrinsic reality, which accords with names and expressions, in
things subject to expression, because of five reasons.
"

 The first reason is then explained as the fact that (such naive
people), when asked "what is the reality of that thing called
'form'?" they answer "its reality is form!" and not "its name
is 'form'!"  That means that when thus questioned, they give the
name of a thing as its reality, and are unable to say "the reality
of that thing called 'form' is merely its designation by the name
'form'.
"  Therefore, when something is designated by the
expression "form," if we examine the appearance of that thing
which is the basis of designation by the expression "blue,"
it appears to be established on the strength of its own objective
condition; not merely verbally and conventionally posited.

 The holding of that "blue" to be established as it appears is the
reification which holds an intrinsically identifiable status (to
underlie) the designation of something blue by the name "form.
"
The above explanation has established that naive people have this
(habit), and since the two realistic (Individualist) schools
believe such a habit-pattern to have validity, where is their
similarity to the (Idealist) system, in which, although the
categorical differential of the verbally expressible is defined
as mere conceptual designation, its ground differential serves
as its intrinsic identity?

  Thus we can understand particularly
the process of reification in regard to the imagined, as well as
the process of reification in regard to other things.

  And similarly,
when subject and object occur dualistically, the holding of them
both to exist as they appear, substantially different, is the
reification which is the objective self-habit.

  The answers to the
remaining objections will be explained below.

##### THE PROCEDURE TO NEGATE IT
##### ACTUAL NEGATION

The Elucidation of Intention does not give any reasons
proving the relative to be devoid of the imagined.

  Hence, as this
must be understood, the Bodhisattva Stages and the Compendium
give three reasons each.

  The Universal Vehicle Compendium
also states:

To answer the question, "What makes it clear that
the reality of the relative is not as it appears in the imagined
reality?"  

(We say) it is established because of the incompatibility
between their natures, that of multiplicity of nature, and that of
confused natures; because there is no cognition prior to names,
because of multiplicity, and because of vagueness.


 To express simply the proof of the relative being
empty of the imagined because of incompatibility between the natures
of the two; if the fact of a round-bellied thing being the locus or
basis of the expression "pot" were to be established by the intrinsic
identifiability or reality of round-bellied-ness, it would not be
established on strength of conventions, and hence, the conventionally
subjective cognition, without requiring any convention, would arise
thinking "pot" in regard to the round-bellied thing, before there
was any designation of the name "pot.
"

 (To express simply) the proof through the incompatibility between
something being one and its having many natures; since, according
to the antagonist's position, the giving of many names to one thing,
as in calling Indra, "Shakra," "Shatakratu," "Gramaghataka," etc.,
must be on the strength of the thing itself, (the names being) existent
in the thing as they appear to imaginative construction, that one thing
would become many.

 (Third, to express simply) the proof through the incompatibility of
confusing the entities of distinct things; since, according to the
antagonist, when two people are called by the same name, for example,
"Upagupta," there is no difference in the way the cognition
"Upagupta" arises (in regard to each of them), and since name and
imagination apply to each of them on the strength of their objective
reality, the two must become one entity.

 
Since the habitual notion that form, etc., are established ultimately,
or by intrinsic identity, as the bases of conceptual adherence, is
the same as the habitual notion that (form, etc.) are established by
intrinsic identity as the grounds of verbal designations, the
illiterate person, who does not know the names of things, still has
(the unconscious habit of) reification which is the negatee; and the
reasons to negate it are similar also.


The Bodhisattva Stages negates (reification by reasoning that),
while a thing exists before the name is attached to it, that thing
(according to the Realists) should be a non-entity before it is
designated by its name, and otherwise, if it were to exist before the
designation, the cognition "form" would arise, even prior to the name.

Although the Individualists (attempt to evade this refutation) by
saying that, although there would be such faults as nominal cognition
arising prior to conventional information if the direct object of
conventional designation were objectively intrinsically identifiable,
no such faults accrue if form, etc., are established by intrinsic
identity as the ground of conventional designation and as the basis
of conceptual adherence, still (the refutation is) similar (in
application to them).


Thus, although form, etc., being the bases of conceptual adherence
cannot be negated (conventionally) in spite of their being the
verbally and conventionally established imagined (reality), because
they are (conventionally) established by validating cognition, the
same (conceptual basis status) being established through the
intrinsic identity of those things (can be negated), since an
imagined reality set up by words alone cannot possibly be a
knowable object.

  Hence, among things established verbally and
conventionally, there are those established by validating cognition
and those not so established.



Nevertheless, this system asserts that as soon as something is merely
established nominally and conventionally, it cannot participate
in causality.

  The two Realist schools do not know how to
establish the existence of those things such as form, etc., once
their establishment by intrinsic identity as the bases of conceptual
adherence and as the grounds of symbolic designation is negated.

Intrinsic identity (svalakshana) here is not that ultimate
particular (svalakshana) common to the logicians.


It is not contradictory for consciousness, as the basis of
conceptual adherence, to be the imagined reality which is not
established ultimately, and for (the same) consciousness to be
ultimately established (in its relative nature), just as, for
example, a pot's absence, being an absolute negation, is not
prevented from sharing a common ground with the location (from
which it is absent) by (the supposed) contradictoriness of an
absolute negation and a phenomenon.


Therefore, although the statement, "Such and such a name..."
etc., is from a Scripture canonical in the Individualist schools,
it is not that there is no difference between the way they explain
it (and the way this system does).  For example, the expression
"root-consciousness" that is used in the Mahasamghika
school is explained by this system as the fundamental consciousness.

 Since the above-explained habitual notion of existence by intrinsic
identity, or in the ultimate, of ascriptive and descriptive designation
is the chief type of objective obscuration, the determination of the
non-existence of its object is correctly equivalent to the object
purificative of objective obscurations.


Finally, how are these reasonings applied to arrive at "pure
information?"  When we negate the ultimate establishment of things,
from form to omniscience, as being the grounds of designation by verbal
expressions and the bases of conceptual adherence, we reach the
pure information free of subject-object-duality, with the realization
that there is nothing unmistaken about the habitual notions of the
imagination which perceive the substances and qualities of expressible
things by depending on expressive names, expressible referents, and
the connection between name and referent, since all such
conceptualizations are devoid of their apparent objectivities.
  
  The
Compendium of the Universal Vehicle states:

Thus, such a bodhisattva who strives to reach

pure information truly understands that those names made of letters,

the content of mental formulations that appear as letters and

meanings, are no more than mere mental constructs.


  He truly
understands that meanings based on letters are no more than mere
mental formulations.

  He truly understands that names are no more
than mere designations of substances and qualities.

  Therefore,
apprehending the fact that all are merely mental formulations,
and not apprehending any objective identifiability in nominal things,
with their ascriptive and descriptive designations, he enters
pure information itself, with regard to mental constructions of
apparent words and meanings, by means of the four thorough
investigations, and the four authentic realizations.


 Here, one might object that although this is a
negation of subject and object based on the constructions of mental
consciousness, there is no philosophical negation of subject and
object depending on the non-conceptual consciousness controlled by
instincts, so how can it be valid as entrance into pure information?
 
This is not a fault, because the rational negation of blue existing
by intrinsic identity as the basis of conceptual adherence which holds
the object dichotomously apart proves that the perception of blue,
in which "blue" appears as a basis of adherence, is mistaken in its
apparent object, since that appears to have intrinsic identifiability.

And that proof proves that that object "blue" does not exist as a
substance different from the consciousness in which it appears.

 Here again, one might protest that, when the ultimate status of
consciousness as the basis of conceptual adherence is rationally
negated, apperceptive self-consciousness, in which that consciousness
appears, is established to be mistaken in its apparent object, because
(consciousness) appears therein to have intrinsic identifiability.

  And
once that is established, the philosophy of the Experientialist
is demolished, since consciousness is without intrinsically
identifiable status according to actual experience.

This is not a fault, because consciousness does not appear in
apperception as a basis of conceptual adherence, although "blue"
does appear as the basis of the conceptual adherence insistent on
the externality of the blue in the perception of "blue."  

(The
appearance of something) being an object of adherence cannot arise
in apperception, etc., where dualism declines, which does not exclude
its appearance in the dualistic perception of blue.  The reason
that when a basis of conceptual adherence appears, it must appear
dualistically, is that whenever such a general notion arises in
thought, it definitely arises with a dualistic appearance.
Nevertheless, it is not the same in the case of this (apperceptive)
consciousness, because, although it also arises generally in thought,
it arises in the form of pure experience.  And one cannot say,
"It is the same since there definitely must be dualistic appearance
in constructive thought!"  because dualistic appearance in constructive
thought is not equivalent to the arisal of a (specific) object with a
dualistic appearance.  Otherwise, it would be necessary to admit the
impossibility of the occurrence of the decline of dualistic appearance
in constructive thought.

  And that is not correct, since then it would
become impossible for dualistic appearance to decline (in any
experience).


 It is not to be imagined that blue does not appear to non-conceptual
(consciousness) as the basis of conceptual adherence, since it is only
so established on the strength of mental construction (itself); because
(in that case) (a mound and tree) would not appear to non-conceptual
consciousness as illusory horse and elephant, since they are only
so established on the strength of mental construction.

 Therefore, the Elucidation of Intention statement that emptiness
(of the relative) with respect to the imagined, which consists of
ascriptive and descriptive designation, is the perfect does not fail
to negate substantial dichotomy between subject and object as well.

(Furthermore), that Scripture clearly states the negation of (the
reality of) external things, in the section on serenity meditation.

And it does not indicate the imagined reality in general, in which
there are many things, such as all universal characteristics, space,
etc., because these are not relevant in the context of establishing
the emptiness (of the relative), with respect to such (a specific
type of) imagined reality, as the perfect.

  Because, although those
many things have an existence that cannot be established by names
and symbols (alone), they have no intrinsic identifiability,
because they are merely conceptually constructed.


 As for the negation of subject and object depending on external
things, the Compendium of Universal Vehicle gives the reasoning


(associated with the similes of) dream and reflection, etc., the
Twenty gives the reasoning negating the indivisibility of atoms,
Dharmakirti gives the reasoning negating homogeneity in the production
of the characteristics of subject and object, and Dignaga gives the
reasoning negating the objective status of molecules and atoms.

 In regard to the Compendium of the Universal Vehicle statements
that all the Mother Scripture declarations of non-existence negate
the imagined reality, if we do not understand the Elucidation's
procedure to negate the imagined, we will interpret them as
(referring to) only the imagined reality which is substantial
difference between subject and object, and we will be forced into
many positions which are altogether incorrect even in the
Experientialist system, for it would be extremely difficult on such
an interpretation to explain the statements of the total
incomprehensibility of such things as permanence and impermanence, etc.

 It might even become necessary to maintain that the statements of
"total incomprehensibility" refer to the (time of) the
equanimity (of holy
wisdom), and the statements of "comprehensibility" through specific
discrimination refer to the time of the aftermath-discernment
(-wisdom); but saying this would be catastrophic!
 The Bodhisattva Stages, the Universal Vehicle Compendium,
and the Abhidharma Synthesis mention the four thorough
investigations and the four authentic realizations
  as the
determination of the view of pure information, and the antidote of
the objective obscurations, which are those mental constructions
which also serve as foundation for the addictions.
  And in order to
understand them, it appears necessary to understand exactly the
negatee, reification, and the reasoning negating the (reality
of the) imagined, as stated in the Elucidation of Intention.

Also, as it seems especially necessary to know the way of entrance
into pure information through negation of subject-object substantial
difference by the reasonings (above), I have merely opened the door
of analysis for the intelligent, having observed they have not yet
begun to investigate (this question).

##### ELIMINATION OF PROTEST

 Here, some might protest:  "(We might allow that) the
Elucidation of Intention states that the addictions are produced
by habitual adherence to the imagined reality in the relative,
evolutionary action is accumulated thereby, and thus one wanders
in cyclic life, and when the identity-unreality of the imagined in
the relative is seen, the sequence is reversed.

  (Further, perhaps),
all three, Disciple, Solitary Sage, and Bodhisattva, attain liberation
by this same path and practice, their path of purification and their
purity being the same, stated to be 'without a second,' with no other
pattern of emptiness of the relative with respect to the imagined
than that explained above.  But then, is the meaning of this Scripture
taken to be that the Individualists realize objective selflessness?
Or is it not?  If it is so taken, then the above explanations of the
distinctiveness (of the Universal Vehicle) are contradicted.

  And
if it is not so taken, how is the meaning of the Scripture to be
explained?"

 (Let us explain); the Bodhisattva Stages declares that ascriptive
and descriptive constructions, as well as materialistic constructions,
 create the ground of phenomenal fabrications, which are
(themselves) the objects of those imaginative constructions.

  On
that basis, the futile views arise, and thereby the other addictions
are produced and we travel around cyclic life.  And, when we know
that the objects held by the constructions do not exist, by means of
the four thorough investigations and the four authentic realizations,
this process is reversed.


 Thus, (Asanga) believes that the objective self-habit, which holds
ascriptive and descriptive designation to be intrinsically identifiable
in things, acts as the root of the futile views, just as those
Centrists who believe that the Individualists have no realization of
objective selflessness believe that the objective self-habit acts as
basis for personal egoism.


However, since, although the
termination of objective self-habits eliminates personal self-habits,
the non-termination of objective self-habits does not (necessitate) the
non-elimination of personal self-habits; the non-elimination of the
ultimate basis of the life-cycle does not preclude liberation from the
life-cycle.  Therefore, although we may take "this same path" as the
path of realization of the emptiness of the relative with respect
to the imagined reality, we need not take it as the path of objective
selflessness, because the Abhidharma Synthesis declares the
relative devoid of the imagined in terms of personal selflessness
also.

  Furthermore, the sameness of the path of purification and of
purity itself is declared because of the fact that there is no
difference between the Universal Vehicle and the Individual Vehicle
with regard to the purification of addictions through the realization
of personal selflessness and with regard to the liberation which is
the mere elimination of addictions.


 By implication from the Elucidation of Intention explanation of
the meaning of the Universal Vehicle Scriptures as being that the
establishment of the aggregates etc. is the relative, the reification
of objective self is the imagined, and the emptiness of that
(former) with respect to that (latter) is the perfect, which is
objective selflessness, we can understand the meaning of the
Individual Vehicle Scriptures as being just that arrangement
of the three realities which establishes the emptiness of the relative,
consisting of the aggregates, with respect to the imagined, which is
the personal self, as the perfect, which is personal selflessness.

Therefore, the disciple for whom the first wheel was proclaimed was
receptive to the realization of identity-realitylessness in terms
of personal selflessness, and not in terms of objective selflessness,
as the Elucidation of Intention explains by implication.

  And
that is the meaning of the statement that the wheel of Dharma of fine
discrimination was for the sake of disciples engaged in all vehicles.

 (Again, some might protest that) if, taking the relative as the
"empty" on all occasions of emptiness with respect to the imagined,
which is (either) ascriptive and descriptive designation (or)
substantial subject-object-difference, we must take the emptiness
with respect to the two ways of (imagined) existence above as
the perfect, then how is this reconciled with the statement of
Vasubandhu from the Supercommentary, in which, taking the perfect
as the empty, it is declared to be empty with respect to the other
two realities?  (As follows:)  "'Eye' means the ultimate eye.  'With
respect to the eye' means the 'imagined eye' and the 'constructed
eye.'  'Empty' is defined as 'free.'  The same should be applied to
such expressions as 'the ear empty with respect to the ear' "

 (Let us explain:)  the basis upon which objective self-habits hold
to (their notion of) objective self must be that which is taken as
"the empty" when determining the perfect, which is objective
selflessness, in any Experientialist or Centrist system.

  For
example, when we wish to eliminate the suffering of terror when
we perceive a snake in a rope, taking the rope as the empty, we
must show it to be empty with respect to the snake, and it would
be inappropriate to take the emptiness of the rope with respect
to the snake as the empty, and to declare that that (emptiness)
is empty with respect to the existence of (both) the rope and
the snake as different things!

 In regard to objective self-habits, such notions as the existence
of indivisible atoms, of objects which are their aggregates, of
instantaneous consciousness, temporally indivisible, and of
consciousness which is a continuum of such (temporally indivisible
consciousnesses), etc., are the conscious designations made only
by those whose minds are affected by philosophy, and exist only
for those philosophers, and not for other living beings.

  Therefore,
the demonstration of an emptiness which is the non-existence of only
those (notions) does not injure in the slightest the unconscious
self-habits inherent from beginningless time.  Hence, it is necessary
to demonstrate that the basis upon which unconscious self-habits
hold a self is empty with respect to the self supposedly held,
and we must understand the negations of philosophical designations
to be (no more than) factors of the negation of that (unconsciously
presupposed self).

 Through such considerations, since unconscious living beings perceive
a self in just this relative reality, which consists of internal and
external things such as names and forms, the objects of sight and
hearing, we must determine emptiness by taking that same thing as
the empty.

  Since the error (of living beings) is not in holding
the existence of the other two realities as different things in
the perfect, how can the formula "the perfect is emptiness with
respect to the discrete existence of the other two realities" be
the determination of selflessness?
 Furthermore, to hold to the existence of an objective self is not
(the same as) to hold to the existence of some other thing, such as
to hold to the existence of a fire on the pass.

  Since the
external objects and the internal subject of our own mind appear to
be disparate, and we hold them to be established (in fact) as they
appear, the remedy of that (habit) is the demonstration that the
appearance of subject and object is not established as a substantial
subject-object-dichotomy, and is not (simply) the demonstration
that subject and object do not exist there as different things.

 Therefore, the Discrimination between Center and Extremes
Commentary declares that (this pattern of emptiness) is not like
a temple being empty of monks, but is like a rope being empty
with respect to a snake, which statement also applies to the
pattern of emptiness with respect to objective self.

  Therefore,
if we contemplate emptiness in a pattern such as that wherein the
emptiness of the relative, which is the basis upon which self is
held, with respect to the imagined, which is the self as held, is
the perfect, and do not allow (ourselves to fall into the trap
described in) the popular saying, "Throwing the effigy out the west
gate, when the demons are causing trouble at the east gate;"

(then, that meditation) will act as an antidote to self-habits.
  But
if we contemplate emptiness in any pattern different from that
system, self-habits will not be disturbed at all.

 As for the explanation of the Supercommentary, the "imagined
eye" means the expressive verbal universals and expressible objective
universals which appear in constructive thought.

  The "constructed
eye" means the apparent eye whose nature is to hold those (verbal
universals etc. to exist) in the objective visual media; and the
"ultimate eye" is taken to be the perfect which is known by
equanimous, individually introspective intuition, free of
subject-object dichotomous appearance, and which is inexpressible,
free of expressive and expressible verbal and objective universals.

Therefore, since that ultimate nature of eye, according to the wisdom
of the holy equanimity, is free of (both) dualisms of apparent words
and referents and of subject and object, that object of equanimity
is said to be empty with respect to the other two realities, since
the former dualism (word-referent) is the imagined, and the latter
(subject-object) is the relative (as imagined).

 The same text continues:
The imagined eye is that thing called "eye" which
perceives things in the form of expressions and referents.

 The
constructed eye is dichotomous appearance of visual forms which
retain the nature of subject and object.

  And the ultimate eye
is the perfect reality which is individual introspection free of
all appearances, which is inexpressible, free of expression and
referent.

Thus, since, when you meditate on attention toward the ultimate,
things constituted by creation do not appear, you should understand
that they do not ultimately exist, but exist (only) superficially!

 Hence, (the statement of the perfect as empty of
the other two realities) is explained as the non-existence of
dualistic appearance according to the holy equanimity.

  Therefore,
this is not the way to determine the perfect, objective selflessness,
which is the basic view (of the system).

 The Supercommentary explains "ultimate existence" simply as
existence according to the holy equanimity.

  Nevertheless, how could
that be the ultimate existence involved in the argument about ultimate
existence and non-existence, since what is admitted by equanimity in
the realization of reality is only that admitted to exist as object
of its own particular subjectivity?  

The fact that this
(Supercommentary) definitely does not admit ultimate existence
capable of withstanding analysis by reasoning analytic of reality
is known from the expression of total negation specifically aimed
at such an admission in the section on emptiness-emptiness,
ultimate-emptiness, and uncreated-emptiness, but I do not cite
these, fearing prolixity.

 Finally, since the Mother Scripture itself, executing the analysis
of the three realities of each thing from form to omniscience, explains
the emptiness of the relative, the empty, with respect to the imagined,
the negatee, as the perfect, the ultimate, the "ultimate (eye)" must
be explained as the relative eye empty of the imagined eye.
Therefore, it does not seem appropriate to explain the meaning
of the Scripture as the emptiness of the latter with respect to the
two former, (even) in the context of the (holy) equanimity.

 (Indeed,) this (Supercommentary) is not the work of Vasubandhu,
because it negates the (ability of) both the relative and the perfect
to withstand analysis by reasoning analytic of reality,
 because
it refers to the Transcendent Wisdom Eighteen Thousand
Commentary's comment on the eight attitudes of the great personages
of the Individual Vehicle, and because it is in complete
disagreement with the explanation of the Principles of
Elucidation, in which Vasubandhu demonstrates that the meaning
intended in the Mother Scripture must be understood according
to the Elucidation of Intention.

  Rather, it was written by
Damstrasena, as was well-known to the scholars of the old school.


##### 3. THUS, THE PROCEDURE TO DISTINGUISH INTERPRETABLE AND DEFINITIVE
 Such being the Brother-Masters' method to explain the reality
of things, (to turn to the rule of interpretable-definitive,) the
Twenty states the intention of the first wheel's explanation
of subject and object in terms of the (existence of) external
things:  "Consciousness and appearance, each arising from its own
seeds;--the Muni declared there are two kinds of media, that
(of consciousness) and that (of appearance).
"

 Again, the same text declares the need (for the first wheel):
"(The Teacher) declared the existence of the media such as the
visible, etc., for the sake of the people disciplined thereby;
(he declared it) on the strength of this intention, as (on
another occasion he declared the existence of) a magically
created being.
"

 The teaching of the origination of consciousnesses, such as vision
of visibles, etc., from internal and external media was for the sake
of (producing) the realization of the non-existence of the perceiver,
etc., apart from those media;.
  The refutation of the literalness
(of this teaching) consists of the reasonings refuting external things.

Since the imagined, which is ascriptive and descriptive designation
of things, is included in the objective element and the objective
medium,
 the statement that (all media and elements) are
established by intrinsic identity, without differentiating those two
(i.e., objective element and medium), is interpretable in meaning.

 The Abhidharma Synthesis explains that the Extensive
(Transcendent Wisdom) declares the realitylessness of all things
intending the three unrealities.
  The Universal Vehicle Compendium
explains the second wheel to be interpretable in meaning, thereby
indicating the Mother Scripture and similar Scriptures, wherein
all declarations of non-existence indicate the imagined, all
metaphors such as illusion, etc., indicate the relative, and the
four purifications indicate the perfect.
  The Principles of
Elucidation refutes the literal acceptance of the explanations
of realitylessness in the Mother Scripture, believing it to be
included in the second wheel, as otherwise the Elucidation of
Intention interpretation of realitylessness would not be definitive
in meaning.

 The way in which this (second wheel of Dharma) is explained as
interpretable is quite different from the way in which the
declarations of subject and object in the first wheel are
considered interpretable.  For, the existence of the media of eye
and of visibles is declared intending the seed and the appearance
which each arises from the development of its own seed, called
"the instinct which evolves into visual consciousness," which
intentional meaning would not be suitable as the expressed meaning
of the Individual Vehicle Scriptures.
  On the other hand, the
three modes of unreality, which are the intended meaning of the
declaration of realitylessness (in the middle wheel), are explained
as the (express) meaning of the Mother Scripture.  Furthermore,
the existence of the external media is explained as the meaning of
Individual Vehicle Scriptures, whereas the belief in the ultimate,
total non-entity (of things), without differentiating the modes of
unreality, is not explained as the meaning of the Mother
Scripture.

 Therefore, (this system) does not explain that
the Mother Scripture is interpretable in meaning because it
intends the ultimate realitylessness of all things
without differentiation.
  Rather,
it explains that such (as the Mother Scripture's position) is
interpretable in meaning from the point of view of its need for further
explanation, since it is not fit to be literally accepted, hence is
not definitive just as it stands.

 Their method of further explanation is to explain the ultimate
realitylessness of imagined things as their non-establishment by
intrinsic identity, the ultimate realitylessness of relative things
as their non-establishment in that ultimate which is the pure object,
and the ultimate realitylessness of perfect things, which are
themselves the ultimate, as their non-existence as the objective self.

 Therefore, they do not believe that the disciples for whom the
Mother Scripture was declared are those who admit its literal
meaning, but rather they believe them to be those who realize the
meaning of that Scripture according to the explanation of the
Elucidation of Intention.
  Hence, the intentions of the last two
wheels are the same.
 The Elucidation of Intention clearly explains that, having, in
spite of one's admiration, refuted the literal acceptability
of the meaning of the Extensive Transcendent Wisdom, (one
discovers) another meaning beyond the literal, which other
meaning is definitive.  Thus, it calls the Mother Scripture
"interpretable in meaning," since it does not clearly explicate
that (other) meaning, and cannot be literally accepted.
  The
refutation of literalness consists of the above statement that
literal acceptance leads to the repudiation that holds all three
realities not to be established by intrinsic identifiability.

 The Principles of Elucidation shows the internal contradiction
in the literal statements of realitylessness, etc.:

The Transcendent Wisdom teaches repeatedly
such things as the realitylessness of all things, as well as
teachings such as (are included in the passage) from "the
bodhisattva wishes to enter the state of flawlessness"
up to "specifically repents all sins"  If the expressions
such as realitylessness, etc., had only literal meaning, they
would contradict all these other precepts.
  Since there would be
nothing at all to undertake, it would be impossible to accept that
from such a cause, such comes to be.  Or else, in regard to a
certain precept, one would feel "what is there to undertake?"
Therefore, such expressions are not to be taken literally.
  How
then?  (They are to be taken as) having a deeper intention.


 His rule of contradiction is mainly that, if there
were no reality, the relative would become impossible, insofar as
precepts, such as "if you wish to attain this and this, learn the
Mother Scripture," and the desire to attain, and causality,
such as that involved in the maxim, "from charity, great wealth
accrues," all would become impossible.
 Further, even those who accept the Mother Scripture as definitive
in meaning accept the repeated statements of ethical choice and
causality, etc., in conventional terms and not in ultimate terms.

Thus, while they do not believe in any general absolute non-reality
or conventional non-existence, they apply (qualifications such as
"ultimately," "conventionally,") in general, although the Scripture
does not employ such qualifications in each case.  Thus, this means
that even (these followers of the Mother Scripture acknowledge)
that causality, etc., become impossible if "ultimate non-existence"
(of everything) is literally accepted.
  And the Bodhisattva Stages
and the Compendium also negate (acceptance of) the ultimate
non-establishment of everything, explaining it as repudiation.

 Since the differentiation of interpretable and definitive meanings
of scriptural statements concerned mainly with the ultimate hinges
on the existence and non-existence of logical refutation of
literalness, we can answer this argument of (the Idealists) if
we know well how to negate ultimate existence, and also how to
establish with validating cognition causality and bondage-liberation,
etc., in things (whose absolute existence has been) thus refuted.

Otherwise, if we maintain that "if production were to be
established by validating cognition, it would become ultimate
production; but, as production is only according to the claim
of production by erroneous cognition, all things (such as production
of sprouts, etc.) are superficially valid," then, since we cannot
rebut their refutations, it would be preferable for us to depend
on the interpretations of the Experientialists.


 Although there are many approaches to the method of explaining
(Scriptures) as interpretable in meaning, intelligent persons
should understand that the Experientialist method of explaining
the second wheel as interpretable in meaning is precisely as above.
 The Elucidation of Intention declaration of the three types of
wheels (of Dharma) is not in terms of the assemblies in attendance,
nor in terms of the periods of the Teacher's life, but is established
according to the contents (of the Scripture); and they are (understood)
in terms of their determination of the meaning of selflessness.

 First, one wheel in Varanasi declared personal selflessness and the
real existence of most things, such as the aggregates, without negating
their truth-status, except in very few cases.
  Then, one wheel refuted
the truth-status of all things such as the aggregates without any
discrimination.
  Finally, there was one wheel of particular
discrimination through the method by which the first reality is not
established by intrinsic identity, and the latter two realities
are established by intrinsic identity.
  And other Scriptures that
teach subjects different from these are not involved in this
analysis of interpretable and definitive meanings.

 The Transcendent Wisdom Instruction explains:
Only those Scriptures whose meaning is literal
are definitive in meaning.
  No other meaning is contained in
such meaning, and its meaning is definitely just that; hence
it is "definitive meaning.
"  How is that meaning determined?
By that Scripture itself, by another Scripture, or by both
(itself and others).


 Examples of the first type (that determine their
own definitiveness) are the Mission to Lanka and the Elucidation
of Intention, etc., considering the fact that they clearly
differentiate the existence and non-existence of realities (of
different things), according to this belief.
  An example of the
second type is the Eight Thousand, etc., considering the fact
that they do not differentiate existence and non-existence of
reality as does the Elucidation of Intention.
  And an example
of the third type is the Eighteen Thousand, considering the
fact that in its Questions of Maitreya chapter, it contains
an explanation of interpretable meaning and an elimination of
the error of insistence on literalness, and the fact that the
Elucidation of Intention also explains its interpretable
meaning.
  This (distinction between the second and third types) is
made
essentially because the Questions of Maitreya chapter is absent
from the middle-length Transcendent Wisdom.
  Thus,
(Ratnakarashanti) believes that the arrangement of the three
realities in the Questions of Maitreya is the same in meaning
as that of the Elucidation of Intention.

 Such would be valid, were they in fact the same, but, since
Vasubandhu proved the Mother Scripture declarations of
realitylessness, etc., to be interpretable in meaning, by means of
the Elucidation of Intention, etc., the Brothers do not intend
that their demonstration of the inherent contradictions of the
Mother Scripture should be disproved by the Questions of
Maitreya.
  These two are quite similar and hard to distinguish,
but were they to be the same, (Ratnakarashanti) would become
an Idealist, since he could not possibly explain the intended
meaning of the Mother Scripture as the ultimate realitylessness
and conventional existence of all things.
  This subject, upon analysis,
is quite far-reaching in its implications, hence I will explain it
below in the Centrist section.

### CHAPTER III


##### THE ESSENTIAL CENTRIST MESSAGE

##### 1. STATEMENTS FROM THE TEACHING OF AKSHAYAMATI SCRIPTURE
 The Savior Nagarjuna and his (spiritual) son (Aryadeva)
did not differentiate interpretable and definitive by means of a
direct reference from a source in a Scripture differentiating the
two.
  Nevertheless, (the matter) is explained by implication from
the way in which they explain the meaning of the Scriptures.

Furthermore, the Lucid Exposition, the Wisdom Lamp Commentary,
and the Central Way Illumination 
 take the Teaching of
Akshayamati as authority, when they set forth the interpretation
of interpretable and definitive.  Therefore, that Scripture should
be taken as authoritative here.  The Teaching of Akshayamati
statement is:
Which Scriptures are definitive in meaning?  Which
are interpretable?  Those teaching superficial realities are
interpretable in meaning.
  Those teaching ultimate realities
are definitive in meaning.
  Those teaching various words and
letters are interpretable.  Those teaching the profound, the
difficult to see, and the difficult to understand, are definitive.
Those Scriptures that teach as if there were a lord in the lordless,
using various expressions such as "self," "living being," "life,"
"soul," "creature," "person," "humanity," "mankind," "agent,"
"experience," etc., are interpretable.  Those Scriptures that
teach the doors of liberation, the emptiness of things,
signlessness, wishlessness, inactivity, non-production,
creationlessness, non-occurrence, beinglessness, lifelessness,
personlessness, and lordlessness, etc., are definitive in meaning.

Rely on the latter, not the former.

 The first two phrases align interpretable and
definitive with the two realities in distinguishing them from
the point of view of subject-matter.
  The next two phrases do
not depart from this arrangement, since "teaching the superficial"
is teaching various meanings employing various expressions, and
"teaching the ultimate" is teaching the meaning that is difficult
to understand, which is the universality of the cessation of mental
fabrications.
  The last two phrases describe the methods of teaching
involved  in teaching the superficial and the ultimate.  To teach
as if self and living beings exist is to teach the superficial,
which does not apply to merely that, but also to all teachings
of the existence of functional things which require an agent.
  To
teach the emptiness and non-production of things is to teach their
realitylessness, and to teach the non-existence of living beings,
etc., is to teach personal realitylessness; and such a method of
teaching teaches the ultimate.  From the fact that both (persons and
things) are mentioned (as non-existent here), it follows that both
are shown to be existent in the former (superficial) teaching,
(although only persons are referred to there explicitly).
  The
teaching of the ultimate is not a matter of taking some other
permanent thing as basis and expounding it as non-production, etc.,
but is rather an indication of the truthlessness of such bases as
persons and things, such as aggregates etc., since the ultimate
reality is the mere exclusion of their truth-status.

 The Lucid Exposition explains that the (following) differentiation
of interpretable and definitive in the King of Samadhi Scripture
agrees with the above:  "The specialty of the Scriptures of definitive
meaning is known according to the teaching of emptiness by the Sugata.

And all teachings which mention 'person,' 'living being,' and
'creatures' are known to be interpretable in meaning.
"

 To be sure, Scriptures of interpretable meaning do "lead" disciples,
but that is not the meaning of the "to-be-led" (neya) (portion
of the term neyartha (interpretable meaning)).
  Rather the
meaning of the "to-be-led" is the process of interpretation, in which
it is necessary to "lead" the (obvious) meaning of the Scripture
around to a different meaning.

 There are two types of needs for interpretation.
  The first (arises
when a statement is obviously figurative, and) requires interpretation,
for example, the statement  "having killed father and mother"
wherein "father" must be interpreted as "evolutionary entanglement"
and "mother" must be interpreted as "craving".  The second (arises
when a statement lends itself to misinterpretation through a confusion
of realities), as, for example, when (someone misinterprets) the
statement  "from bad and good actions arise the effects of suffering
and happiness," by saying that its reality is just what is said, and
there is no other reality of those (actions and effects).

  (It then
becomes necessary) to explain that the (ultimate) reality of those
two things (can only be understood) by interpreting the statement's
obvious meaning otherwise.

 Therefore, the Central Way Illumination declares:  
 
 "How do we
define definitive meaning?  It is that which is explained logically
and in terms of the ultimate, since it cannot be interpreted by
others in any other way.
"

 If interpretable and definitive were to be equated with inexplicit
and explicit meanings, "logically" would be enough, but "in terms
of the ultimate" is stated, since the former is not enough.

  Therefore,
according to the (second) method explained above for alternative
interpretation of the meaning of a statement, such a statement as
"sprout is produced from seed," is interpretable in meaning, since,
although there are rational means of validation of its explicit
meaning, it is not in terms of the ultimate.
 Therefore, since the statement of the non-existence of true production
of things is logical and its explicit meaning cannot be interpreted
otherwise, as if it were not the reality of those things, Scriptures
with such (statements) are definitive in meaning, because they cannot
be otherwise interpreted according to either of the (above) two
processes of interpretation.

 (In sum,) the Scriptures themselves are taken as that characterized
as interpretable or definitive, being established as such according
to whether or not their meaning needs to be otherwise interpreted.

In this case, interpretable and definitive correspond to superficial
and ultimate, which (correspondence) is illustrated in the Facts
of the Stages declarations of the four reliances; reliance on the
teaching and not the teacher, reliance on the meaning and not the
words, reliance on the definitive meaning and not the interpretable
meaning, and reliance on the holy wisdom and not on (ordinary)
consciousness.

 The Ornament of Wisdom-Illumination Scripture declares that
"definitive meaning is the ultimate." 

  Since the Teaching of
Akshayamati statements of non-production etc. teach the ultimate,
only non-production etc. are the ultimate, and only indications
of that are to be accepted as definitive in meaning.
  It is not to be
supposed that, since on particular occasions the negatees are without
qualification, non-production etc. are not literally intended, hence
not definitive.  For, when such qualification as, for example in the
Hundred Thousand,  "It is in terms of popular conventions, and
not in terms of the ultimate," is applied to the production of
things on one occasion, it is to be understood as applied by
implication on other occasions also, and hence even those statements
which do not explicitly mention (such qualification) are literally
acceptable.

##### 2. EXPLANATION OF THEIR MEANING (SAVIOR NAGARJUNA'S EXPLANATION)
##### THE EQUIVALENCE OF RELATIVITY AND REALITYLESSNESS

 The Scriptures declare both the existence and the non-existence
of production and cessation etc., some of them explaining the
statements of non-production etc. as definitive in meaning, and some of
them explaining them as interpretable in meaning.
  If there were any
logical refutation of the literal validity of the explanations of
the non-existence of production etc. in the ultimate or by intrinsic
identity, then it would be correct to explain the objective self,
which is that negated in "selflessness," as merely the imagined reality
which is the intrinsic identifiability of things posited by ascriptive
and descriptive designation, and which is substantial subject-object
dichotomy, and to explain the ultimate reality as the absence of those
(selves).

  However, there is no such refutation, because the existence
of reality established in the ultimate, or by intrinsic identity,
would utterly preclude the dependence of effects on causes and
conditions.

 Therefore, in the face of the fact of the non-existence of
establishment by intrinsic identity because of dependence on
conditions, if we insist that, without intrinsic identifiability,
bondage-liberation, action-abstention, and cause-effect, etc.,
would become non-existent, then that is to take the ultimate proof
of emptiness of intrinsically identifiable reality as its ultimate
refutation!  This explanation is the system of the Champions founded
by the Savior Nagarjuna, which teaches the reasoning proving that
the meaning of the Mother Scripture and those Scriptures that
agree with it cannot be otherwise interpreted but is definitive
in itself, and teaches the reasoning refuting the literal validity
of those Scriptures that disagree with it.

 As for the Elucidation of Intention statement that those who
see no intrinsically identifiable status (in things) hold the view
that repudiates all three natures, it does not refer to everyone
who sees in that way, but only to those disciples who lack superior
intelligence.  

Therefore, the Teacher declared such according to
the mental capacities of the disciples, and not as His own belief.

For, since the disciple of superior intelligence realizes emptiness
with respect to intrinsic identity from the necessity of establishment
of causality itself, such a vision (of absence of intrinsic identity)
becomes a method to negate views which repudiate reality.

  (However),
for the (less than superior) disciple, the Mother Scripture becomes
interpretable, and the Elucidation of Intention definitive in
meaning, just as (Aryadeva) states in the Four Hundred that it
is better to teach "self" than to teach "selflessness" to the
disciple who is not properly receptive to the teaching of
selflessness.

 The Wisdom mentions the argument that (attempts to) refute the
literalness of the Mother Scripture etc., which argues "all
arrangements of life and liberation would be invalid, since production
and destruction of things are impossible if they are empty of
intrinsically identifiable reality," (as follows:)  

"If everything is
empty, there will be no production and no destruction, and the
consequence of the non-existence of the Four Holy Truths will be
inevitable for you!"

  To which (Nagarjuna) answers:  
  
  "If
everything is not empty, there will be no production and no
destruction, and the consequence of the non-existence of the Four
Holy Truths will be inevitable for you!"


 He states that the import of emptiness of intrinsic reality is
equivalent to the import of relativity, since in the case of
non-emptiness of intrinsic reality, relativity, which is production
and destruction, would be impossible, and all arrangements would be
invalid; whereas all these are very much appropriate in the case of
emptiness of intrinsic reality.

 Through logical determination of this very rule in the Centrist
treatises, the Master (Nagarjuna) explains that there is not the
slightest logical refutation of the literalness of the Scriptures
that declare the truthlessness of production etc., and since there
is no other way to explain them as interpretable, they are very much
established as definitive in meaning.

  Intending this, the Lucid
Exposition declares:  "The Master composed this Centrist treatise
in order to show the difference between Scriptures of interpretable
meaning and those of definitive meaning.
" 

  Thus, (Chandrakirti)
answers the objection that statements of the existence of the eight
(properties), from cessation to diversity, and the statement of their
non-existence (in the description of relativity), are mutually
contradictory.

  He then continues:

Not knowing the intention of such teachings,

one feels doubt; 

"Herein, which is the teaching whose meaning
is true?  Which is the teaching with ulterior intention?"


Some of lesser intelligence understand interpretable meaning
as if it were definitive.  Hence, the Master composed this
treatise, in order to clear away both doubts and confusions
through references and reasoning.


 The Scripture Synthesis answers the question
about the profound by quoting the Scriptures that teach the profound
such as the Hundred Thousand, the Diamond Cutter, and the
Seven Hundred, etc.  Further, the Canon of Reason makes certain
the impossibility of interpreting the meaning of these (Scriptures)
otherwise than taught.

  Therefore, (the Master) believed these to
be definitive in meaning, and statements differing from them to
be intentional.

 The Disclosure of the Spirit of Enlightenment declares that the
statements that negate external things and establish reality in mind
alone are not literally intended:  "The Muni declared--'All these
things are only mind!'--in order to eliminate the fears (of emptiness)
of the naive.  (Nevertheless,) that is not the reality (of things).
"

  (Finally,) the Jewel Garland declares:
Just as the grammarians make one read the grammar,
the Buddha teaches the Dharma according to the tolerance of the
disciple.  To some He teaches the Dharma to refrain from sins,
to some to accomplish virtue, to some as dependence on dualism,
and to some as freedom from dualism; (finally) to some He teaches
the profound, terrifying practice of enlightenment, whose essence
is emptiness and compassion.


 The first sentence states that the Teacher teaches
the Dharma in accord with the intelligence of the disciple.  The next
two phrases refer to the teachings concerned with ascendant status 5

(in the world).
  The next phrase refers to the teaching of the
non-existence of personal self and of the existence of both subject
and object for those in the class of the two disciple schools.
  The
next phrase refers to the teaching of the existence of the emptiness
of duality, i.e., the non-existence of the subject-object dualism,
for certain disciples in the Universal Vehicle class.
  The rest of
the passage refers to the teaching of the awesome Dharma of
(integrated) realitylessness and great compassion for the disciples
of extreme intelligence who are oriented toward the Universal
Vehicle.

 Therefore, as long as we are not capable of the establishment of all
arrangements such as bondage-liberation etc. upon the doctrine of
truthlessness, we must differentiate some things which are untrue from
some things which are true.  For it is necessary to lead (such
disciples) gradually, by teaching partial aspects of selflessness,
and it is not proper to present universal emptiness when (it would be
misinterpreted to mean that) there is no basis upon which to establish
causality.
  Therefore, (the Buddha) declared the procedure of refuting
reality in persons and almost not refuting it in the aggregates, and
the procedure of refuting substantial subject-object difference and
not refuting the reality of the emptiness of duality (itself).


 However, when we are able to realize the very import of relativity
as the import of realitylessness, there is no point in making any such
differentiation, because we are quite capable of the admission of the
validity of all arrangements upon that very basis which is the negation
of intrinsic reality.
  Nevertheless, even for those in the Supreme
Vehicle class who are in little danger of nihilistic views about
causality etc. there are a great many who, while somewhat roughly
negating truth, the negatee, fail to negate it precisely.
  For, in
the face of precise negation, so many lose sight of the functional
basis of all systems verified by validating cognitions.
  Hence,
the Elucidation of Intention differentiation of interpretable
and definitive still appears to be an extremely skillful technique
for guiding a great many disciples to the Universal Vehicle.
 Finally, as that Scripture is explained to be teaching according to
its disciples, we can understand the teachings that agree with it, as
the same.  Thus, we can understand how Asanga, the author of the
treatises elucidating its intention, explains also according to the
inclinations of his disciples, and does not accept the meaning he
explains as his own personal interpretation.



##### CELEBRATION OF THAT FACT AS THE ESSENTIAL IMPORT OF ALL SCRIPTURES
 The Master praised the Lord in many treatises from the point of
view of His declaration of relativity, having seen this very declaration
of the equivalence in meaning of emptiness by intrinsic reality and of
relativity to be of the highest excellence, distinguishing our Teacher
from other teachers.
  (The Lord's declaration was:)  "By the very
reason that origination depends on causes and conditions, things have
no intrinsically identifiable reality.
"

 (The Master salutes the Buddha as follows,) from the Wisdom:

I praise that perfect Buddha, the Supreme Philosopher,
who taught us relativity, free of cessation and production, without
annihilation and permanence, with no coming and going, not a unity,
nor a plurality, (which is the) quiescence of mental fabrications and
is the supreme bliss!


Also from the Philosophical Sixty:  

"I salute
Shakyamuni, the Herald of relativity, by which law, productions
and cessations are abandoned!"
  And from the Rebuttal of
Objections:  "I salute that incomparable, perfect Buddha, who
made the declaration of the equivalence of meaning of emptiness,
relativity, and the central way!"

  And from the Inconceivable
Praise:  

"I salute the Incomparable One, whose wisdom was matchless
and inconceivable, and who declared the realitylessness of
interdependently originated things!"


 The first (of these quotations) declares that relativity is free of
cessation etc., eight (attributes).
  The second declares that it is
free of them by reason of being relativity.
  The third declares
that "relativity," the "central way," and "emptiness of intrinsic
reality" are synonymous.
  And the fourth teaches that cessation etc.
are free of intrinsically identifiable existence for that very
reason.


 All the Discourses of the Teacher proceed from the two
realities, the ultimate and the superficial.

  Since we will not
understand the reality of the teaching if we do not know the
differentiation of these two, we also will not understand the procedure
to explain the Discourses from the point of view of the two realities.

For, all teachings of various subjects which are dependently designated
and dependently occurrent, are in terms of the superficial reality,
and the ultimate is no more than just that emptiness which is the lack
of intrinsic identifiability by that reason (of relativity).

 The Emptiness Seventy statement is:

The peerless Tathagata taught this relativity of things 

because of the fact of their emptiness of reality.
  

The ultimate
meaning is no more than that, but the Lord Buddha correctly designates
all varieties of things, relying on conventional expressions.


 Its commentary explains that the ultimate "is no
more than that emptiness of reality of all dependently originated
things.
"  

Thus, since (the Master) accepts the ultimate reality in this
way, and establishes it as merely the exclusion of the self, the
negatee, in relativity, the ground of negation, the systems of both
the Champions agree, except for some differences on the qualification
of the negatee, and it is incorrect to establish the ultimate reality
in any other way.

  Furthermore, as for the belief in the truth-status
of that (ultimate reality) itself, the Wisdom states:  "Who
entertains the view of emptiness is declared to be incurable!"

i.e., that it is an incurable view, and the Transcendental Praise
states it to be ridiculous:  "Since You taught the nectar of emptiness
in order to eliminate all mental fabrications, whosoever becomes
attached to that (in itself), You find utterly ridiculous!" 

 Since the existence of relativity as nature-possessor and ultimate
reality as nature, i.e., as support and supported, is (presented)
according to conventional cognition and not according to the rational
cognition of immaculate equanimity, according to this latter there is
of course no contradiction, such as that of existence of a nature
without any nature-possessor, (since all duality is eliminated in the
pure-object-ultimate).
  And in regard to existence in the (other kind
of) ultimate, that involved in the analysis of the reality of things
existent by intrinsic identity, since an isolated nature cannot remain
without a nature-possessor, the former (Idealist) system maintains
that if the relative reality were empty of intrinsic identifiability,
the perfect would also become unestablished by intrinsic identity.

Moreover, this system declares, "Since the created is not established,
how can the uncreated be established?"  Thus, both systems agree
repeatedly with the scriptural statement, "If form itself were not
apprehended, how could the reality of form possibly be
apprehended?"

 (Finally), the statements in the Philosophical Sixty that
"liberation is the only truth," i.e., that it alone is true, and that
created things are false and prove to deceive, must be understood
by interpreting the meaning of "false" and "untrue" as "deceptive,"
and the meaning of "true" as "non-deceptive."  Hence the "truth" in
question here is not that truth which is established by intrinsic
identity, which is in question during the analysis of establishment
and non-establishment in reality.
  These created things are said
to be "false," or "deceptive," as they deceive the naive-minded
by appearing to be established by intrinsic identity, when in
fact they are not so established, as for example, (someone) is said
to be deceiving if he pretends to be helpful, when he is not really
helpful at all.
  Similarly, liberation, the ultimate reality, is said
to be "true," or "non-deceptive," because it is not deceptive by
appearing (to be established by intrinsic identity), as in the former
case (of the superficial), to the person who directly beholds it.


 The heterodox schools, who do not believe in the relativity which is
the dependent origination of persons and things, but believe in the
truth (-status) of those two, fall into the abyss of the absolutistic
and nihilistic views.
  And those orthodox schools who, in spite of
their admission of the relativity of those two, believe in their
establishment in reality or by intrinsic identity, also come under
the influence of absolutistic and nihilistic views.


 Therefore, (Nagarjuna) believes that this very rule of the admission
that persons and things which are dependently originated are devoid
of intrinsic reality, like the reflection of the moon in water, is
the best door to the abandonment of absolutistic and nihilistic
views for those who desire to be free of them.
  

As the Philosophical
Sixty declares:
Those who insistently reify an independent self
or world--alas!--they are deprived by views (such as those of
things' being) permanent or impermanent.
  And those who believe
that dependent things are still established in reality--how could
they fail to be affected by the fallacies such as permanence etc.?
But those who believe that dependent things are neither real nor
invalid, but are like the reflection of the moon in water--they
are not deprived by views!


 Absolutism is eliminated by the fact of the
non-establishment in reality (of persons and things), and nihilism
is eliminated by the fact of the functional capacity of each thing,
as it is not invalidated by losing that capacity, (just because it
is not established in ultimate reality).
  Therefore, while admitting
the emptiness of the intrinsic reality of these internal and external
things, to maintain that such emptiness is annihilation of the
superficial contradicts the systems of both the Champions, who
emphatically maintained that relativity is free of both permanence
and annihilation.
  Nevertheless, there are many self-styled Centrists
who still believe that, or else hold the similar belief that
superficial things are empty even of their own entities, both beliefs
being misunderstandings of the meaning of the expression "self-empty.
"
They further claim that "there is no method that demonstrates to us
that these internal and external things of relativity are free of
absolutism and nihilism!"

 It is not surprising that the heterodox, who advocate the permanence
of things, should not admit relativity, believing things to be
established in truth, since that is the prescription of their own
teachers.
  However, the belief in the truth-status (of things), while
asserting relativity, which is the origination (of things) dependent
on causes and conditions, is utterly absurd.
  

Thus, the
Philosophical Sixty declares:

For the believers in "Being" who live by
upholding a supreme thing, to stay on such a path is not surprising
in the least.

  But, for those who believe in universal impermanence,

relying on the path of the Buddha, 

to dwell on upholding the supremacy
of intrinsically real things with arguments

--that really is astonishing!

 Thus he declares the absurdity of those who believe
that production and cessation etc. as defined cannot be reconciled
with non-existence in truth, or with (non-existence) by intrinsic
identity.


 Since this freedom of relativity from permanence and annihilation
is so extremely difficult to understand, the Teacher himself thought
that if he taught the profound teaching as he understood it, others
would not understand it, hence he should stay for some time without
teaching.

  As it is stated in the Wisdom:  "Thus, knowing
the profundity of this teaching to be so difficult to understand
for those of lesser intelligence, the Muni's heart was very much
averse to the teaching of the Dharma!"


 However, it seems that (Nagarjuna), the first great Champion, did
not (believe) this (realization) in itself to be that difficult, as
he explains that the difficulty of understanding is for those with
less than superior intelligence, for whom a misunderstanding of this
rule may be disastrous, (and not for those with the superior
intelligence).
  Thus, he goes on to encourage (us) by saying that
we should strive to understand the meaning of reality, avoiding
neglect of either both word and meaning or else just meaning of this
system, and avoiding the nihilism which finds no place to establish
causality etc.; as in the Jewel Garland (as follows:)
Thus, by such misunderstanding, one is ruined.

But by true understanding, one attains immediate happiness and
ultimate enlightenment.
  Therefore, abandoning repudiation and the
nihilistic view, make the supreme effort for authentic knowledge
to accomplish all goals!

; The Master's many other statements of logical
reasonings in his explanations of the profound meaning of the
Scriptures should be recognized as factors contributing to the
realization of this (rule of emptiness-relativity), and thus we
should train ourselves in the meaning of the central way.
  Finally,
since I have already explained this pattern of reasoning frequently
elsewhere, and since I intend to compose a commentary on the
Wisdom, I will not go any further here.

### CHAPTER IV
##### EXPLANATIONS OF THE FOLLOWERS OF SAVIOR NAGARJUNA
 The chief follower of the Master was Aryadeva, who explained the
system of the Master extensively in the Experientialist Four
Hundred, and the great Centrists, such as Buddhapalita, Bhavaviveka,
Chandrakirti, and Shantarakshita, accepted his authority as equal to
the Master's.
  Hence, the ancients called the treatises of these two
Masters "The Grandmother Treatises.
"  Here, we will formulate the ways
in which (those great Centrists) explained the ultimate intention
of the "Holy Father and Son.
"  There were many other brilliant sages,
such as Aryashura, and Nagabodhi, but their treatises on the Central
Way are not available in translation (into Tibetan).
  Thus, we will
explain the distinctive systems of those masters whose treatises
are available.

##### THE DOGMATICIST CENTRIST EXPLANATIONS OF THE HOLY TREATISES
##### I. MASTER BHAVAVIVEKA'S EXPLANATION

1. ULTIMATE PRESENCE AND ABSENCE OF REALITY IN PERSONS AND THINGS

 The Wisdom is the principal Centrist treatise by the
Master.
  It has eight major commentaries:  the Fear from Nowhere,
and those by Devasharma, Gunamati, Gunashri, Sthiramati, Buddhapalita,
Bhavaviveka, and Chandrakirti. 
  Avalokitavrata explains that
Bhavaviveka follows Devasharma's White Exaltation.

  As for
the Fear from Nowhere, in comment on the twenty-seventh chapter,
it cites evidence from the Four Hundred:  "As the revered Aryadeva
declares:  Very rarely does it happen that there are teacher, listener,
and that worth hearing.
  Hence, in short, cyclic life is neither
limited nor limitless!"
  This means that the Fear from Nowhere
is not an autocommentary, as is also recognized from the fact that
not even the smallest fragment of its commentary is cited in the
commentaries of Buddhapalita, Bhavaviveka, or Chandrakirti.
 As for Bhavaviveka's elucidation of the intention of the Holy Ones,
his explanation of the ultimate two selflessnesses becomes clear when
his determination of the three realities is understood.

 According to the Wisdom Lamp:
Now if it is suggested that the reality of the
imagined, which consists of verbal and mental expressions such as
"form," does not exist at all, such (a suggestion amounts to) a
repudiation of the facts, since it repudiates verbal and mental
expressions themselves;

(this master) believes in the existence of the
identity-reality in the relative since he explains that if the
imagined, suggested to be without identity-reality, is understood
as ascriptively and descriptively designative words and mental
constructions, both of which are classified among the aggregates,
then repudiation (of the facts) ensues, (which repudiation proposes)
the non-existence of identity-reality in the relative.  Furthermore,
since the Elucidation of Intention explains
identity-realitylessness as non-establishment by intrinsic identity,
and these (Dogmaticists) also determine the meaning of that Scripture,
it is clear that (Bhavaviveka) believes the relative to have an
intrinsically identifiable reality.


 In the Wisdom Lamp, (he formulates) his opponent's position:
"The imagined reality is identity-unreality since it is not included
in any of the five (categories); i.e., name, causal process, mental
construction, real knowledge, or reality.
"

 (This is) the position of the Compendium that the imagined
is not included in the five (categories), among which "name" is
defined as an anomalous creation and "causal process" is defined as
the imagined's designative base.  (The imagined) cannot be any
of the first four, as it is not a thing, nor can it be reality, since
it is merely conceptual designation.

  In regard to the Center
and Extremes' equation of "name" with the imagined, Sthiramati
explains that "name" here stands for its referents, and not the
actual name itself.

 Further, in all such expositions the "causal
process" equated with the relative includes only causes of created
things, although the Compendium states that among causes there
are also uncreated things.

  Thus, (acknowledging) that (for the
Idealist) the imagined is identity-unreality by reason of its
non-inclusion in the five (categories), nevertheless, (for
Bhavaviveka) such non-inclusion is not the meaning of
identity-unreality.


 It seems to be difficult to distinguish between (the positions of
Bhavya and the Dialecticists) with regard to conventional existence,
due to the fact that the treatises of this master are full of
expressions such as "non-establishment by intrinsic reality,"
"non-production by intrinsic reality," and "substantial
non-establishment," etc., and the Dialecticist treatises often
mention "reality," "intrinsic reality," and "intrinsic identity"
with reference to conventional existence.  Therefore, the above
explanation of the meaning of the existence and non-existence
of the identity-reality mentioned in the Elucidation of
Intention is the clearest source (for demonstration) of the belief
of this master in the conventional intrinsic identifiability of things.

 Therefore, he believes it possible to realize both selflessnesses
true to definitions, even without realizing the lack of intrinsically
identifiable reality in persons and things.
  As for the negatee
he posits as negated by the two selflessnesses, it is not merely
intrinsically identifiable status, as will be explained below.

 Furthermore, in the Wisdom Lamp, he shows the fault of
inappropriateness of example in the argument that the imagined
reality, being a referent designated by names and mental constructions
of any common person, and not (itself) a means of designation, is
without identity-reality, just as a snake designated in a rope
(has no identity-reality).


If you venture "the objects mentally constructed
by someone with both (name and concept) are non-existent, just like
the cognized snake in a rope," (then I reply that) the imagined
is not non-existent, since, although (in that case) the similarity
(between rope and snake) fools the cognition and the imagined object
does not exist there (in the rope), conventionally speaking the
(snake) is not non-existent in (some other) coiled snake (i.e.,
altogether).


This means that it is not correct to use
the non-existence of the referent of the designation "There is
a snake! (in a rope)" as an example of the non-existence (in things
such as form) of identity-reality of the referent of the ascriptive
and descriptive designations "This!" and "This is."  

For, the
opponent could reply that, just as the object of the cognition
"snake" exists conventionally speaking in a coiled snake, granted
it does not exist in a rope, the object of the cognition "form"
exists, conventionally speaking, in form, granted that the object
of the cognition "feeling" does not exist in form.

 Here, since "exists" and "does not exist" mean "has" and
"has not identity-reality,"  he is saying that the objects of
ascriptive and descriptive designations upon form etc. are not
without identity-reality, conventionally speaking.
  He states
that it would be contrary to common sense if there were no snake
in a coiled snake, "as if there were no object of the cognition
'This is a snake!' in a coiled snake, conventionally speaking.
"
(However,) he allows that an advocate of the central way may negate
things in the ultimate sense, meaning that if the object of the
cognition (in the form of) "This is a snake" of a coiled snake
were proved without identity-reality in the ultimate sense,
such would (accord with) the Centrist system.
  Therefore, he
continues in the Wisdom Lamp, if one wishes to show the
identity-unreality of the imaginatively constructed, which is
ascriptive and descriptive designation, one must admit the
reasoning of the Centrists.


 This reasoning is given in the Wisdom:  "Where the realm of
mind stops, there is nothing to verbalize.  Reality has no production
and no cessation, just like Nirvana.
"

 This is not to say that the Centrist reasoning is necessary in order
to negate the ultimate establishment in any round-bellied thing of
the entity posited there by the verbal designation "pot.
"  For,
as he states in the Blaze of Argument, both Experientialists
and Centrists agree in explaining that whatever is posited by
verbal signs does not actually inhere in the reality of things, since
such (non-verbal) persons as the deaf and the dumb can still
recognize things such as pots, and such animals as cows can
recognize their own and others' calves by means of smell and
color, etc.

 Therefore, the supposed objects of designations such as "This is
form!" and "This is production of form!" are (only) the meanings of
the designations.
  Conventionally speaking, they do exist by intrinsic
identity, hence do not have identity-unreality.
  So, by negating
(their) ultimate existence, he explains the meaning of the Scripture
as the non-existence of identity-reality in the ultimate sense.  Thus,
the object intended as the "imagined" in the statement "there is
no identity-reality in the imagined" is none other than the imagined
in the ultimate, and the statement that it is posited by names and
conventions merely means that it is verbal and conceptual designation.

Thus, he does not consider the relative to have been declared without
identity-reality, for, if the relative were not established by
intrinsic identity as actual process of ascriptive and descriptive
designation, it would be pointless even for the Experientialist
system to explain the imagined as identity-unreality.


Therefore, he maintains that the meaning of the Scripture is that the
perfect is the ultimate emptiness with respect to the substance and
production of form, and is not as the Experientialists explain it
(i.e., the perfect as the relative devoid of the imagined).
  Likewise,
this master believes that the lack of self-production, mentioned in
the declaration of production-unreality of the relative as lack of
intrinsic production, is synonymous with the lack of essential
production and lack of identifiable production mentioned in other
Scriptures, and he interprets all of them as meaning non-production
in the ultimate.  That being so, and real production being production
established by intrinsic identity, (it is clear that) he believes
in production established by intrinsic identity, conventionally
speaking, since he always employs the qualification "ultimately"
when he negates such (establishment) in things.
  In the case of
the Experientialists, however, while they accept the Elucidation
of Intention's "self-production" and other Scriptures'
"intrinsically real production" as similar in meaning, they
interpret both as lack of independent production, and thus believe
that such non-production need not imply ultimate non-production.

(Finally), since (Bhavaviveka) believes that the relative would have
to be established as it appears if it were to be established in
truth, invalidating the scriptural statements of illusoriness,
he explains the Elucidation of Intention as (teaching the
relative's) emptiness of intrinsic reality.

2. CONVENTIONAL EXISTENCE AND NON-EXISTENCE OF THINGS EXTERNAL

 Let us explain this (master's) position as to whether superficial
phenomena are objective (external things) or subjective (products of
consciousness).

  While the Holy Father and Son did not explicitly
pronounce upon the existence or non-existence of external things
on the conventional level, this master believes that external things
exist conventionally, that the sense-consciousnesses perceive things
in determinate form and not as indeterminate, and that both
(external things and internal consciousnesses) are sequential as
causes and effects.

 Thus, (he maintains that) the Ten Stages statement that "the
three realms are simply mind" is intended to refute any creator of
the world other than the mind, such as heterodox schools assert,
and is not intended to refute (the existence of) external things.

Further, since he believes that even this statement of the Mission
to Lanka--"The externally apparent does not exist, and a variety
appears in the mind, similar to bodies, belongings, and places;
(but) I say it is simply mind!"--does not refute external things,
one should reflect on whether he believes the refutation of
external things can never be the meaning of any Scripture. 8

 In the Wisdom Lamp,
 he explains the first statement (above)
as meaning that external things do not exist by intrinsic reality,
and that the "production of the variety in the mind, similar to
things such as body, belongings, and places" means the fact that
(the mind arises) having aspects (imparted by and) similar to those
things.

  He explains "simply mind" as above.
 (He further maintains that) it is not so that atoms do not appear
as objective  conditions of sense-consciousnesses when they aggregate
(with other atoms) as form and sound etc.  (He maintains that) armies
and forests, etc., are aggregations based on different types (of
atoms) and hence are not substantially existent; whereas molecules
of homogeneous atoms, dependent upon one basis, form (objects such
as) pots, etc., hence are substantially existent.

  He even
maintains that cognitions perceiving two moons, etc., would not arise
without an external objective support, since (such perceptions) must
arise based upon apprehension of one moon.

  (He argues that) if there
were no external (objects), scriptural declarations that
sense-consciousnesses arise from objective conditions would be
repudiated, since arisal from objective conditions would be
impossible either conventionally or ultimately.

 Therefore, he does not accept (the theory of) the fundamental
consciousness, for if he did, there would be no point in admitting
external objects, since the arisal of consciousnesses perceiving
objects would be derived from the development of the instinctual
propensities of that (fundamental consciousness), without any external
objects.

  Thus, since he does not admit that (fundamental
consciousness), he does not posit any addicted mentality, as he states
in the Heart of the Central Way, "the term 'consciousness'
definitely indicates the self.
"

 Further, he does not believe in apperceptive self-consciousness,
stating in the above text:  "How could any mind itself be perceived
apart from the perception of objects?"

  For, he refutes even in
conventional terms the following arrangements, which are clearly the
rule if apperception is admitted; that consciousness arises as a dual
perception in the forms both of external objects and of itself,
appearing as actual experience of the form of subjectivity not
apparent externally; that apperceptive self-consciousness is
experience subsequent to a prior objective perception; and that the
two, (consciousness and apperception), are (related as) objective
condition and subject (respectively).

  His system seems to agree
with the interpretation of the central way by master Jnanagarbha,
insofar as he also does not refute intrinsically identifiable
status (in things) conventionally, and he (also maintains) the
existence of external things.

3. THE MAIN REASON FOR NEGATION OF ULTIMATE EXISTENCE

 What is the main reason for negation of existence in the
ultimate, according to this master?  Except for occasional negations
by means of a negative reason, he (usually) refutes (ultimate
existence) by means of (the technique of) "perception of
inconsistent fact.
"

  (In) other (cases), considering ease
of examples that conform to reason and probandum, he sets forth
arguments such as the following:  "The eye does not see form
in the ultimate, because it is a sense-faculty, like the auditory
sense-faculty;" or "The earth-element is not the ultimate reality
of solidity, because it is an element, like water.
"
  Thus,
he emphasizes (the technique known as) "confutation through
similarity of reason,"
  which is often used in the treatises
of the Holy Father and Son.
  His intention is that if solidity
and sight of form were established as ultimate entities, then
differences of solidity and non-solidity in things similar (by
virtue of being) elements and of sight and lack of sight of form by
things similar (by virtue of being) sense-faculties would be
impossible, since reasons cannot be found to support such differences.

Thus, if (something) exists in the ultimate, it should exist on the
strength of its own objective condition, and not just be set up on
the strength of cognition according with its appearance.  Hence it
should be independently existent, requiring nothing else.  Therefore,
there would be no valid evidence to enable such differences (in
different things) to be discerned.
  For example, if smoke were to
occur independent of any cause, the absurdities that it could occur
from anything or that it could not occur from fire would become
obligatory.

 Thus if identifiable existence (of anything) were possible in the
ultimate, it would have to stand exclusive and isolated in its own
essence, as something apart from the actualities of cause, condition,
and aggregation.
  Hence, such things as elements and their composites,
aggregates of eight kinds of atoms, and mind and mental functions,
without mutual dependence, would not exist at all.
  Thus all things
which arise from combinations of causes and conditions and which
cannot exist apart from them must be stated to be ultimately and
substantially inexistent.
  He prefers to demonstrate the faults
(of ultimate existence) by showing that nothing may exist apart
from aggregation and that an ultimate existent would have to exist
independently, rather than negating (ultimate existence) as other
masters prefer,
 through the analysis of unity and multiplicity
of parts and wholes.

 Our intelligence will expand tremendously in reasoning (power) when
we thoroughly understand the key reasonings employed by the great
followers of the Holy Ones.
  Hence, we should learn thoroughly
this system's reasoning that if something were to exist in the
ultimate, the confutation of similarity of reason arises.

##### II. EXPLANATION OF SHANTARAKSHITA AND KAMALASHILA


1. ULTIMATE PRESENCE AND ABSENCE OF REALITY IN PERSONS AND THINGS

 Since Shantarakshita shares the position (expressed in
Kamalashila's) explanation in the Central Way Illumination
of the meaning of the Elucidation of Intention statements of
identity-unreality and production-unreality, which accords with
Bhavaviveka's (interpretation), he also believes in a conventional
reality established (in things) by intrinsic identity.

  This can be
understood also from their acceptance in common (with Dignaga etc.)
of the reasonings employed to establish causality in the Seven
Logical Treatises.

2. CONVENTIONAL EXISTENCE AND NON-EXISTENCE OF EXTERNAL THINGS

 Do external objects exist or not, conventionally?  The
Wisdom Lamp states:
Although some people first accept (the theory of)
pure information, and later wish to abandon it completely, it would
be better (to avoid it from the first, as it is better) to stay far
away from mud, rather than getting soiled and having to wash yourself
off.

  Therefore, it is correct to realize the selflessness and
non-production of consciousness just as one realizes the realitylessness
of external things.


 The Wisdom Lamp Commentary
 here explains
that this refers to the system of certain Experientialists, who first,
when still involved with superficial reality, negate external things
and accept consciousness alone, and later, when they wish to realize
ultimate reality, accept that even consciousness alone must be
abandoned.

  That is, it is better to teach realitylessness from the
beginning rather than first presenting one with the reality of (pure)
consciousness and later refuting such reality.

  This view that the
realitylessness of consciousness should be realized just as is the
unreality of external things clearly negates the idea of certain
Centrists that a disciple must necessarily be taught in such stages.

Accordingly, although the Wisdom Lamp's refutation of the position
"Those two should not be contemplated simultaneously but by stages,"
that "it is not necessary to be stingy about simultaneous meditation
(of both) from the beginning" is explained by the Commentary
(to refute) the belief of "certain Experientialists," (I) consider
(that belief) to resemble (Shantarakshita's).

  Therefore,
while such a system (as that mentioned by Bhavaviveka) does occur
occasionally (in works prior to Shantarakshita), still, master
Jnanasena's belief that master Shantarakshita, with the composition
of his major treatise, founded that Centrist theory that poses the
conventional non-existence of external things, is correct.


 To quote the Autocommentary of the Central Way Ornament:
Those who wish to answer all false criticisms
based on the premise of the fact of causality should investigate
the nature of those superficial things--"Do they have only the
nature of mind and mental phenomena, or do they have the nature of
external things?"--Concerning the latter thesis, some (do not
accept it,) saying--"The treatises declare 'mind-only' to refute
(the reality) of agent and experiencer (and do not mean it
literally).

"--while others (do accept it,) considering "What is
involved in causality is exclusively consciousness alone, and
whatever is objectively established, that resides in
consciousness.
"

 Here, Shantarakshita quotes from the Heart
of the Central Way, and sets forth the belief in external things
we have described above.  He records his own belief under "while
others considering".

 In regard to the authority of which Scriptures he relies upon, he
makes that clear in the same Autocommentary:  "Such an
interpretation
is in agreement with all the statements occurring in the Dense
Array and in the Elucidation of Intention etc.  We also
consider the Mission to Lanka statement appropriate--
'External form is non-existent--one's own mind appears as external
things.
' "

 Thus, depending on the method of "mind-only," one can understand
with little difficulty the realitylessness of personal self, personal
possessions, and the subject-object dichotomy.
  Subsequently, those
of no small intellectual might, with intense efforts, may analyze
that mind with respect to its (possible) natures of unity or
multiplicity and, thereby seeing no essence (of the mind) in the
ultimate (sense), may understand the central way that abandons
all extremes.
  According to the Ornament of the Central Way:
"The unreality of external things is to be realized depending on
the (principle of) mind-only.
  Thus depending, utter selflessness
is to be realized in that (mind) as well.
"

 He further quotes the Mission to Lanka:  "I explain
non-production as the reversal from cause and condition, the
negation of (external) causes as well, and the establishment
of the mind alone.  Things have no external existence, nor can
the mind be apprehended--in order to abandon all views, (I teach)
the nature of non-production.
"

 The Central Way Ornament Elucidation comments that the first
of these verses teaches the non-production of the Idealist system,
and the second teaches the non-production of the Centrist system.


The Universal Vehicle is attained through the doors of these two
methods, that of pure information through the emptiness of external
things in the conventional, and that (of the central way) through
the intrinsic unreality of all things in the ultimate.  The Central
Way Ornament continues:  "Holding the reins of reasoning, while
mounted on the chariot of the two methods, through the realization
of their meanings, Universal Vehicle status will be attained.
"

 Now as he must explain this system of the conventional non-existence
of external things as being the inner intention of Savior Nagarjuna,
which treatise of the Master does he believe to teach this?
 The Central Way Ornament quotes the following verses in order to
prove the non-existence of external things:

Herein is no production at all

Nor is there any cessation.


Production and cessation both

Are exclusively mind-only.

"Things called 'primary elements' etc.,

Are really included in consciousness;

And by that knowledge, there is freedom!"


Is that not a false presumption?

 The latter of these two verses occurs in the Philosophical
Sixty.
  The first verse teaches mind-only, while the second
answers the question about the mention of primary elements and their
material combinations by stating that it is the consciousness itself
that appears as such things, and thus they are included in
consciousness.

  Whether it concerns consciousness or external things,
the proposition that (either one) exists in the ultimate sense
is a false  presumption since they are not apparent to the wisdom of
reality.

 Now the Central Way Ornament Elucidation explains that the first
verse is quoted from the Mission to Lanka.

  However, Shantipa
takes both verses to be Nagarjuna's, and thus he believes  Centrism
and Idealism to be the same since the Master taught mind-only
also.

  It is evident that he was misled by Shantarakshita's
quoting of the verse in one continuum, but there are other instances
of verses by different authors being quoted in continuum.

 This system admits the reality of determinants (of cognition) such
as blue and yellow, and interprets Dharmakirti's position as being
the same--thus (Shantarakshita) is a Centrist who (is like the
Idealist who) believes determinant cognition to be conventionally
true.  He postulates apperception on the conventional level, and
although he does not clearly state whether or not he admits fundamental
consciousness, it is obvious he tends not to admit it.


(Incidentally,) the Pandit Sahajavajra states that the interpretation
of Lva-ba-pa puts him in the category of Centrists who (are like
the Experientialists who) believe cognitive determinants to be
conventionally false, since for him determinants such as blue
and yellow do not even have conventional reality.


3. EXPLANATION OF THE MEANING OF THE ELUCIDATION OF INTENTION

 Well then, does this system interpret the meaning of the
Elucidation of Intention according to the explanation of the
Experientialists?  Or, how does it interpret it otherwise?
 In the Central Way Illumination (Kamalashila) explains that
the Elucidation of Intention teaching that the ulterior intention
of (the statement of realitylessness is) the three unrealities is a
verification of the definitive meaning status of the Mother
Scripture etc.:
On that account, the Lord's teachings of non-production
etc. were declared only in terms of the ultimate.  Hence, by teaching
the ulterior intention (of the teachings) to be the three unrealities,
(the Elucidation) establishes their authority as the sole
definitive meaning, as (those teachings) show the central way
free of both extremes.


 Furthermore, (he continues), that teaching (of the
Elucidation) is declared for the sake of dispelling the mental
habits of reification and repudiation which prevent access to the


ultimate,--repudiation of the superficial reality (of things), and
reification of the existence of things which are (supposedly)
permanent etc., yet which do not exist conventionally, and of the
(ultimate) existence of form etc. as they appear.
  Repudiation
is avoided by refutation of the literalness of statements of
non-production by demonstration that such statements are made in
terms of the ultimate, and further by establishment of the need
for accepting the existence of production and cessation
conventionally.


 Experts accept the equation of the relative with the
production-unreality, due to the fact that things are produced
dependent on conditions and not from their own selves alone, with
the pronouncement that "the dependently occurrent is emptiness
with respect to self-existence."  Similarly, the Questions of
Anavatapta states that what is produced from conditions is not
produced with intrinsic identity--"What is produced by conditions
is not produced--there is no intrinsic reality of production
in it.
"


  Therefore, since it is produced from causes and
conditions, it is not necessary that the relative exist in truth,
for otherwise even false things such as illusions would be true
phenomena.
  And that is why the Elucidation of Intention
declares the relative to be "like illusion," intending that there
is no distinction between illusion and truthlessness.

  Therefore,
things such as impermanence when held to be ultimately existent
are imagined realities, which are stated to be identity-unreality,
since they are not established as they are represented.

  This (above
line of reasoning) avoids reification.

 It is not contradictory to explain identity-unreality as the
ultimate non-establishment of the relative, since (naive realism)
adheres to the reality of the imagined in the relative itself,
and hence it is necessary to demonstrate the absence of such an
imagined identity-reality in the relative.

 In regard to the fact that the Elucidation of Intention
explains the identity-unreality as being due to the lack of
intrinsic identifiability of the imagined (only) and does not
mention identity-unreality as the lack of intrinsic
identifiability of the other two realities, this master considers
that it signifies that the very same lack of ultimate status of
the other two realities is being explained as the identity-unreality
which is the lack of intrinsic identifiability of the imagined.

And, (for him) it is extremely clear that reification is avoided
by (taking) ultimate lack of intrinsic identifiability as the
meaning of identity-unreality, while repudiation is abandoned
by the fact that conventionally there is an identity-reality
which is intrinsic identifiability.

  Therefore, while this
master and the Experientialists agree (in asserting) that
causality is repudiated if the relative is lacking in intrinsic
identifiability, this master differs in his qualification that
the lack of intrinsic identifiability is "in the ultimate,"
while the Experientialists argue that if something has
intrinsically identifiable status, it must exist ultimately.

As for the meaning of the Elucidation of Intention
statement that the relative is empty with respect to the imagined,
since those phenomena of the relative are lacking in intrinsic
identifiability as the real referents of ascriptive and
descriptive designations of form etc. as "such and such," this
master maintains his belief in (the imagined as) the conceptual
object, just like Bhavaviveka (does) as explained above.

Furthermore, in the Central Way Illumination (Kamalashila)
interprets the statements of non-production, etc., as intending
the ultimate realitylessness which is objective selflessness.

To answer the argument that the statements of some Scriptures
that all things are realityless and unproduced etc. are
interpretable in meaning (since) the Elucidation of Intention
etc. reveal the ulterior intention of the Scriptures' meaning,
he states:

"therefore, the exposition of intention (of a
statement) does not preclude (that statement's) definitiveness
of meaning; 

because the very fact (that their intention is
exposed) establishes the statements of non-production, etc., as
definitive in meaning, eliminates any contradiction with
experience, etc., and gets rid of any assumptions of literalness.
"

To quote the Holy Elucidation of the Intention itself.


 "Therefore" is explained as meaning that all
things are exclusively without reality, due to the realitylessness
stated by the Elucidation of Intention as ultimate
realitylessness, being both ultimate and manifested by the
realitylessness of things.

  And this (above quote further)
explains that the Elucidation of Intention exposition of the
ulterior intention of the statements of realitylessness, etc.,
establishes their definitiveness of meaning by refuting their
literal acceptability.

  This system equates literal acceptance
(of "non-production" etc.) with the notion of utter non-existence
of production and cessation etc., saying that the Centrist admits
non-production in the ultimate sense, but accepts production etc.
in the conventional sense, and hence should not insist upon the
literalness of statements of productionlessness, etc.  It thus
equates admission of the ultimate non-existence (of production,
etc.) with the non-acceptance of the literal meaning (of such
statements).


 We might now object that, if such is the case, it contradicts
the Elucidation of Intention explanation of the second wheel
of Dharma, which teaches "realitylessness" and "non-production"
as interpretable in meaning, since (according to this position)
the Elucidation of Intention establishes those (teachings)
to be definitive in meaning.

 Although (Kamalashila) does (not) explicate the rebuttal of this
contradiction in the Central Way Illumination, his
intention is that, granted that there would be a contradiction if
one and the same Scripture was both stated to be interpretable in
meaning and also established as definitive in meaning by showing
its intention, not (only) one Scripture is involved, but (many)
Scriptures that are similar only insofar as they belong to the
middle wheel of Dharma.

  That is to say, teachings such as "There
is no form," in a Scripture such as the Transcendent Wisdom Heart,
where the qualifications "in the ultimate" and "in truth" are not
explicitly applied, are not fit to be accepted literally as taught,
and thus are interpretable, requiring further interpretation by
supplying the qualifications "in the ultimate" etc., since "eye"
and "ear" etc. are only non-existent ultimately and are not
non-existent conventionally.
  However, this analysis also means
that the Scriptures such as the Transcendent Wisdom Hundred
Thousand, which apply such qualifications as "in the ultimate
sense" to their negatees, are established as literally definitive
in meaning; thus, the statement that the second wheel is interpretable
in meaning does not apply to all (the Scriptures) of the second wheel.

 Now, the Elucidation of Intention refutes the (type of) literal
acceptance of statements of productionlessness, ceaselessness,
and realitylessness which holds "That is just so!", but does not
refute (the type of) literal acceptance which accepts ultimate
realitylessness etc.  Fitting these two facts together, (Kamalashila)
asserts that, while the acceptance of the non-existence of substance,
production, and cessation with intrinsically identifiable status
would be (erroneous) literal acceptance, this Scripture's teaching
of identity-unreality due to non-existence of intrinsically
identifiable status refutes the ultimate existence (of that
intrinsically identifiable status, and thus is definitive in
meaning).
  He (is compelled to) explain it in that way by his
crucial belief in the validity of intrinsic identifiability in
the conventional sense.
 In sum, he believes that the Elucidation of Intention
establishes Scriptures such as the Mother Hundred Thousand
as definitive in meaning, because the Elucidation of Intention
teaches that "of the two kinds of Scriptures taught in the second
wheel of Dharma to those devoted to the Universal Vehicle, those
that apply the qualifications such as "ultimately" and those that
do not, one should not take the statements of the latter literally,
but should understand according to the former kind that production
and cessation etc. exist conventionally and do not exist ultimately.
"

  By these reasonings, we can completely understand their method
of explaining the interpretability of the first (wheel of Dharma).

 If the meaning of this Scripture is not the formulation of the
three reality theory of the Experientialist, does (Kamalashila) believe
that no Scripture has such a meaning?
 In the Central Way Illumination, he states that when the
Elucidation of Intention, the Mission to Lanka, and the
Dense Array fail to refute intrinsic reality of the mind on
certain occasions when external objects are negated and mind-only
is established, they are teaching in accordance with the inclinations
of those who must be led gradually, being unable to realize all at once
the realitylessness of all things.

 Thus, he interprets the meanings of these Scriptures by
differentiating the above teachings from those teachings given to
disciples who are capable of realizing the realitylessness of all
things all at once.  And, although master Shantarakshita does not
explicitly settle the question of the three realities in the same
manner, (from) at least those of his works that have been translated
(into Tibetan), (it appears that) the intentions of both masters
are the same.
 The Central Way Illumination teaches in detail the style of path
founded by Bhavaviveka, in which the meaning of the Elucidation of
Intention statement of the three realities is interpreted according
to the Centrist, not the Experientialist, system.
  Knowing
the subtleties of both methods of scriptural interpretation, one
will understand the various techniques of reasoning and scriptural
interpretation of the Great Champions.

4. INTERPRETATION OF THE MAIN REASON REFUTING ULTIMATE EXISTENCE

A. IDENTIFICATION OF THE LOGICAL NEGATEE

 If one accepts only the conventional reality of intrinsically
identifiable status, then of what sort is the negatee, which is not
merely that (status), but is said to be "true," "real," and "ultimate"
status?

 It is extremely important to identify the negatee, as otherwise
there would be no clear awareness of either the mental habit holding
to truth-status, etc., (in things) or of the general (character) of
the negatee thus held.

  Then, our sense that such (truth-) status
(in things) is impossible would be merely a dogmatic aversion, and
no matter how often we assert "This is the fault inherent in such
status and this is the proof of its non-existence," we will reach
no solid understanding of the import (of these assertions).

 Commenting on the statement that "earth," etc., are not ultimately
the realities of the elements, (Bhavaviveka) says in the Blaze
of Arguments:

"Ultimate object" (paramartha) is called
"object" (artha) because it is a knowable (object), which is to
say it is something to be examined and understood.

  "Ultimate"
(parama) has the meaning of "supreme."  Thus the (karmadharaya)
compound "ultimate-object" (paramartha) is formed, as it is both
an "object" as well as "ultimate."  Otherwise, (analyzing the compound
as a genitive tatpurusa) it is called "object of the ultimate"
as it is the object of the ultimate, non-conceptual intuition.

Further, (as a bahuvrihi) (it means) "that conforming with the
ultimate," as that "ultimate meaning" exists for the wisdom that
conforms to the realization of the ultimate.

 Of the three (meanings) mentioned here, the latter
concerns us here (in our concern to understand "ultimate status").

Bhavaviveka continues:
There are two kinds of ultimates.
  One is
non-operational, transcendent, immaculate, and unfabricated,
and the other is operationally involved and endowed with
fabrication, known as "pure mundane intuition conforming to the stores
of merit and wisdom.

"  Thus, there is no fault, with regard to this
(latter kind of ultimate), as employed to qualify our thesis.


 Here, (we) must accept (as a type of ultimate)
the rational cognition analytic of the ultimate, not only (reserving
ultimacy for) the holy aftermath rational cognition.

  Therefore,
when the basis of the analysis of existence and non-existence by
the Centrists and other (philosophers) is said to be "non-existent
ultimately," what is meant is that that basis (objects etc.) does
not exist in the face of reason analytic of the ultimate, and that
such (rational cognition) does not establish them (as ultimately
existent).

  This (above) is the clearest explanation (of this point)
in the treatises of this master (Bhavaviveka), and (the type of
ultimacy involved) is not identified so clearly in the writings on
the two realities of master Jnanagarbha, nor in the Central Way
Ornament and its Autocommentary.

 In the Central Way Illumination, the three wisdoms are termed
"ultimate," since their object is the ultimate reality:

All cognitions arising from hearing, contemplating,
and meditating upon (the meaning of) reality are termed "ultimate"
because they have the object which is undeceiving, and because the
aim of these (cognitions) is ultimate.  

They may further be
distinguished as either direct or (inferentially) indirect,
and by the force of their considerations all these (mundane) things
are known to be exclusively unproduced (ultimately).

  Therefore,
the expression "(Things are) ultimately unproduced" means that
they are not established by these authentic cognitions.


 (Things are) said to be unproduced on the strength
of the consideration of these (cognitions), since they are not
established as produced according to (these) authentic cognitions.

The two selflessnesses are "ultimate" as they are corroborated by
(correct) reasoning, and are "objects" as they are the objectives
of those aspiring to realization and abandonment of obscurations
and are the aims of infallible ultimate intuition--hence they are
taught as having the nature of the "ultimate object.

"  Accordingly,
if "reality" is taken as rational cognition, it, and not conventional
cognition, negates intrinsic reality.

  And, if "reality" is taken as
actual ultimate reality, ("ultimate" existence) does not exist
according to analysis of ultimate reality.

  This is explained in the Subcommentary of the Ornament.


 This indicates that things such as production, etc., are not
established as the actuality of things, for if such production
of things was to exist in actuality it would have to be established
by cognition of the true and the ultimate, and it is in fact not
so established--and that very fact is also termed "ultimate
non-production.
"

 How would production have to be established to be established in
actuality?  For example, when one sees in hallucination a tree or
a boulder as an illusory horse or an illusory bull, although such
things merely appear to such (distorted) cognition, one cannot say
that that tree does not appear to be such (as a horse).

  Likewise,
when a sprout appears to be produced from a seed, although such is
no more than  an appearance to (visual) cognition, it cannot be
said that that sprout does not arise from that seed (at all).
  If
that is the case, is that not "ultimate production," since objectively
the sprout is produced from the seed?
 This does not fault (Kamalashila's position), for, although there is
an appearance of horse or bull, as far as the source of the mistake
(i.e., tree or boulder) is concerned, such an appearance is on the
strength of the cognition of hallucinating vision, and is not
produced from its own natural conditions; otherwise, it would appear
even without any hallucination.
  Likewise, in the case of the seed's
production of the sprout, it is not on the strength of its own mode
of existence and is only presented on the strength of its appearance
to conventional cognition.
  Therefore, the perception of the production
of the sprout on the strength of its own inherent condition, not merely
as presented on the strength of appearance to its (corresponding)
subjective cognition, would be the perception of ultimate production.

And thereby can be known (what is meant by) "existence of ultimate or
true production"; and thereby can be understood the (problem of)
existence and non-existence of ultimate, real, and true production
of all other things.

 The Central Way Illumination states that "All living beings
perceive such a real, inherent self in things as is indicated
(by such conditioning), and thus all things distorted by their
cognitions (of this type) are said to exist only superficially.
"

 The superficial cognition that mistakenly perceives (things')
existence where there is ultimate unreality, and which arises from
beginningless instincts, pretends to all living beings as if there
were a true existence of things, and thus what exists according to
their thoughts is said to be "superficially existent.
"  As ultimate
existence is taken as the reverse of that (type of existence presented
by falsifying cognition), it is explained in relation to it.
  And,
(on this point), the systems of all the Dogmaticist Centrists are
similar.

 (In regard to criteria of validity within the superficial,) although
conventionally existent (things) cannot be established (merely) on the
strength of appearance in non-analytical cognitions such as the two
unconscious self-habits, they can be established conventionally on
the strength of their appearance in conventional cognitions which
are not faulted by other validating cognitions.
  Thus, in the system
of this master, although there is such a thing as a conventional
reality established on the strength of appearance to such (unfaulted,
conventional) cognition, it must be qualified as "not (merely)
established on strength of appearance to purely subjective cognition.
"
Although he does indeed admit the ultimate reality of those emptinesses
which are the emptinesses of those (conventional) objects with
respect to the (hypothetical) objects of truth-habits, those
(emptinesses themselves) are not established on the strength of
(objective) realities which (themselves) are not established on the
strength of their own appearance to their corresponding subjectivities.

This is how to understand the meaning of "emptiness of emptiness"
(in this system).

 The above-mentioned "truth-habit" is the unconscious truth-habit
of this system, which does exist for living beings unacquainted
with signs, although not by way of connection of name and referent.

Therefore, although one can (refute its intellectual objects by)
arguing that if the object of the
truth-habit were to exist, then it could withstand analysis by
reasoning analytic of the ultimate, indivisible things would exist,
and  (so would) intrinsic reality with the three qualities 63
 etc.,
the (philosophical) holding of such (untenable positions) is not the
(only) function of the truth-habit, since their refutation (by
itself) does
not establish the actual (experience) of truthlessness.

 Due to the fact that imprecise identification of the object of the
truth-habit of this (master) entails the granting of truth-status
to every object of rational cognition, certain scholars of former
times adopted such a belief (in truth-status).
  Others asserted
the utter absence of any object of rational cognition.
  And still
others asserted the existence and non-existence of the objects
(of rational cognition) by distinguishing between the (differentials)
of "reason" and "inference."

 In conclusion, having identified this unconscious objective
self-habit, one understands all reasonings negating objective self
as either its actual negation or as a factor of it.
  One should
understand the thrust of this (practical) teaching  as (inculcative
of) repeated analysis of whatever is internalized in the patterns
of one's own mental processes, through learning, teaching, and
thinking (upon this matter).
  Indeed, ultimately, such an attitude
is required on all other occasions of the expositions of
selflessness by any of the Buddhist (philosophical) schools.

B. REASONING NEGATING THE NEGATEE

 What is the chief reasoning used to negate the above negatee?
 With some exceptions, the reason used to negate the negatee of this
system is the reason (called) "non-perception of the related fact.
"

  Nevertheless, the Central Way Ornament, relying on the
Mission to Lanka and the Meeting of Father and Son, expounds
its proofs by means of the reasoning known as "absence of (true) unity
and multiplicity,"  and the Central Way Illumination employs
(the reasonings known as) "the diamond-smithereens," "negation of
production from existent (causes) or non-existent (causes),"
"negation of production through four alternatives," and "absence of
unity and multiplicity.
"  It finally employs the "reason of
relativity" which is a reason (defined as) "perception of the
inconsistent fact.
"

 The conclusive scope of the demonstration of the internal
contradiction in an opponent's (position affirming ultimate existence)
is as follows:  the absolute status of anything is refuted by showing
first of all, in the face of no matter what assertion of Buddhist or
non-Buddhist school, the impossibility of an indivisible, a thing
without a multiplicity of parts such as periods of time, parts of
physical objects, or aspects of cognitive objects.
  Then one
demonstrates that, whereas conventional objects may exist as unitary
things while established as composed of many parts, as far as absolute
status is concerned, there are inevitable inconsistencies.
  If part
and whole are ultimately different, there can be no connection
between them, and if part and whole are absolutely the same, then
the whole becomes a multiplicity.
  (Shantarakshita and Kamalashila)
expound (such arguments), being thoroughly conversant with reasonings
such as that of Aryadeva, i.e., "There is no finger apart from the
joints etc." 

 To exemplify (their more full line of reasoning) as in the Central
Way Illumination, "to refute (ultimate) production of one thing
from another, (first) the (cause) is restricted to being either
permanent or impermanent, and then production from a permanent thing
is refuted.
  Then, (production from) an impermanent thing is restricted
to being either simultaneous or sequential, and production from a
simultaneous (cause) is refuted.
  Then, a sequential (cause) is
restricted to being either destroyed or undestroyed (in its production
of effect), and production from a destroyed (cause) is refuted.

Then production from a formerly undestroyed cause is restricted to
being either obstructed or unobstructed, and production from an
obstructed (cause) is refuted.
  The refutation thus far is rather
simple.  Then production from an unobstructed (cause) is restricted
to being either wholly unobstructed or partially unobstructed;
then, in the former case, there must be a confusion of two things
occurring at different times, and an atom and (its aggregative
effects such as) a molecule must be confused as single object, 68

(the causal atoms) being wholly unobstructed; or else in the latter
case, as (the supposed indivisible cause, being 'partially'
unobstructed) would have parts, it would be a superficial
(production, no longer absolute).
" 

 Further, the conclusive scope of the demonstration of inconsistencies
(in the advocacy of ultimate production) lies in the refutation
through the analysis of sameness and difference in wholes and parts.

Thus, there are many doors of reasoning demonstrating the faults of
such (assertions) as (ultimate) production from something else.
 The ultimate refutation accomplished by master Jnanagarbha in his
Analysis of the Two Realities, where his actual reasoning negating
truth-status is the refutation of (ultimate) production through four
alternatives, is quite similar to those (above-mentioned) of
Shantarakshita and Kamalashila.

 (Finally), all of these (reasonings) are the great paths of
philosophical analysis of the followers of Savior Nagarjuna, and thus
should be learned by those who wish to expand their intelligence
in reasoning.
  And if one understands the reasonings of these (masters)
of the Dogmaticist school, one will easily understand the reasonings
in the other (schools), so there has been no digression.

### CHAPTER V

##### DIALECTICIST ELUCIDATION OF THE HOLY INTENTION

##### THE QUESTION OF INTRINSIC REALITY IN PERSONS AND THINGS

1.
  THE DISTINCTIVE SPECIALTY OF THEIR NEGATION OF INTRINSIC REALITY IN PERSONS AND THINGS

2.
A.
  THE DISTINCTIVENESS OF THEIR NEGATION OF INTRINSICALLY IDENTIFIABLE INTRINSIC REALITY
  
 Bhavaviveka found many faults with Buddhapalita's explanation
of the Wisdom, but he did not criticize him out of disagreement
over the two selflessnesses.

 Avalokitavrata explains:

The great teachers of the central way, the Holy
Father and Son, Bhavaviveka, and Buddhapalita, all show the method
of the Transcendent Wisdom by explaining that inner and outer
relativity exists conventionally, functionally efficient as mere
illusion, and does not exist ultimately, being without
substantiality.


 (In effect, he considers that) both masters
(Buddhapalita and Bhavaviveka) explain the patterns of ultimate
reality and of illusory, conventional existence in the same way.

Furthermore, Jnanagarbha, Shantarakshita, and Kamalashila do not
propose any difference between the selflessnesses of their systems
and those of the system of Buddhapalita and Chandrakirti.
Chandrakirti, (on the other hand), while accepting that Buddhapalita,
through correct interpretation of the intention of the Holy (Masters),
presents the ultimate and the conventional without differing from
his own system, still insists that his (and Buddhapalita's) system
is distinct from the systems of the other Centrists.

  Thus, in the
Introduction to the Central Way Commentary, (he states):

Let the experts please be certain that what we
expound here in the course of our rebuttal of any other system
accords with the doctrine of emptiness, and that such is not the
case with other treatises, just as (they are certain that) this
doctrine known as "emptiness" is not taught flawlessly in any treatise
other than the Wisdom.

  And thus, the proposition advanced by
some, that "the Centrists conventionally accept the very same
things for which the Traditionists posit ultimacy," should be
recognized as merely an expression of utter ignorance of the
actual meaning of the Central Way Treatise. 

 He then goes on to quote and dismiss a similar
statement about the Analyst system (and the Centrist system),
and he finally concludes:  "Thus, since it is inappropriate
that (this) transcendental doctrine should resemble (in any way)
a mundane doctrine, experts may be certain that this system is
distinctive (from all others).
"

 He argues for the distinctiveness of his own system from that of
other Centrists and attributes their belief that the Realists'
absolute is the Centrists' conventional to their ignorance of the
actuality of the central way.

  His reason is that in his own system
nothing is admitted to be established by intrinsic identity, even
conventionally, and those (Realists) establish (everything, ultimate
and superficial) on that basis only.

  Since if either of the two
realities is confused the other will be confused, it is incorrect
that the transcendental teaching which does not confuse the two
realities should resemble a mundane teaching which does confuse
them both.

  Thus, this system of the Holy Masters has nothing
in common with the Realists' theories, not only with regard to
the ultimate but even with regard to the superficial.

 Now when (Jnanagarbha, in) the Autocommentary of the Analysis
of the Two Realities quotes the verse:  

"What is absolute for one
is superficial for another; 

just as (the same woman) is regarded
as mother by one and wife by another;"


 and the Subcommentary
 identifies the verse as being Nagarjuna's, it is (obvious) from
(the above passage of) the Introduction Commentary that such
is not the case.  As for the allegation that Shantarakshita wrote
the (above) Subcommentary, while it may be a case of (another
author with) the same name or a case of borrowing the name, it is not
(the Shantarakshita who is) author of the Central Way Ornament,
etc.  

For, (not only does Kamalashila) refute, in his Compendium
of Principles Elucidation,
 this author's explanation of the
purpose of composing a treatise, (which he would not do if it was his
own master's explanation), (but also) this author approves the
literal meaning of the statement of (Jnanagarbha in) the
Autocommentary to the effect that the theory of the non-existence
of the apparent subject-object (-duality) is contradicted by perception
and refuted by common sense, (which is precisely opposed to the
position of Shantarakshita).

 Furthermore, it is incorrect to object that "if the difference between
the negatees of the two Centrist schools were no more than that,
(presence and absence of intrinsically identifiable production
conventionally), why does Chandrakirti not make a specific refutation
of that (insistence of the Dogmaticist on conventional, intrinsically
identifiable production)?"

  (For, in fact, Chandrakirti does just
that) in the Introduction Commentary, (first formulating the
Dogmaticist argument as follows):

It is fine to negate production from self and
other since there is no ultimate production, 

but it is undoubtedly
the nature of the objects of perception and inference such as
form and sensation, etc., to be produced from something else
(conventionally).

  If you do not admit that, why mention two
realities, as there would only be one reality left?  

Thus,
production from something other does indeed exist.


 The objection is that, while in the negation
of intrinsically real causality it is proper to negate
other-production in the ultimate, "real" or "intrinsically
identifiable"  other-production must be admitted conventionally,
or else the superficial reality would be annihilated.

  To rebut
this, (Chandrakirti) methodically proves the non-existence of
identifiable production in both realities.

  And this is
established to (counter) the (Dogmaticist) Centrist theory
that intrinsically identifiable production exists conventionally,
though not ultimately, and is not (directed) at (any theory of)
the Realists.

B. DESCRIPTION OF THE NEGATEE AND PROOF OF ITS NON-EXISTENCE
.
B 2.
a.
##### HABITUAL MODES OF INTELLECTUAL AND UNCONSCIOUS REIFICATIONS, AND PROOF OF THEIR (OBJECT'S) NON-EXISTENCE

 What sort of (mental) habit holds (things) to be intrinsically
identifiable?
 To describe first of all the pattern (of this mental habit) of the
philosophers; they investigate the meaning of the conventional
expression "person" in such uses as "This person performed this action
and experienced this result," by such (analysis) as "Is the 'person'
the very same thing as 'his' own aggregates?  Or is 'he' something
different from them?"  When they discover whichever possibility,
either sameness or difference, (to be the case), it gives them a
basis for establishing that "person," and they are then able to
establish his accumulation of evolutionary action and so forth.

If they do not find (any such basis), they are unable to establish
(either "person" or his "actions" etc.).
  Hence they cannot rest
content with the mere use of the expression "person.
"  Thus, such
establishment of "person" through analytic investigation into the
referent of the conventional expression "person" is the establishment
of person as having intrinsically identifiable status.
 And all the
Buddhist philosophers, from Analysts to Dogmaticists, hold (their
various types of "persons") in this kind (of pattern).


 Similarly, (this pattern of establishment of intrinsically
identifiable status) holds with regard to all things, either created,
such as forms and sensations etc., or uncreated, inclusive of
the Traditionist (concept of) space established as that absolute
negation which is the mere absence of concrete impenetrability.

(That is,) in establishing the existence of anything believed to
be verified by validating cognition, (these philosophers) cannot do
so if no (intrinsically objective) referent is discovered upon the
investigation into the status of the object which is indicated
by the expression of a particular name, and thus do establish
existence (of something) when the opposite (i.e., ultimate discovery
of objective referent) holds true.  

Finally, the intrinsic identity
(svalakshana) involved in (this sort of) intrinsically
identifiable status is altogether quite different from the
"ultimate particular" (svalakshana) explained precisely
as "functional capacity" in the logicians' treatises, and from
the "defining characteristic" (svalakshana) explained as that
which characterizes (something as) different from everything else,
such as heat in the case of fire, in the Abhidharma Scripture
etc. 

 It is the method of Chandrapada not to accept even conventionally
the presentation of such a sort of existence, his own method of
presenting the conventional (being exemplified) in the Lucid
Exposition:

Moreover, this example is incorrect because the
expressions "pestle" and "Rahu" do exist among mundane conventions,
established without analysis, and do apply to their referents,
body and head (respectively), just as the designations "person"
etc. (exist conventionally and apply non-analytically to conventional
entities, although ultimately there is no such thing as a referent
of "person").


 This statement answers (the argument) that one
can use the conventional expression "Hardness is the intrinsic
identity of earth," although there is no earth that is not hard,
since designation and referent are conceptually appropriate,
just as people employ the conventional expressions "body of a pestle"
and "head of Rahu," although there is nothing more (to a pestle)
than a body, and nothing more (to Rahu) than a head.

 The (gist of) the answer is that it is correct, according to
conventions of social communication, for a speaker to dispel the
doubt of a listener with the expressions "pestle" and "Rahu,"
since the latter has formed the notions of "body" and "head" from
hearing the corresponding words and is wondering "Whose body?"
and "Whose head?".

  Thus, the speaker wishes to eliminate the
possibility of reference to any body other than that of the pestle,
or to any head other than that of Rahu.

  However, this example does
not correspond to the case of the expression "Hardness is the
intrinsic identity of earth," there being no earth which is not
hard, and hence no need to dispel any such doubt.


 (Chandrapada) then goes on to give another reason for the
inappropriateness of the example, explaining that the example
of the two expressions is inapplicable to (a case of essential)
non-difference (expressed verbally by different terms), since
(in fact) the things "body" and "head" and the qualifications
"pestle ('s)" and "Rahu ('s)" prove to be different in terms
of mundane convention.

  (Of course, Chandrakirti is quite aware that)
when one investigates the referents of (these) expressions, they
are not found to be different things, since Rahu's head alone is
called "Rahu," and since the referents of "pestle" and "body," when
sought out, are not to be found apart.

  (Now), it is when (this point)
is brought out as an argument (in favor of the applicability of the
example, that Chandrakirti is impelled to) state (most) succinctly
(his position on the presentation of the conventional).
  Immediately
following the above quotation (of the Lucid Exposition),
(he states):

If you propose that the example is indeed applicable
since (pestle and Rahu) are proved to be nothing different from body
and head, since only those (latter) can be apprehended, I say that
is not so; for, in the usage of social conventions, such a sort of
analysis is not employed (as that seeking essential identity etc.),
and further, the things of the world are (only) existent (insofar)
as unexamined critically.


 Thus, the argument that, although just such a
referent and identity exist for the listener, when the meaning of that
conventional expression is examined, they are not established (even
conventionally) as referent and identity since no "pestle" and "Rahu"
are found apart from the body and the head,--(that argument evinces)
the method of presenting the (conventional) existence of things
of other philosophers explained above.

   And Chandrakirti
answers them, saying that "existence" is a mundane convention, and,
as it cannot be presented through such analysis, it is presented
non-analytically.

 The manner of this non-analytic presentation (is demonstrated)
immediately after the preceding passage:  "Although analytically,
there is no self apart from forms etc., from the social superficial
point of view such (self) has its existence dependent on the
aggregates.

  Thus, as 'Rahu' and 'pestle' are similar in this
respect, your example is not established.
"

 "There is no self" means that there is no analytically discoverable
ground on which to establish "Devadatta," since, when examining the
expressions "Devadatta's body" and "Devadatta's mind" to find the
basis of reference of "Devadatta" and the mode of existence of his
body and mind, no Devadatta is discovered, either as merely his body
and mind or as something apart from them.

  This means that "Devadatta"
is not established by intrinsic identity and not that he does not
exist at all, as he does exist superficially depending on his
aggregates.

  This, he indicates, is the way to understand both
examples.

 As for the manner of establishing things (in general), he continues:
Likewise, analytically it is obvious that there is
no identified (referent) in such things as "earth" apart from such
(identities) as "hardness," and there is no unsupported identity
apart from the identified (referent)--thus, it is just superficial,
and therefore, the Masters (Nagarjuna and Aryadeva) presented
existence in terms of merely mutually dependent status.


 That is to say, in presenting "earth" and "hardness"
as referent and identity, it cannot be done by establishing them as the
discovered object of the above-mentioned analytic quest of the
designative bases of the conventional terms used for identified
referent and identity, as such things can only be presented as existent
in terms of their mutual relationship.

  He then continues to explain
with (further) reasons the necessity to accept his method of presenting
persons and things as the only sure one:
This is necessarily to be accepted in precisely that
way only; otherwise, the superficial would not be the superficial, and
would either lack validity entirely or would become (ultimate) reality.

(Further), not only such things as "pestles" become impossible when
submitted to the logical analyses that will be demonstrated here,
but even (the aggregates) such as "forms," "sensations," etc., have
no existence.  Thus, (according to your understanding of the
superficial) you would have to assent to their utter non-existence
even superficially, just like the "pestle" etc.  As such is not
the case, this (mistaken procedure of presenting the superficial
analytically) is out of the question.

 Having thus declared himself, Chandrakirti concludes
by stating that one must consult the Central Way Introduction
to learn the correct method of presenting the dependently designative
(superficial reality).

   This shows that when conventional
existence is presented as something discovered analytically, it is
so presented by logical processes that inquire into (questions of)
ultimate status, and thus such a thing does not exist superficially,


but exists ultimately.

  By so showing, (it is clear that he equates)
"intrinsically identifiable status" with "ultimate status".

 Here one may object "Why should this be a distinctive feature of
your (Dialecticist system), as the Dogmaticist Centrists also do not
attribute conventional existence to things discovered by philosophical
analysis?  Do they not also refute the presentation of superficial
things as things discovered by rational analysis, as for example
in the Two Realities:  "Since it exists as it appears, analysis
is not applicable:  things are faulted by becoming other (than they
appear to be) when subjected to analysis.
"

 This objection arises from a lack of discernment regarding the
analytic methods of the two types of Centrists, by means of which
they inquire into the question of ultimate status (in things).

The Dialecticist accepts simply the above sort of analysis as
analysis of (something's possession or lack of) ultimate status,
as witnessed by the above quotations and by their frequent
explanations that existents are merely nominal, symbolic, and
conventional.

  "Mere nominality" means, as aforementioned, the
undiscoverability of anything through investigation into the meaning
of conventional expressions, and does not mean that names exist
and things do not, or that there is nothing which is not a name.
(Finally,) although they do not accept everything proposed by the
verbally ascriptive conventional intellect as conventionally
existent, neither do they accept any conventionally existent things
somehow not posited by conventionally ascriptive intellect.

 The Dogmaticist Centrists (on the other hand) believe that forms
and sensations, etc., cannot be presented (as conventionally existent)
on the strength of conventionally ascriptive intellect, but can be
so established on the strength of their appearance in undistorted
sense cognition, etc.  Therefore, there is a great difference
(between the two systems) in regard to the type of cognition involved
in the question of (something's) establishment "on the strength
of cognition.

"  Thus, they believe that the simple analysis of things,
not as established on strength of such (undistorted etc.) cognition,
but as existent or non-existent on strength of their intrinsically
objective condition, serves as the analysis of the question of their
ultimate status, and they do not accept the above (Dialecticist)
analytical method alone (as resolving the question of ultimate status).

Therefore, (it is evident that) they accept intrinsically identifiable
status (as) conventionally (existent).

  And consequently (the two
systems) also differ as to what is excluded by the word "merely"
in the scriptural statements such as "merely nominal"  and "merely
designative."

 We might suppose here, as the mundane person engages in a great deal
of analysis--"Is it happening or not?" or "Is it produced or not?"--
that it must be improper to reply to such inquiries "It happens!"
or "It is produced!"

  However, this mode of inquiry and the above
analytic method are utterly different.

  The mundane person is not
inquiring into coming and going through analysis into the meaning
of the use of the conventional expressions "comer," "goer," "coming,"
and
"going"  out of dissatisfaction with (the fact that they are) merely
conventional usages.

  He is rather making an unreflective

inquiry into the unreflective usage of the expressions "coming" and
"going.
"  

Therefore, how can there be any contradiction between
accepting such investigations (as proper to common parlance and
the acceptance of the undiscoverability of the meaning of conventional
expressions through philosophical analysis).

 Such holding to intrinsically identifiable real existence, arrived
at through analysis of the meaning of conventional expressions, is
not the habit-pattern of unconscious self-habits.

   Yet it is
that (unconscious self-habit) which binds living beings in the
life-cycle, and thus it is that very  (habit-pattern) which
philosophical reasoning must principally refute.  What is the
habit-pattern (of unconscious self-habits)?

 (Unconscious self-habits) hold to the existence of things internal
and external as if they existed in their own right, not merely
established on the strength of convention.

  When such (self-habits)
hold persons such as "Yajna" in such a way, they are (called)
"personal self-habits," and when they hold things such as "eye" and
"ear" in such a way, they are called "objective self-habits.
"  

By
this fact, the two selves also can be understood (as not intrinsically
different but different with reference to the objects involved).


 Although this mental habit does not hold (objects in this way) after
analysis of the meaning of expressions, if the objects thus held (as
objectively real) were to exist in fact, they would have to be
discoverable by the analytic cognition that analyzes the manner of
existence of the referents of conventional expressions.
  
  
  Therefore
since there is no contradiction between the fact that non-analytic,
unconscious self-habits with their objects are the principal
rational negatees and the fact that the treatises contain only
analytic negations (on the theoretical plane), one (should)
not adhere to the notion that "the texts merely negate intellectual
mental habits with their objects.
"

 Although persons whose intelligence is unformed by theories and
living beings bereft of symbolic awareness would not be able
to verbalize "existence of objects (in their own right) not
established on strength of conventionally verbalizing intellect,"
still the meaning (as present in their perceptions) exists for them.

If this were not the case, then even the meaning of the holding
of (the two types of) self would cease to exist (for these beings),
(if it is argued that such mental habits could not exist in beings
who could not verbalize them).


 While the Experientialists and the Dogmaticists assert that the two
selves, which, as negated in persons and things, underlie the two
selflessnesses, along with the ways they are conceptualized, are
quite different objects, this system distinguishes selflessnesses
with respect to their bases of reference, but does not assert
a difference in "selves" which are actually non-existent.

 In the Central Way Introduction, in the following:  "This
selflessness was proclaimed to be of two types, on account of the
division between persons and things, in order to liberate living
beings".

  (Chandrakirti) states the distinction (as made)
according to the distinction between persons and things and does
not state it as made from the point of view of (any sort of) two
selves.

  Furthermore, in the Four Hundred Commentary, he
explains:  

"As for 'self,' it is a reality or substance of things
that does not relate to anything else.  

As it does not exist, there is selflessness.

  That again is understood as twofold because
of the distinction between persons and things; 

namely personal
selflessness and objective selflessness".
  Here, an
"unrelated reality" is an independent reality, which would be
existence with the mode of being of an objective entity, not
merely as a nominal designation.

 Here one might suppose that if (we maintain that) all Buddhist
schools from Analysts to Dogmaticists believe things admittedly
established by validating cognition to have intrinsically
identifiable status,
 then we contradict (our) previous
explanation of the Experientialists' rejection of intrinsic identity
and postulation of verbal and conventional status in regard to the
admitted existence of the imagined (nature of reality), as
constituted by ascriptive and descriptive designation.


(However,) we are not liable to this fault, for, granted that they
do state that what can be established by ascriptive and descriptive
designation is "not established by its intrinsic identity," they
do not admit (such non-establishment as equivalent to) the quest
and non-discovery of a designative base to which (something's) name
is assigned.

   Therefore they do hold to intrinsically
identifiable
status as explained in this (Dialecticist system).
  Although their
treatises explain the ascriptively and descriptively designated
as "merely verbal," they interpret "mere verbal designation" as
(meaning) that there is no real object as apparent to the perception
of the dualistic cognition of disparate subject and object.
  This
differs from the (meaning of) "mere verbal designation" in this system.

##### MEANING OF STATEMENT OF TWOFOLD SELFLESSNESS, EVEN IN THE INDIVIDUAL VEHICLE

The Experientialists and the Dogmaticists believe that the
Individual Vehicle Canon does not teach objective selflessness,
but teaches only personal selflessness, which (latter) therefore
needs no further explanation in the Universal Vehicle, having been
determined in the Individual Vehicle.  However, the system of the
two masters rejects both of these ideas.

 First, in regard to the way in which the Individual Vehicle Canon
teaches objective selflessness, Buddhapalita states:
As examples of the selflessness of created things,
the Lord used "illusion," "echo," "reflection," "hallucination,"
"dream," "ball of foam," "bubble," and "plantain trunk.
"  He also
stated things to have no actuality, no reliable reality, but to
be mental fabrications and false.  When He stated "all things are
selfless,"  He meant they were without reality, the word "self"
meaning "intrinsic reality.
"

 He explains that since the Individual Vehicle
Canon contains the use of the metaphors "foam," "bubble," "reed,"
"hallucination," and "illusion," for the five aggregates, respectively,
and also the statements "All these are false," and "All things are
selfless," it does teach the unreality of all things, "self" meaning
"intrinsic reality.
"
 (Chandrakirti) states, in the Introduction Commentary, that the
Individual Vehicle teaches objective selflessness, and he cites
quotations from Individual Vehicle Scriptures such as "Form is like
a ball of foam.
"

  He explains, in the Philosophical Sixty
Commentary, that (Nagarjuna) does not give the reasonings to
reject nihilism, as these are explicit in the Individual Vehicle,
but does give the reasonings to reject absolutism, because, although
(the Individual Vehicle contains) statements such as "There is only
one holy truth, and that is Nirvana, whose nature is non-deceptive,"
and "All created things are false, and their nature is deceptive,"
these statements are not frequent, uninterrupted, and set forth in
a continuous exposition.


 In this context, Bhavaviveka rejects (Buddhapalita's interpretation),
saying that "these examples demonstrate that the apparent personal
self does not exist, and hence teach personal selflessness, not
objective selflessness.

  The meaning of the word "self" is not the
"intrinsic reality of things," but is the "self of a person.
"  If the
Individual Vehicle taught objective selflessness, the Universal
Vehicle would be pointless.
"

 (In response, Chandrakirti in the Introduction Commentary)
supports (Buddhapalita), giving evidence from the Jewel Garland,
and declaring that "(Buddha) does not only teach objective selflessness
in the Universal Vehicle, but also teaches the stages, the
transcendences, the vows, and the two stores etc., and therefore
(the Universal Vehicle) is not pointless.
"

 Chandrakirti further proves that such is the position of the Master
(Nagarjuna), quoting the Wisdom:


The Lord knew things and their non-existence,

Hence, in the Advice to Katyayana,

He accomplished the negation

Of both existence and non-existence.

The Lord declared as "falsehood"

Everything that is deceptive.

All created things are deceptive,

Therefore, they are false.

He also quotes the Philosophical Sixty:

When the Victors declare

That Nirvana is the sole truth,

What intelligent person would then presume

That other things were not rejected?

Thus as (Chandrakirti) proves definitively from
the Wisdom that the meaning of "falsehood" is "unreality which
is emptiness with respect to intrinsic reality," and faults any
other interpretation, it must definitely be accepted that the
thought of the Holy (Masters) is that even the Individual Vehicle
Canon expounds objective selflessness.

  Nevertheless, this does not
(seek to) establish that there are no statements in the Individual
Vehicle Canon to the effect that "there is a reality in things
which is established by intrinsic identity," as such
statements do occur there frequently.

 In regard to personal selflessness (generally), according to all
Individual Vehicle and Universal Vehicle philosophers, it is
postulated as merely the non-existence of a substantial,
self-sufficient person, distinct in nature from the aggregates.

As for the pattern (of belief in such a person), the self that is
the basis of the notion "I" is held to resemble the master of the
aggregates and the aggregates are held to resemble its servants,
since the "I" is held to control them, and they to belong to it,
as expressed in such notions as "my forms"  and "my sensations.
"

 Thus, when (such a self) appears self-sufficient and distinct in
nature from the aggregates, like master and slaves, and it is assumed
to exist in reality, then that is the habitual adherence to its
substantial existence.  When that (type of self) is negated, the
person (is admitted by these philosophers) as a "mere designation"
upon the aggregates, the (word) "mere" ruling out the existence of
the self as something other than the aggregates.

 In regard to the method of designation, Bhavaviveka in the Blaze
of Arguments states that "Thus, conventionally we designate
consciousness with the word 'self' because (thereby) the conglomerate
of body and faculties is designated according to the scriptural
statement, 'Consciousness is the self, because it takes rebirth'.
"

Thus, he cites the scriptural statement that the aggregates are
designated as a "living being," just as an assembly of pieces is
designated a "chariot.
"  

He continues to make his case, with
statements from certain Scriptures in which the mind is called
the "self," such as "If the mind is controlled, happiness will be
attained," and "When the self is controlled, heaven will be obtained,"
and with reasonings such as "The self appropriates the aggregates,
and consciousness takes rebirth; therefore consciousness is
established as the self.
"

 This master does not assert any fundamental consciousness, hence
(for him) the consciousness that appropriates the body is the
mental consciousness, and other (philosophers) who do not admit
a fundamental consciousness are in agreement.
  Those who assert
a fundamental consciousness, assert its actual continuum as the
person.
  As for the scriptural references which these
(philosophers use to support) their assertions about the personal
self, they are too numerous to mention.

 According to Chandrakirti's system, although (these philosophers)
do negate the substantial existence of such a (self-sufficient)
person, they do not (thereby) negate the intrinsically identifiable
status of the person, and thus do not (accept it) as merely
a conventional designation.

  Hence, since their holding to its
(intrinsically identifiable) existence is tantamount to adhering
to the person as true, it is (still) the personal self-habit,
just as (holding things as true) is the objective self-habit.

 Above all, he explains that the direct realization and subsequent
meditation upon the non-existence of that self-sufficient, substantial
self, which is (also) the very object the heterodox hold as the real,
internal agent, a "soul" construed as different from the aggregates,
do not reduce in the slightest the habitual reality-notion (explained)
above in regard to forms etc.  

Thus (such meditations do) not apply
to the elimination of addictions such as desire which arise from
the notion of the reality of the aggregates.

 Thus, he states, in the Central Way Introduction:

When you understand selflessness through your yoga (method,)

You do not realize the (ultimate) reality of forms etc.

Greed, therefore, initiated on perception of form,

Will (still) arise, since you have not realized

the (ultimate) nature of those (objects).


and in the Philosophical Sixty Commentary:

It is completely impossible to eliminate addictions
for those who, although they want to do so, still perceive an
intrinsic reality in forms etc.  To show this, (Nagarjuna) declared:
"What could stop the great poison of addictions in those whose
minds have the place?  Even when they are in (an indifferent)
state, they will be seized by the snake of addictions.
" 


Here, "place" means the object which gives rise
to truth-habits, (namely), a (supposed) intrinsically identifiable
status (in things).

 As for (the previous) method of others to present the person as
designatively existent, it is not (corroborated by) the meaning
of this statement in the Individual Vehicle Canon:  "Just as
'chariot' designates the assembly of its parts, so superficially
'living beings' designates the aggregates"; because (if they did
accept this meaning, they would know that) just as the "chariot"
ascribed to the parts cannot properly be a part, so the "person"
designated as ascribed to the aggregates cannot properly be an
aggregate.

 It might be supposed, nevertheless, that since "chariot" is
ascribed to the assemblage of the parts, the chariot thus being
precisely the assemblage itself, it is (the same) also with the
aggregates (and the "person").

 (However,) the very fact that something is an ascriptive designation
necessarily rules it out as being (itself) the referent designated,
just as (events) caused by the elements are designated as "blue"
and "eye" etc., (yet those elements and events are not merely
the words "blue" and "eye" etc.).
  And, as such (designations)
as "pot" are similar (in this respect) to the "self," there need
be no uncertainty in regard to them (either).

 (Chandrakirti) states this point in the Introduction:  "The
Scripture states that it is ascribed to the aggregates; therefore,
the 'self' is not the mere conglomerate of the parts.
"

 Again, it might be supposed, from the scriptural statement, "When
the ascetics and priests think 'the self,' they are looking only at
these five aggregates," that these (five aggregates) are the self,
as they are mentioned there as the object of the view of self.

However, (such statements) do not teach the aggregates as being
the object of the view of self by way of positive proof, but rather
the word "only" refutes the existence of any object of the view
of self other than the aggregates.
  This is confirmed in other
Scriptures, where statements such as "form is not the self"
refute the possibility of each one of the aggregates being the
self.

  As (Chandrakirti) expresses it in the Introduction:

If the aggregates are admitted as self

because of statements

By the Teacher -- "The aggregates are the self!"

(It is a mistake).


He (merely) negates the self as other

than the aggregates,

As proven by other scriptural statements--
.
"Form is not self" etc.

This statement also gives insight into the verbal
meaning of the expression "futile view.
"

 These (reasonings above) acknowledge the conventional existence
of the objective object of unconscious "I"-habits, which have
two kinds of objects, objective and aspective.  The aspective
object is the intrinsically identifiable status of the self,
as held in the thought "That self exists by its intrinsic reality,"
and does not in fact exist, even conventionally.

  (Similarly,)
the (objective) object of unconscious futile views, which are
(forms of) possessiveness, is (the designation) "mine."  And the
aspective (object) is held to be the intrinsically identifiable
status of "mine."

 Here the objection may be raised that, if the aggregates are not
properly the object of unconscious self-habits, the scriptural
negations (such as) "forms etc. are not the self" are inappropriate,
because those (aggregates mentioned) are not properly the object
or basis of the unconscious futile views which hold (those
aggregates) as the self.

 This criticism does not apply, since both the mental habits holding
self and aggregates as the same and the mental habits holding self
and aggregates as different are intellectual mental habits and not
unconscious (mental habits).

  Yet still, if there were (an object)
as supposed by the unconscious futile views, it would not exist
in any other way than as either the same or different (from the
aggregates), and therefore negating (those possibilities) through
such analysis would still be appropriate.

 The foregoing has demonstrated that scriptural authority supports
(this position) and does not fault it.

  (To give proof by)
reasoning, it is not reasonable for the consciousness or any other
aggregate to be the self, since the aggregates are appropriated
by the self, and the self is the appropriator of the aggregates;
otherwise, agent and action would become the same.
 This very (argument) is the intention of the Holy (Masters), as
witnessed by the statements from the Wisdom:  "If firewood
were the fire, then agent and action would be the same"; 

and
"By (the example of) wood and fire, all processes of the self and
appropriation, together with (notions) such as 'pots' and 'wool,'
are completely explained.
"

 Furthermore, (Nagarjuna) states, in the Wisdom:  "Appropriation
should be understood as similar".

  Just as action and agent
exist designatively dependent on each other and have no intrinsically
real status, so should the appropriated and the appropriator be
represented.

 (For example,) one can easily employ the expression "Yajna sees"
based on (his) eye's seeing of forms, and one can easily employ
the expression "his eye sees forms" based on Yajna's looking at
forms, and yet this will not be contradicted by the facts that
(in the first case) the eye that sees the forms is not Yajna,
and (in the second case) that the Yajna who looks at forms
is not an eye.  Likewise, while it is admitted that one can use
conventional expressions such as either "I was sick and am cured"
or even "my eye was sick and is cured" when one's eye is sick
and is cured, nevertheless, social conventions do not establish
the actual eye itself as both the self and the property of the self.

By this example, one should understand the remainder of the
experiential media, internal and external, in relation
to the self; that is, depending on one of them the other is
represented as "hearer" (of sound) etc.

 Now the heterodox (scholars), perceiving that it is inappropriate
to posit such things as eye etc.#as the person, posit a "person"
who is a seer etc. and is substantially different from those (things
such as eye).

  And other orthodox Buddhist scholars, perceiving the
flaws in (the postulate of) substantial difference, posit
consciousness or some other function of the aggregates as the
person.

  (But) those who understand the teachings of the Victor
as being unmistaken are liberated by the realization that there is
no reality (in things) other than that which is merely designated
conventionally.

  This is declared in the Introduction Commentary.

  (A caution here is that) one must know how to represent
properly the accumulation of evolutionary action and the experience
of effects in the light of the fact of the mere designativeness
(of things).

 Therefore, since (Chandrakirti), according to his determination
in the Introduction and its Commentary of the intended meaning
of scriptural statements such as "just as 'chariot' designates,
etc.," understands personal selflessness as the lack of intrinsic
reality (of person), tantamount to the undiscoverability of the
referent of the conventional expression "person," having sought it
in seven ways, his explanation is utterly distinctive from others.

And the substance of the intention of the Buddhapalita Commentary
is the same.


##### 2. ON THAT BASIS, THE DISTINCTIVENESS OF THEIR  METHOD TO ELUCIDATE THE HOLY INTENTION


##### A. DISTINCTIVENESS IN (INTERPRETATION OF) THE REALIZATION OF SELFLESSNESS, THE GROSS AND SUBTLE SELF-HABITS, etc.

The unexcelled distinction of Buddhapalita and Chandrakirti's
elucidations of the intention of the Holy Father and Son, setting them
apart from other elucidations, is their representation of the two
realities, wherein all the structures of the life-cycle and of
Nirvana are perfectly viable.  (Thus, they) establish the existence
(of things) on the strength of convention without (their) having
any reality not established on the strength of convention.

  (And
this reconciles the facts that) investigation of the referents
of conventional expressions for "persons" and "things" discovers
nothing at all either the same or different etc., and yet conventional
expressions such as "Yajna" and "eye" are definitely to be employed.

 (The fact that) "conventional existence" and "conventional production"
etc. mean (that the existent is) established as such on the strength
of convention (is corroborated in the following) statements, first
from the Dharma Digest:

Worthy son!  Being in the world consists of habitual
adherence to (the notions of) production and cessation, and thus
the Tathagata, with his great compassion, in order to avoid
generating terror in people, declares that "(things) are produced
and ceased" on the strength of conventions.

  However, worthy son,
here, nothing at all is produced;

and from the Emptiness Seventy:

The Buddhas declare (that things) "are," "are
produced," "are destroyed," "exist," "do not exist," "are inferior,"
"mediocre," or "superior," on the strength of social conventions,
and not on the strength of reality.

 Furthermore, the Mother Scripture etc. state
that "(things) exist as mundane conventions.
"
  
  Therefore, the
Centrist must represent (existence) as conventional.

  However, although
mundane convention does employ formulations such as "the sprout is
produced from the seed," they are employed only without investigation
into the referent of the conventional expressions through analysis
as to whether it is produced from itself or from something else etc.
(This is) because the Holy Masters explained (conventional expressions)
in just that way.

  It is also because, this system's presentation
of the meaning of unanalyzed, mundane conventional expressions being
apparent from the above explanation of (its) interpretation of
"person," the ascription of "person" to something substantially
different from the aggregates and so on is definitely inappropriate
as the meaning of mundane conventional expressions.

  For, in the
world, the self and its possessions are represented as master and
slaves.

 It being thus necessary to understand in accordance with this
explanation that such is the rule of the ultimate existence and
non-existence of persons and things, and that (hence) also such is
the (rule of) twofold selflessness, there is no way to arrive at
the realization of personal selflessness while still asserting
philosophically the existence of an objective self.

  (This is
supported in) the Introduction Commentary where it is said
that without destroying the mental habit of an objective self,
personal selflessness is not realized.


 This is the superior position of the Holy Masters.

  In the
Philosophical Sixty, (Nagarjuna), saying:  

"There is no
liberation through 'existence,' nor will non-existence take one
beyond this world--the Great Ones are delivered by thorough
knowledge of both reality and unreality,"
  states that there
is no liberation as long as both absolutism, which holds things
as having intrinsically identifiable existence, and nihilism,
which sees cause and effect as impossible, are not destroyed,
and that there is liberation when the actuality of reality and
unreality is known, free from the two extremes.

  "Liberation"
here is not properly interpreted as meaning (liberation) from
objective obscurations, as (Chandrakirti's commentary) specifies
(it to be liberation) from this cyclic existence.

 Similarly, (Nagarjuna) saying in the Jewel Garland:  
 
 "Thus,
it is delusory to hold this mirage-like world to 'exist' or
'not to exist'; and the deluded are not liberated.

  The absolutist
goes to heaven, the nihilist to bad migrations.

  But one who does
not rely on duality, knowing reality accurately, does become free,"

  declares that the avoidance of the two extremes of being and
nothingness is necessary for liberation from cyclic life.

 Thus, when teaching objective selflessness as the negation of
subject-object substantial dichotomy, the Universal Vehicle
teaches a gross and a subtle (form of that) objective selflessness,
the (first) failing to negate intrinsic reality in the (remaining)
cognition devoid of duality, and (the latter) negating intrinsic
reality in that (cognition) as well.

  And just as we take only the
latter as definitive in meaning, so, with the Disciple Canon's
teaching of a gross and a subtle personal selflessness, we should
accept the subtle selflessness as definitive in meaning, since the
reasons are the same in all respects.


 This being the case, the (Dialecticist) method of equating the
self-habits with the two obscurations
 is also different.

Whereas the other Centrists understand objective self-habits
as objective obscurations, this system takes them to be addictive
(obscurations).

  Thus Buddhapalita (explained) how (Nagarjuna)
wrote the Wisdom, having seen the danger for living beings in the
variety of sufferings, to teach them the true reality of things
in order to liberate them.

  He further explained how, although
"reality" means "lack of intrinsic reality," the eye of intelligence
(of living beings) is obscured by the darkness of delusion, and they
think there is an intrinsic reality in things, whereby their
attraction and aversion (for these things) arises.

  (Finally, he
explained) how the illumination from knowledge of relativity
clears up the darkness of delusion, the intrinsic unreality of
things is seen, and attraction and aversion do not arise, thus
deprived of any ground.

  To corroborate (his statement) he cites
(Aryadeva's) Four Hundred:  

"The seed of existence is consciousness, 

and objects are its sphere of activity.

  When the
objects are seen to be selfless, 

the seed of existence will be
stopped".

 Thus, "delusion," grouped with desire and hatred (as one of the
three major addictions), is explained as consisting of truth-habits
about things and as the seed of existence, and it is further stated
that its abandonment requires the realization of selflessness,
which itself is the realization of the intrinsic unreality of things.

Therefore, (Buddhapalita) believes the actual holding to the truth
of personal and objective things to be addictive misknowledge.
 (Chandrakirti also) clearly explains the holding of things as truths
to be addictive misknowledge, the first of the twelve links (of
dependent origination), in his Four Hundred Commentary:


"Consciousness, attached to things under the influence of addictive
misknowledge which causes excessive reification of intrinsic reality
in things, is the seed of the cyclic process.

  And, when it entirely
ceases, it is established that the life-cycle ceases;"

  and
in his Introduction Commentary:

Misknowledge, whose nature is the obscuration
of the understanding of the real nature (of things) and the
reification (of reality) in things without intrinsic reality, is
utterly false...

Thus, the superficial truth is established
under the influence
of the addictive misknowledge included among the (twelve)
factors of existence.

 Both personal and objective self-habits are present
in this unconscious misknowledge, and hence the personal self-habit
also is addictive misknowledge.  

For this reason, there is no
contradiction involved in the fact that sometimes misknowledge,
and sometimes unconscious futile views, are said to be the root
of cyclic existence.  Now the objective of such unconscious self-habits
is the basis of the "I"-habit, hence the mental habit holding other
persons to have intrinsically identifiable status is not (among)
the futile views, although it is a personal self-habit.

 This interpretation is the superior position of the Holy Father and
Son, as (Nagarjuna), saying in the Emptiness Seventy:  

"The
Teacher proclaimed that misknowledge is the consideration that
things arisen from causes and conditions are real, and from that
the twelve factors arise,"
 declares further that terminating
misknowledge with the realization of things' emptiness of intrinsic
reality terminates all twelve factors (of dependent origination).

 (Aryadeva also) states that the realization of relativity is necessary
for the termination of the misknowledge included in the three poisons,
as in the Four Hundred:  

"Delusion gets into everything, 

just as the physical sense does in the body; 

hence by conquering delusion,

all addictions are also conquered.

When relativity is realized (in things), 

delusion does not arise; 

hence all our efforts herein are only to explain that message."


  The meaning of "relativity" (here) is repeatedly stated in this system to be "emptiness of
intrinsic reality.
"

 Therefore, all the reasonings of the central way are factors of
the eradication of the habit-pattern of misknowledge, the root of
the life-cycle.  Hence, having identified how our own unconscious
misknowledge maintains its hold, we should strive to terminate it,
and should not amuse ourselves with expertise in mere hair-splitting
with other philosophers!

 One might well wonder, if indeed unconscious personal self-habits
and unconscious objective self-habits are without difference in
habit-pattern, what about all those explanations of the Dogmaticists?

 The notion of the existence of a self-sufficient, substantial person,
distinct in nature from the aggregates, holds the person to be
substantially different from such things as feet and hands etc., and
hence is not present in those whose minds are uninfluenced by
theories.

(Chandrakirti) states this in the Central Way Introduction:
"When an ordinary man plants a mere seed, he says 'I made this
son!' or 'I have planted a tree!'; hence there is no production
from other (things) even in social conventions.
"

 And Buddhapalita also states:  "(The ordinary person) when he
plants a seed of a tree and it grows, points to the tree and
employs the expression 'I planted this tree!'"

 Hence he does not hold the (seed and the tree) to be substantially
different.

  If the contrary were true, (i.e., if it were
conventionally ordinary to think of substantially different things
producing each other), the absurd consequence would be that when
a (juniper) tree grows, one could employ the expression "I planted
a myrobalan tree!"

 If we apply this reasoning, we must say (with Chandrakirti in the
Introduction):  

"When an ordinary person hurts his hand, 

he says
and thinks 'I am hurt!'; 

hence there is no substantial difference

between the two in (the conventions of) the world.
"

 Such things as these are not only expressed by ordinary people,
but are also accepted necessarily in such a manner.

  If we could
not establish that the tree is planted and the person is hurt
because of (the apparently objective) fact that the planted seed
is not a tree and the hurt hand is not a person, then such
(expressions and considerations) would be impossible, and the whole
(conventional) order would be demolished.

  The essence of these (above)
reasonings dictates that we interpret as intellectual the objective
self-habits explained as unconscious by the Dogmaticist
philosophers.

 Such being the case, one wonders what to do with objective
obscurations.

  There is no clearer identification (of objective
obscurations) in the indisputable treatises of the Father and Son
or in the whole Dialecticist literature than (the following)
identification (of Chandrakirti's) in the Introduction Commentary:
The instinct for misknowledge is the hindrance
to complete comprehension of knowable things.

  It also exists
as the instinct for desire etc., and is the cause of such types
of functions of body and speech.

  Further, that instinctual
propensity for misknowledge, desire, etc., is only eliminated
in (attainment of) Buddhahood or omniscience, and not in any other
(persons or stages).


 "Such functions of body and speech" belong to
the Saints, who exhibit the unfortunate propensities of body and
speech called "jumping monkey-like" and "contemptuous toward
others," which propensities have been eliminated by the Teacher,
yet are not eliminated by them.

   "Also" points out that the
instinct for desire etc.#is also a hindrance to the full
comprehension of knowables.

  Hence, the instincts of all addictions
constitute the objective obscurations, and all factors of the error
of dualism, their effect, are included within those (objective
obscurations).

 (Chandrakirti defines) "instinct" itself as "that which defiles,
infects, and goes along with the mental process, its synonyms
being 'lower limit of addictions,' 'habituation,' and 'root'".

 Although there is no other way to abandon these objective
obscurations than the above-explained path of realizing the ultimate
reality, the difference of the abandonments in the Individual Vehicle
and in the Universal Vehicle arises from the (various) degrees of
completeness of the factors of the method and from the duration
of the time of familiarity (with the method).

 The above indications enable us to understand the differences as to
interpretability and definitiveness between the various methods of
liberation from the various obscurations, through the realization
of the selflessnesses in the various forms of the two self-habits.

And the key points (are found in) the many different scriptural
statements which identify the two self-habits and (explain) the
gross and subtle forms of the two selflessnesses.

 Since the interpretation, condition, and actuality of the instincts
are difficult questions when one does not accept any fundamental
consciousness, I should explain them here; but I will not undertake
this since the matter cannot be settled briefly, and I hesitate
to digress too much.


 Finally, these distinctive specialities (of the Dialecticist system),
different from other philosophical systems, have arisen regarding
the questions about whether or not (the two selflessnesses) are
understood by the (various practitioners of) the Universal Vehicle
and the Individual Vehicle, about the two self-habits, and about
the two obscurations, for the reason that the interpretations of
the truth-habits regarding persons and things are different, and
hence the selflessnesses of both (persons and things) are also
different.

##### B. DISTINCTIVE SPECIALTY OF ALLOWING THE EXTERNAL OBJECTIVE WITHOUT ALLOWING APPERCEPTIVE CONSCIOUSNESS AND FUNDAMENTAL CONSCIOUSNESS

 Since such is the way of representation of persons and things,
it is not possible to make distinctions such as "conventionally,
'persons' such as 'stream-winners' exist, but 'persons' such as
'hell-denizens' do not," because they are similar insofar as they are
equally non-existent ultimately and equally existent conventionally.

Likewise, among things (categorized as) aggregates, elements, and
media, it is not possible to make a distinction such as that "corporeal
things do not exist, but mind and mental functions do," because they
are equally existent or equally non-existent in terms of (either
of the) two realities.



 All the postulates of those other Centrists who claim equal existence
of the external objective and the internal subjective, and of
certain Centrists and Idealists who claim that the subjective
exists and not the objective, amount to no more than the claim that,
for something to exist, it must have intrinsically identifiable status,
and that, if something has no such intrinsic identity, it cannot exist.

This system also accepts the impossibility of the intrinsically
identifiable status of the external objective (world), but disagrees
over the question of a (consequent) necessity for the (utter)
non-existence of the external objective.  Therefore, if one understands
in general how to represent the existence of anything whatsoever, in
spite of its lack of intrinsic identifiability, one is well able to
understand the reasonings for the impossibility of differentiating
the existence and non-existence (in terms of the same reality) of
the objective and the subjective.  (Conversely,) without that
(general understanding), one cannot understand (those reasonings).

 Therefore, (Chandrakirti) states in the Four Hundred Commentary
that reasonings such as "there is no objective (realm), because
neither gross nor subtle (forms) of matter exist, because the
negation of indivisible atoms also negates gross (substances) which
are their aggregates," can negate the indivisibility of objective
(things), but cannot negate the very existence of objective (things),
since (such a conclusion) is faulted both by scriptural authority
and by common sense.

 In regard to (interpretation of scriptural references germane to
the status of the external objective), according to Bhavaviveka,
the meaning of the Ten Stages statement that "the three realms
are merely mind" is not that the word "merely" negates those
(external objects), but clearly that it negates any sort of
world-creator other than the mind, (and Chandrakirti agrees with
this interpretation).

  (However), Chandra does not accept
Bhavaviveka's explanation that the (Mission to Lanka) statements
such as "the externally apparent does not exist" do not negate
external objects.

  (Chandra) rather explains that, although the
Scripture does teach that (negation of the external), it is
interpretable in meaning.

  Thus, he refutes (the Experientialist use
of these references) by saying, in the case of the Ten Stages,
not that the Scripture is interpretable in meaning, but that (negation
of the external) is not the Scripture's meaning; and by saying,
in the case of this Mission to Lanka reference, not that
(negation of the external) is not the Scripture's meaning, but that
the reference is interpretable in meaning.

  (Chandra's) intention
is that one should accept as taught both the Mother Scripture's
instruction that the five aggregates are all indiscriminately empty
with respect to intrinsic reality and the Abhidharmic explanations
that all five equally have their particular and universal natures;
because the objective and the subjective are similar in that the
analysis of the mode of existence of the referents of verbal
designations (of such things) discovers no (substantial referents),
and yet as both are posited as superficially existent on strength
of verbal conventions, there is no difference (between the
objective and the subjective superficially either).

  Therefore, such
discriminations (between the objective and the subjective) in regard
to their existence and non-existence contravene the conventions
of common parlance as well as the representations of the ultimate,
and hence are wrong about both realities.

  As (Aryadeva) says, in the Four Hundred:

(In regard to subject and object) to say

"The one exists, yet the other does not!"

Is not proper ultimately, nor conventionally.

Thus, one cannot even use the expression.

Thus, this is also the intention of the Holy (Nagarjuna).

 As for the meaning of such statements as:  "Such (things) as the
so-called (four) elements are really included in consciousness,"

(it is that) forms, minds, mental functions, and anomalous creations
are designated as elements, etc., according to their representation
in the consciousness that perceives them; because if they were not
so represented, they could not be represented as separately existent.

Thus, those things such as elements are included in the category
of consciousness, being merely its representations.

  And therefore,
such an (authoritative) reference is not a negation of external
objects, its meaning being as (above and as) elucidated in its own
commentary.

  Thus, when the creative purity of consciousness is
directly known as unproduced with respect to its intrinsic reality,
then also the variety of objects it represents (will be known) as
free (of intrinsic reality) and (their apparent objectivity will)
decline, just as a (mirror-) image terminates when the (original)
form terminates.

 Nor does the non-acceptance of the fundamental consciousness
fault (this position).

  For, the fundamental consciousness is (only)
asserted to (serve) as a basis of effects of evolutionary actions,
(especially) the development of evolutionary effects of actions
arising after a long time, since actions are terminated in their own
second moment, and there is (supposedly) no effect arising from a
terminated thing.

  And hence, when one can represent phenomena even
without intrinsic identifiability, a (posited) fundamental
consciousness is no longer necessary, since a terminated thing
is perfectly admissible as a phenomenon.

  As (Chandra states) in the Introduction:

Since things are not really ceased intrinsically,

This is possible without a fundamental;

Understand how evolutionary effects can arise sometimes

Even long after evolutionary actions have ceased!

Not only is it easy to abandon absolutistic
and nihilistic views in regard to both realities when one knows
how to represent a realityless causality by rejecting intrinsic
identifiability even superficially, but also the coherence of the
evolutionary effects of actions is viable even without admitting
any fundamental consciousness.

  As Chandra states in the Introduction Commentary:

Therefore, not only does intrinsic realitylessness
(enable one) to abandon utterly absolutism and nihilism with regard
to both realities, but also the coherence of the effects of actions,
even when the actions are long terminated, is viable without imagining
any such things as the continuity, retentiveness, and possession of
a fundamental consciousness.


 "Therefore" refers to his previous explanation of
how one intrinsically realityless thing produces other intrinsically
realityless things.

   Although it is necessary, upon denying
fundamental consciousness, to rebut other criticisms such as the
charge of the incompatibility of the final mind in death with the
initial mind in (the subsequent) birth, Chandra does not explain
them, thinking that knowing this (above) rule enables one to know
the others.

  And I will not digress to explain them here, fearing
prolixity.


 (Finally), the key point in not positing the fundamental consciousness
is the acceptance of external objects, for if one does assert (the
existence of external objects) one must agree with the statement
of the Center and Extremes:

(One may say) "Consciousness arises, 

seeing Things, beings, selves, and ideas,

(But) those objects do not exist (in fact);"

(And) if they don't exist, neither does it!

(Chandrakirti) explains the method of proving that
a terminated thing is a phenomenon in his Lucid Exposition and
in his Philosophical Sixty Commentary, and I intend to explain
it in my super-commentary on the Wisdom.

  (Finally), the
representation of the three times (past, present, and future),
through the key point of admitting a terminated thing as a
phenomenon, is a major distinctive specialty (of this system).


 (Chandrakirti) states the position of his antagonist who asserts
apperception and the refutation (of that position) in the
Introduction Commentary, (along the following lines):  

"Memory
is impossible without prior experience, hence memory is produced
from experience.  

There is memory of the prior object-- 'Such
was seen' --and of the prior subject-- 'I saw'.

Hence, there is
experience of such (subjective prior states) as the cognition of
blue.  Further, if that (cognition) was experienced by some
different cognition, that (second cognition) would have to be
experienced by still another, which would entail (the fault) of
infinite regress.

  Or, if the prior cognition were to be
experienced by a later cognition, that later cognition would not
encompass other objects such as form.

  Hence, a (cognition) must
experience itself, as it is certain that there are only the two
(possibilities of simultaneity or successiveness) in experience.
Therefore, subsequent memory establishes that the prior experience
of a past object includes an apperceptive consciousness.
"

 (Chandra answers:) "If this proof is made in terms of substantially
existent (mental states etc.), then, as there is no such
(substantially existent) memory, your (reason is) as (difficult)
to prove as your probandum.

  Or, if (the proof)  is in conventional
terms, as that (apperception) is not established for your
antagonist as the cause of memory (even conventionally), your proof
of the existence of apperceptive consciousness by the existence
of memory is like proving the existence of water-crystal and
fire-crystal by the existence of water and fire."

 As this antagonist's (syllogism) is (an inference) reasoning
from an effect, (Chandra) takes it in terms of its holding
apperception as the probandum.

  That being done, an example is
not found, since even if (this antagonist) were to propose, "There
is an experiencer of blue-cognition, because of the existence of a
subsequent memory;  just as (in the case of) blue (which is perceived
and subsequently remembered)," although there is a mere conformity
to the reason and probandum in the example, invariable concomitance
between them cannot be established.

  Hence, the example is not
mentioned explicitly, like the fact that apperceptive consciousness
is the probandum.

  And, although (such a syllogism) might prove
the (existence of) mere experience, as that would be (proving the)
already proven, it is not (formally) proposed, like that (fact
that apperception is the probandum).

 According to (Chandrakirti's) system, the non-existence of
apperceptive consciousness does not preclude the production of
memory, as he shows in the Introduction:

As I have no (intrinsically) other memory

From that (cognition) experiencing objects,

I will remember "I saw (it)!" --

This is the system of social conventions.


This verse does not refute the above-explained reason
for holding that the production of memory is excluded by the absence
of apperceptive consciousness.

  It (merely) refutes the notion of
apperceptive consciousness above, which depends (logically) on a
special sort of (intrinsically other) memory (for whose production
it is necessary).

  The notion is that, since when one remembers a
prior seeing of blue, as "I saw it before," one is remembering
that former seeing as seen by oneself, that (special) sort of memory
would be precluded if the former blue-cognition did not experience
itself, and thus that former (cognition) was self-consciously
apperceptive.

 (However), (Chandrakirti) proves that the notion "I saw it before"
occurs not by the influence of apperceptive consciousness, but by
the influence of the application of both the prior experience of
the blue object and the later memory-cognition to one (and the same)
object.

  And further, in order to prove that, he argues that since
the (same) object which is first experienced and discerned by the
prior cognition of blue is remembered by the later blue-cognition,
it is not not experienced and not not discerned.

  As he states:

"according to me it is because experience and memory are not
intrinsically identifiably other".  If merely that reason (of
identifiable otherness) were (enough to establish apperception),
then Maitreya's experience would be remembered by Upagupta.

Therefore, if those two (memory and experience) were established
as substantially different, as the antagonist would have it,
the natural (conventional) mind would hold notions of (their)
substantial otherness, it would not hold that what was perceived
by the blue-cognition is perceived (also) by the later memory,
it would be impossible for experience and memory to have the same
object, and it would be impossible for the memory "I saw it before"
to occur.

  But according to us, those two are not substantially
different and the natural mind has no such notions, and hence (we can)
show that it is not impossible for memory to hold "I discerned it"
about an object discerned by a previous cognition.

  Furthermore,
(memory) accedes to an object by force of the attraction of a prior
experience, being without any independent motivation to discern any
object, as is not the case with any other (hypothetical independent
cognition, such as the second instant of blue-cognition etc.).

 Thus, this non-acceptance of apperceptive consciousness, even
conventionally, is the ultimate in the negation of intrinsic
identifiability, even conventionally.

  Although he does not state
explicitly whether or not (this negation is accomplished) by
restricting experience to self-experience or other-experience, he
means to pose no such alternative, just as, in not accepting the
lamp's self-illumination while accepting its luminosity, he does
not restrict it to the alternative of illumination by itself or
by other means.

 One might object that in the case of the lamp, there is no fault
of non-substantiation by validating cognition even if it does not
illuminate itself, and yet consciousness is different from the lamp,
since it becomes non-substantiated by validating cognition if it
is not taken as self-consciously apperceptive.  

(Then we reply):
"How would you answer the argument that if a lamp does not
illuminate by itself and does not illuminate by any other, it is
not established thus as luminous, nor as anything else, and hence is
not established by validating cognition?"

  If you consider that,
although it is not luminous with respect to itself or to any other,
it illuminates pots etc., hence is established as luminous, well then,
(we suggest) it is just the same in the case of consciousness!  If
you further object that, since the actual cognition of objects itself
depends on apperceptive consciousness, without apperception the
object-cognition is not substantiated, we repeat that it is still
just like the case of the lamp.

  And if you still imagine that in
that case you will take your stand on the fact that lamps illuminate
themselves by themselves, (we must insist that) this is wrong, as then
it would be impossible for darkness to obscure it, and also darkness
itself would obscure itself.

  And if you accept that, then darkness
would be invisible.  

In short, since consciousness is designated
through its dependence on objects, it is without intrinsically
identifiable status, and objects themselves are just the same.

By this reason, not only are these two (subject and object)
conventionally mutually dependent, but the further point is that
due to the mere interdependent designativeness (of things),
apperceptive consciousness is inadmissible.

 This can also be understood from the reason refuting apperceptive
consciousness given (by Nagarjuna) in his Rebuttal of Objections:

If (you think) validating cognition self-substantiated,
then your validating cognition is substantiated
without requiring any objects,
since the self-established depends on no other.


 But you object that the "I" in the memory "I saw
blue before" is the person, and since that is excluded from
blue-cognition, how can memory of it be memory of blue-cognition?

 Although eye-consciousness perceiving blue and person seeing blue
are mutually exclusive, there is no contradiction in saying
"I saw blue" depending on that cognition's perception of blue.
So, how can that memory of "person," "I saw blue before," based
on the memory of blue-cognition's seeing blue, exclude the
memory of blue-perceiving-cognition?

##### C. DISTINCTIVE SPECIALTY OF NON-ACCEPTANCE OF PRIVATE (REASONING)

##### ORIGIN OF THE NEGATION OF PRIVATE DOGMATICISM, AND OTHER METHODS TO EXPLAIN ITS IMPORT.


The Scriptures definitely contain the meaning that if one
interprets them in one way, one must accept private dogmaticism,
and if one interprets them in another way, it is inappropriate
to do so.

 Nevertheless, nowhere in all the translated treatises of the
orthodox schools is it made explicit that inquiry into the question
of private dogmaticism and public dialecticism 100
 (reveals that)
private arguments are invalid and dialectical arguments valid,
except in the treatises of Chandrakirti and his followers.

 This becomes explicit in (Chandrakirti's) pioneering of the system
of the Champions when, in the Lucid Exposition, 101
 in the
context of showing the inapplicability of Bhavaviveka's criticism
of Buddhapalita's elucidation of the (opening) stanza (of the
Wisdom), "Not from self, not from other" he set forth many
proofs that Buddhapalita did not maintain any private dogmaticism
and that (further) it would be irrational for (any) Centrist to be
privately dogmatic, (setting forth also) many refutations of the
contrary opinion.
  And it is explicit also when, in the Four
Hundred Commentary,
 in the context of refuting the assertions
of Master Dharmapala, he briefly outlined the procedure to refute
private dogmaticism.

 As far as Bhavaviveka was concerned, he did not think there was
any disagreement between himself and Buddhapalita about whether
or not to accept private dogmaticism.
  He seemed (simply) to feel
that (Buddhapalita's) system did not live up to (an assumed tacit)
acceptance of private dogmaticism.
  This is the key to (Bhavaviveka's)
failure to assert any distinction between himself and Buddhapalita
in regard to the negatees (used) in their negations of intrinsic
reality in persons and things.
 
  Avalokitavrata, a follower
of Bhavaviveka, was familiar with the Lucid Exposition, hence one
might expect him to explain, during his commentary on (Bhavaviveka's)
refutation of Buddhapalita in the Wisdom Lamp, whether or
not he found Chandrakirti's criticism of Bhavaviveka to be applicable.

   Likewise, one might expect Shantarakshita, Kamalashila, and
their followers to set forth a rebuttal of Chandrakirti's refutation
of private dogmaticism.

   (However, the fact is) none of them
did so.

 In general, the two (Dialecticist) masters took as the ultimate
in profound and subtle reasonings those reasonings proving the
perfect viability of all systems such as causality in the absence
of the intrinsic reality which is negated as intrinsic identifiability
even conventionally, as well as (those reasonings) negating that
negatee (of intrinsic identifiability) by the very reason of
relativity, asserted clearly to be the relativity of (all things),
transcendental and non-transcendental.
  Moreover, among these
(ultimately subtle and profound reasonings), (they) took this
negation of dogmaticist privacy as the most subtle (of all).

 In this regard, a certain Pandit argues that the private logical
reason would be appropriate if there were substantiation by validating
cognition of both reason and the invariable concomitance proving the
probandum; but it is not appropriate, such not being the case.
(For) it is wrong to assert that a logical reason can be
authoritatively substantiated for both protagonist and antagonist,
since the protagonist does not know what is established by validating
cognition for the antagonist, as he cannot know the details of
the other's thoughts by either perception or inference; nor does he
know what is established by validating cognition for himself, as it
is always possible his judgment is in error.


 (But we respond that) this (approach) is utterly wrong, for if such
were the case, it would also be inappropriate to refute (an
antagonist with a public syllogism), even if one (based one's
argument upon) the assertions of the opponent (and not upon one's own
private assertion).
  For, one could not know the antagonist's position,
not knowing his thoughts, and one's own refutation through advancing
(the antagonist's) fallacies could be wrong, as it would always be
possible that one's judgment about those fallacies could be mistaken.

 (This same Pandit) argues that the reason that the invariable
concomitance (of reason with probandum) is not established by
validating cognition is that perception, although it can cognize
the concomitance of the presence of fire with the presence of smoke
in a kitchen, does not cognize the concomitance of the presence
of fire with the presence of smoke in all times and places; and
further, inference does not cognize the concomitance of the
probandum-property with a reason present at all times and places.

Thus, (he concludes) concomitance is established by mere conventional
assertion, and not by any validating cognition.

 This (argument) also is entirely wrong, because it negates (the
valid cognizability of concomitance) by distorting the import of
the exposition of the method for establishing concomitance given
in the logical texts.

  For, the import of the (logical) treatises
is certainly not that the proof of the concomitance of presence
of fire with presence of smoke, based on (the example of a kitchen),
is a proof of the concomitance of presence of fire of a kitchen with
presence of smoke of a kitchen.

  Otherwise, the reason of presence
of smoke in an occasionally smoky kitchen would prove the presence
of fire of that kitchen (always).

  This is because, if the reason
of presence of occasional smoke proved the invariable concomitance
of the presence of fire, then concomitance would be proved between
whatever is taken as reason and whatever is taken as (probandum-)
property (just by taking two things in that relationship).

And it is also because the mode of proof of that would be as
mentioned above (as denied to be the import of the treatises).

Thus, if the kitchen is the base for certification of the invariable
concomitance of fire-presence with smoke-presence, and the invariable
concomitance is the thing to be certified there, you (Pandit), if
(concomitance is) as you think, just show us an additional exemplary
case as a basis for certification of concomitance! 108

 Similarly, how could the proof, based on the (example) pot, of
the concomitance which proves the impermanence of sound by  the
reason of (its) production be no more than a proof of the
concomitance of the pot's impermanence with the pot's production?
Thus, do not wrongly construe (the nature of concomitance), since
the method to certify the reliability for all times and places
of precisely the establishment of concomitance of fire-presence
and impermanence with mere smoke (-presence) and (mere) production
(respectively), unspecified as to time and place, is the mention
(as examples) of the "smoke (-presence)" of this time and place
and of the "production" of this time and place.  Therefore, having
followed this reasoning, still to insist that the precise reversal
of the argument rebuts (my refutation of your position) is like a
drowning man's clutching at a bunch of straw!

 Now, (such a Pandit) might say that the face-value or habitual
perception of things is established without analysis by
commonsensical validating cognition, having refuted any validating
cognition unerring about its objects, giving the fact that the
opponent's system and not his own asserts the ability (of things)
to withstand rational analysis as the reason that the negated
fallacy does not rebound upon himself.

  Nevertheless, he does not
seem to (be able) to discern the difference between the analysis
as to conventional status and the analysis as to actual status
(of things), or the difference between the two types of Centrists'
(respective) analyses of actual status (of things).

  Finally,
although he constantly declares that "there is no intrinsic identity,
even conventionally," still, since he seems not to know how to
represent such (systems) as causality in the (condition of) the mere
nominal designation (of things), as the referents of conventional
designations cannot be discovered when (analytically) sought,
according to the above explanation, his assertions are no
more than (empty) talk.

 Again, some other (scholars) assert that the import of lack of the
private reason and private thesis is that the truthlessness which is
the simple exclusion of truth is not something that can be proved,
and that the false views (of antagonists) are negated by consequences
based on the antagonist's assertions or the ultimate implications
of those assertions, there being absolutely nothing established
by validating cognition.

 Still others say that all schemes of ultimate and superficial
(realities) are presented only for the view of others, and not as
one's own system.

  And they even say that "even that statement itself
was not made by me, but only appears (to be so made) in the view of
others!"

  (But) such talk never happened among the refuters
of private dogmaticism of ancient times, and is merely the chatter
of latter-day (philosophers).

 The majority of these above persons, while asserting the special
negatee of this system, negate the validated cognizability of
relativity, and thus are the chief target of our critique.  However,
I already explained and refuted their (theories) in my Stages
of the Path of Enlightenment, and so I will not enlarge upon
them here.


##### EXISTENCE OF REASON PROVING PROBANDUM, BUT NON-EXISTENCE OF PRIVATE REASON
##### i. HOW THERE IS PROOF OF PROBANDUM BY REASON

 Our  own interpretation (is as follows):  if you assert the
intrinsically identifiable status mentioned in the Elucidation of
Intention, you definitely must employ private (syllogisms), like
the orthodox Realists and Bhavaviveka etc.  If you do not admit
even conventionally any intrinsically identifiable thing, there is
no doubt that you must not assert private dogmaticism.

  Thus, the
negation of the subtle negatee likewise comes down to this.

  This
is not (a question of) not asserting private dogmaticist (syllogisms)
in the belief that if there is no intrinsically identifiable thing
even conventionally, then the establishment of the probandum of our
own position, the means of proof proving that, validating cognitions,
and their objects are all prohibited.

  In the Introduction Commentary,
when (Chandra) negates both positions through the analysis

"The
cause produces the effect through contact or without contact?"

as proof that the fault lodges with the opponent, (he states):

"Accordingly, this examination applies to (the view that) the produced
and the producer (are) intrinsically identifiable."  

Thus, he states
that the fault (arising) from the alternative analysis accrues to the
belief in intrinsically identifiable cause and effect, and that there
is no such fault in the position (that cause and effect) are without
intrinsic reality, just like illusion.

 Then, when the opponent uses his own arguments to rebut him, he
answers:

The fault you just advanced "Does the refutation
refute the refutand through contact or without contact?"--applies
to whoever has a definite position, but this consequence is not
applicable to me since this position does not exist for me.

 As the reason for the dissimilarity of the two,
he states in the verse that he has no position of his own, and in the
commentary, he adds:  "Because refutation and the refutand do not
have intrinsically real status.
"
 Thus, he explains "positionlessness"
 as meaning the lack of
intrinsically real or intrinsically identifiable assertions, which
has the same meaning as the reason explained for dissimilarity
(of positions) in the passage on causality.

 In this context (Chandra) goes on to quote (the Transcendent
Wisdom Scripture):

When Shariputra questioned Subhuti with the analysis,
"Do produced things obtain an unproduced attainment, or a produced
attainment?" he answered, "Neither is acceptable."  

And then to the
question, "Then is there no attainment or realization?" he answered,
"Though those two do exist, (their existence) is not in the manner
of a duality".

 He then quotes further:  
 
 "Those two and the
(stage of) streamwinner etc. are (existent) as mundane conventions;

in the absolute, there is no attainment and no realization.
"  

(And
continues to comment):
Here, because of the logical consequence of duality,
he negates the getting of attainments as either produced or unproduced
things.

  Since duality is inapplicable in (the condition of)
unreality, he accepts the reaching of attainments as non-analytic
mundane conventions; likewise, although refutation and refutee
do not exist either through contact or without contact (in the
ultimate), one should know that refutation refutes the refutee
conventionally.

Further:  "Refutation devoid of intrinsic reality
refutes the refutee, and a reason, even without (intrinsic) validation,
being devoid of intrinsic reality, proves the probandum.
"

 Thus, he declares that all proof and refutation should be taken
according to the dialogue between the two Elders.

  "Attainment"
means that to be acquired.

  As for the (suggestion that), when
questioned through analysis as to what attainment is acquired, if
neither is admitted, then (perhaps) there is no obtainment of result
(at all), that is to hold that, when analysis discovers no (result),
it negates any (possibility).

  "(Though those two) do exist" refers
to (things merely) not found by rational cognition, and not (totally)
negated--hence, they are said to exist.

  The statement that "It is not
in the manner of a duality" means that neither of the two analysands,
"produced" or "unproduced," are discovered.

  The rest of the quotation
elucidates the import that "ultimate non-existence" is the analytic
non-discovery (of anything) in the manner of duality, and "existence"
is conventional existence.  Although this is perfectly clear, since
the words "analytic" and "non-analytic" are difficult, one must know
all the above-explained four methods of analysis.

  "Duality is
inapplicable in (ultimate) unreality" means that if one admits
intrinsically identifiable existence, or existence that is not merely
established by force of convention, dichotomous analysis is applicable,
but if (one admits) unreality or intrinsic realitylessness, such
analysis is not applicable.

 Thus, in the Lucid Exposition, he states that validating
cognitions and their objects are presented in mutual dependence,
once intrinsically real status is denied them.

   And (Nagarjuna),
in his own commentary on Rebuttal of Objections, states with
examples that one can prove a probandum even without any intrinsic
reality.


 In general, with the rule (from the Wisdom):  "To whatever
emptiness is appropriate, everything is appropriate,"

(Nagarjuna) states repeatedly that for the position of emptiness with
respect to intrinsically identifiable reality, all systems of the
samsaric life-cycle and of Nirvana are valid.

  Thus, if we hold
as invalid the function of logical reasons proving probanda and the
function of validating cognitions apprehending their objects, it
merely demonstrates feebleness of our intelligence.

 As for the meaning of the Rebuttal of Objections statement, "If
I had any position, then there would arise that fault for me," it is
the same as (the above lines of Chandra), ".
applies to whoever has a (definite position)."; 

and likewise the following statement, "(But)
since I have no position, there only is no fault for me," has the same
meaning as (the above) "since this position does not exist for me
this consequence is not applicable."  Therefore, the import of
"thesis-lessness" and "positionlessness" (should be understood)
according to the explanation of the Introduction Commentary.

 (Further, Aryadeva) states in the Four Hundred:

Whoever takes no position at all,

Either "existence," "non-existence," or "both existence and non-existence,"

Cannot be (successfully) refuted

Even if (one tries) for a very long time.

This is not an authoritative source for (the Centrist's)
non-assertion of proof of probanda even in the non-analytic
conventional.

  For, although (Aryadeva) states that he cannot be
faulted because he has no position, (Chandra) explains, in the
Introduction Commentary, "because of the fact of the
inappropriateness of these dualistic (analytic) theories in regard
to the designatively existent, (an opponent's) refutations and
rebuttals will never succeed in faulting the Centrist in any way.
"

  (That is), since refutation through (dualistic) analysis such
as "is the attainment produced or unproduced?" is inapplicable to the
non-analytically posited designatively existent, established by
force of conventions, criticism through dualistic analysis will
never succeed in refuting (the Centrist).

  Therefore, when
(Chandra) in the Lucid Exposition uses these (above) references
as evidence for the statement "because he does not assert any other
position,"
 given as the reason for the improperness of a
Centrist's use of private dogmaticism, (he is only giving) evidence
for the (fact that) the Centrist does not assert ultimate status
or does not properly assert the intrinsic identifiability (of
anything).

  And the statement "if there is no such (assertion) and if
such (another type of assertion) is improper" negates private
dogmaticist (reasons), and does not negate a mere reason's proof of
its probandum.

  "Dualistic theory" is stated to have three patterns:
the theory that the negatee is a truth, and that the negation negating
it is (also) a truth; the theory that (the negatee) has intrinsic
identifiability and (its negation) total non-existence; and the
above-explained dualistic theory (about production and non-production
etc.).


##### ii. RULE OF NON-ASSERTION OF PRIVATE REASON

 Here, one might imagine that, if intrinsically identifiable
position, reason, and example are never possible, then not only
private dogmaticism, but also all functions are invalidated.

Nevertheless, this system establishes the validity of all functions,
such as proof of probanda, (precisely) by negating that (intrinsic
identifiability).
  Thus, what might be the reason for the impropriety
of the admission of the functional effectiveness of (conventional)
private reasons and probanda (in particular)?
 (Chandrakirti) explains this in the Lucid Exposition in three
(parts):  (giving) the reasoning negating the private (approach),
the way in which the opponent tacitly accepts that reasoning, and
the reason why his own approach is not likewise subject to the
same criticism.


 (First), (Chandra) criticizes Bhavaviveka's syllogism,  "Internal
media are certainly not self-produced absolutely, because they
exist, just as consciousness itself exists,"
 (in the following
manner):
Your use of the thesis-qualification "absolutely"
is unnecessary from your own standpoint, since you do not accept
production from self even superficially.

  (If you maintain that) it
relates to (the standpoint of) others, it would be better to refute
(your) heterodox (opponents) without any such qualification, since
they muddle the two realities and should be refuted in terms of
both.


(Further), as it is inappropriate to refute the claim of
self-production in mundane conventional terms, it is also
inappropriate to employ such qualifications in that (context);
for the mundane person assents to the mere arisal of an effect
from a cause without any analytic inquiry into whether it is
produced from self or from other.

   Again, if it is the case
that (you) wish to refute even the superficial production of the
eye etc. which your opponent believes to be absolute, this then
entails with respect to yourself either the thesis-fault of
subjectlessness, or the reason-fault of groundlessness, since you
yourself do not accept eye etc. as absolutely (existent).


If you object that my critique is inapplicable since, although
absolute eye etc. are not established, superficial eye etc. exist,
(I must ask you) then what is qualified by "absolutely?"  

If you
venture that it qualifies the negation of production since you are
negating ultimate production of superficial things such as eye etc.,
(I must insist) that this is wrong, because you did not state (it in)
that (way), and because, even if you had stated it thus, it would
entail the fallacy of subjectlessness with respect to the other
party.

 To rebut this critique, (Bhavaviveka) argues that,
when the Buddhist proves the impermanence of sound in (arguing with)
the Vaisheshika, (the subject and probandum) are considered in general,
and not as specifically qualified; because, if it was considered
(as qualified specifically), there would be no means of establishing
the probandum.

  For if the subject was considered to be sound as a
transformation of elements, it would be unestablished for the
Vaisheshika, and if it was considered to be sound as a property of
ether, it would be unestablished for the Buddhist.

  Thus, just as
(in that case) mere sound in general, with qualifications disregarded,
is considered to be the subject, so (in this case) the mere eye etc.
are considered as subject, disregarding all qualifications such as
"absolute" and "superficial," and there is no fault of the
non-establishment of subject.

 In answer, (Chandra) refutes (Bhavya) by demonstrating the
arguments such as (that based on) the mutually exclusive difference
between the erroneous and the non-erroneous (objects and cognitions),
in the light of Bhavya's own claim that the intrinsic actualities of
subjects such as "eye" are not discovered by mere erroneous
(cognitions).

  The gist of these (arguments is as follows).
  It is
inappropriate to posit "mere eye etc.," disregarding qualifications
in light of the two realities, as subjects of the syllogisms proving
the absence of production from self of eye etc.; because the validating
cognition that encounters that subject is a cognition that is
unmistaken about the intrinsic reality of eye etc. (according to
your own system); and because, as unmistaken cognition does not mistake
intrinsic reality, the object it encounters cannot be an erroneous
object which falsely appears to have intrinsic identifiability when
it actually does not.

  In regard to the way in which the first reason
is admitted (by Bhavya), in a philosophical system that claims that
whatever exists, exists by virtue of its own objectivity, (a cognition)
that errs in its perception of intrinsic identifiability cannot be
represented as (validly) discovering its proper object.

  Any sort of
validating cognition, either non-conceptual or conceptual (i.e.,
perception or inference), must be unmistaken about the intrinsic
identity of its validly cognized object, whether perceptual or
conceptual.

  Thus, a validating cognition must derive its validity
from an object which, not being merely a conventional, nominal
designation, has intrinsic objectivity or intrinsic reality as its own
actual condition; and this is just what (Bhavya's) own system claims.

(Finally), the second reason is established by the fact that an
object's being discovered by such a type of validating cognition
precludes its being an erroneous object.

  Likewise, an object's
being discovered by erroneous cognition precludes its being a
non-erroneous object.
  Therefore, (Bhavya) has not been able to


avoid the fault of (his syllogism's) having an unestablished subject
(as Chandra previously pointed out).

 (Here) some might object that, "just as, in regard to the validating
cognition perceiving sound, there is no need to establish it to be
qualified as either permanent or impermanent, having first restricted
it to that alternative, in order for it to serve as a means of
establishing the subject sound, so it is not necessary to establish
cognition as qualified as either erroneous or non-erroneous, having
first restricted it to that alternative, in order to show it
to be the
validating cognition that is the means of establishing the subject.

In the same way, even though the validating cognition perceiving sound,
having restricted sound to being either permanent or impermanent, finds
no permanent sound nor any impermanent sound, that does not preclude
its perceiving (mere) sound.

  Likewise, even though the validating
cognitions perceiving eye etc. do not find eye etc. as either true
objects or false objects, having restricted them to being either
true or false, that does not preclude their perceiving (mere)
eye etc.  Therefore, those arguments that it is inappropriate
to hold mere eye etc. as subjects (of Bhavya's syllogism) are
invalid.
"

 Since such doubts as these would never even arise for Bhavaviveka
and his followers or for the Realist sages, Chandrakirti does not
explicitly dispel them.

  Nevertheless, since they do arise for my
contemporaries who do not understand this dispute, I will explain.

When one examines whether an object is established by
validating cognition or not, to pronounce it "established by
validating cognition," it is necessary to cognize the indicated
object as established as it appears to a non-conceptual validating
cognition, or as established as it is ascertained or constructed
by a conceptual validating cognition.

  And that means that it is
a genuine object, since it is presented as established as it appears
to us or is ascertained by us, and since (our) cognition is presented
as non-erroneous in its perceptual object or in its ascertained
or conceptual object.

  Thus, there is no question of (an artificial
separation between the object and its cognitive status, as if) the
object alone were restricted to an alternative (of being true or
false etc.) and its cognitive status were not so restricted to that
alternative.  And therefore, since a genuine object is presented as
that discovered by a cognition unmistaken with regard to its intrinsic
identity, how can the truth or falsity of an object be a question
of alternative analysis of the object and not of (the object) as
presented
to cognition?  

(Of course) these (methods of verifying objects) are
the methods of establishing (objects) by validating cognition used by
the disputants who claim that existents exist by their intrinsic
objectivity (such as the Dogmaticists), and not our (Dialecticist)
method (of establishment of objects by validating cognition).

 Thus, the Dogmaticist position is that, although genuine objects
such as eye (-medium) are perceived by non-erroneous cognitions,
they need not be established as qualified as either conventionally
or ultimately objective, (that is) with their status in light of the
two realities (determined), and that, although it is proper to analyze
the ultimate existence or non-existence (of an object) when it is
considered as that qualified (by ultimacy or superficiality), how
can criticisms expressed through examination of (an object's)
qualification by (one or the other of) the two realities be applicable
when (the object) is merely considered as a general subject (of a
syllogism)?  

But Chandra considers that objects so (posited by
Dogmaticists) become objectively existent, which is just the same
in meaning as "ultimately existent," thus cannot possibly be "merely
subjects," since (fundamentally) considered so qualified (as ultimately
existent etc.).

  And he thus refutes (the contention that) (eye etc.)
are merely considered as unqualified general subjects (of the
syllogism).

 If the essence of these (arguments) is understood, one can know the
reasons why the Dogmaticists explain that "the analysis of the
superficial reality divides it into true and false (objects), because
although both can appear (to ordinary cognitions), (the former) are
able to perform functions, and the (latter are) not able to perform
functions,"
 and yet they do not divide the subjective
(cognitions) into true and false.  

(And one can also know the reasons)
why the Dialecticists represent both subjects and objects as true
or false according to the mundane (usage) itself, and yet do not
so present them in their own system (all in the superficial
being false).

 Finally, if (the Dogmaticists venture that) the subject (of the
syllogism) is presented as established (merely) by erroneous cognition,
in which things do not have the intrinsic identifiability they appear
to have to both conceptual and non-conceptual cognitions, then the
probandum (of the syllogism), namely intrinsic realitylessness,
would already have been established; and how could it be acceptable
for an opponent for whom this remains to be proven?  Therefore, (even
in this case) (Bhavaviveka) would still have the fault of unestablished
subject (according to his own lights).


 (Here, the puzzled contemporaries further object that) if
objects discovered by mistaken cognition and non-erroneous knowables
were contradictories, then also the object discovered by inferential
rational cognition and the ultimate reality would also be
contradictories, because it is inadmissible that (ultimate truth)
could be discovered merely by erroneous cognitions and hence must be
discovered by cognition unmistaken with regard to the intrinsic reality
(of its objects).

  Thus all superficial (objects) would become
(ultimate realities), because they are encountered by the Victor's
phenomenologically omniscient intuition; and yet the word "merely"
excludes their discovery by an unmistaken cognition.

 The first criticism does not apply, because, although inferential
rational cognition is a mistaken cognition insofar as it is mistaken
in regard to (the mode of existence of) its apparent object, it is
not the case that everything it discovers is the result of mistaken
cognition.

  For example, our (correct) perception of the sound of a
conch, which is both sound and (intrinsically) false, does not preclude
our failing to perceive a false sound.

  (In regard to the second
criticism,) a suspicion (such as the objector's) might well arise
when considering the context, but the express intention of the
speaker is to refute that (superficial objects) are discovered by
analytic cognition that analyzes the modes of existence (of those
objects), thus he says "merely," and he does not refute
(the possibility) that such
objects can be encountered by non-erroneous cognitions; because as
(Chandrakirti) says in the Lucid Exposition, "We say 'what's
the use of such application of fine analysis to mundane conventions?'
as the superficial is found to have its self-existence merely by
erroneous cognition."
  

Although this mode of explanation
(of Chandra's) does not correspond with his explanations elsewhere
concerning the admission (by Bhavaviveka) that the ultimate status
of the basic subject (of the syllogism) is lost, there is no
discrepancy with his theory on the refutation of private dogmaticism.

 These (above explanations aim to) refute the import (of Bhavya's
methodology); now, we should refute his example.

 When the Buddhist proves the impermanence of sound to the Vaisheshika,
both systems do not verify (sound) with any validating cognition that
finds sound (either) as a property of ether (or) as an elemental
transformation.

  Nevertheless, they can point to "this thing" which is
the mere sound that is the goal of validating cognitions.
  However,
the case is different when the advocate of emptiness of intrinsic
reality proves to the advocate of non-emptiness of intrinsic reality
that eye etc. are not produced from themselves.

  For not only can
they not discover any objective existence or any objective
non-existence, but also they cannot point out to each other "Such a
thing as 'this' we both encounter as the actual thing to use as
subject of argument.
"
  Thus, the contention of the Dogmaticists
such as Bhavaviveka, that although there is no pointing out of any
general (subject) disregarding that kind of qualification (such as
"encounterably objectively existent" or not), one can apprehend a
general subject disregarding such qualifications as "ultimately" or
"truly established or not," cannot be maintained; because if
something exists objectively, it is a thing that exists truly.

Thus, as this (disagreement) occurred on account of the key point of
the disagreement about the measure of the negatee, also in the case
of the proof of the impermanence of sound, the two systems can show
that "sound is established" even though not according to their
respective systems' qualifications, as long as that does not involve
any validating cognition, as might be expressed by "(we) both
(accept) a validating cognition encountering sound that serves
as a validating cognition for this kind of manifestation of sound.
"

(Now) this (analysis) is in terms of the protagonist's assertion
of objective existence, but even if the Dialecticist were to play
the role of protagonist, he could not show any method of establishing
(a subject generally) by a validating cognition encountering the
subject, disregarding qualification as to objective existence or
non-existence, to such an antagonist (who asserts objective existence).

 By means of these reasonings, you should also understand the method
of (proving Bhavya's) non-establishment of the reason.

 (Chandrakirti) appropriately criticizes (Bhavya) by specific analysis
as to whether the subject is discovered by true or false cognition,
since Bhavaviveka himself criticizes (the Analysts) as to the meaning
of their reason in the syllogism "the internal media are productive
causal conditions, because the Victor said so," by analysis in the
light of the two realities, saying "if you say that it is in a
superficial sense, it is unsatisfactory to you yourself, and if you
say it is in an ultimate sense, it is unsatisfactory to me."

And the reason for this is the key point that the two realities are
set up as those discovered (respectively) by cognitions that truly
see knowable objects and by cognitions that superficially or falsely
see knowable objects.

  As (Chandra) states in the Introduction:


Through true and false perceptions of all things,

They are held as having two realities;

The object of true perception is Thatness,

That of false perception said to be superficial reality.


 Here, when one only uses the twofold analysis relating to the two
realities in regard to the reason, one must ask, "what is the sense
of the reason?"  

However, when one makes a threefold analysis (of
the reason) including the (possibility of) a mere (general) (reason)
unqualified by either of the two (realities), one must ask "What do
you set forth as a reason?"

 (Chandrakirti) states, as the reason why the above criticisms do not
similarly apply to his own methodology, his non-acceptance of private
dogmaticism:  "Syllogisms proving probanda in our own system are
sufficient if established for the antagonist, since their only purpose
is to refute his false imaginations.
"

   (He goes on to explain)
that it is sufficient if either party (to a dispute) accepts (a
subject, reason, etc.), giving the example of a mundane dispute, and
that even Dignaga, who asserts that in (formal) proof and refutation,
it is necessary that both establish (subject and reason, etc.), should
in fact accept the former method, since (even he must admit that)
refutation through Scripture and personal inference are only
established for oneself.

 The meaning of "private dogmaticism" is (illustrated) in certain
contexts in the Wisdom Lamp where (Bhavya) generates syllogisms
for establishing his probanda, having certified the status of his
reason and his subjects both (in proof and refutation) with validating
cognition, i.e., privately, from the objective condition of the
referents, without deriving (his position) from the assertions of his
antagonist.

  These (passages) are marked by expressions such as "it
is stated in 'independent' (rang dbang du) terms," or "in terms
of refutation" where (the Tibetan) "independent" (rang dbang)
is synonymous with (the Tibetan) "private" (rang rgyud).

 (In conclusion), (the Dialecticist) accepts both reasons and
probanda without accepting private reasons and probanda, since the
probanda are not yet established by antagonists who assert that
existents are intrinsically, objectively existent, and since he cannot
certify that "such and such is the method for establishing by a
validating cognition an object which is not qualified, as above,
as either objectively existent or as objectively inexistent.

  And
when (a Dialecticist) sets forth a public syllogism proving the
realitylessness of the objective status of a sprout, employing the
reason of relativity and the example of a mirror-image, he does
not call (his syllogism) "public" and "not established for both
(parties)" because he himself does not assert the concomitance
between the sprout and relativity or between relativity and intrinsic
realitylessness, but because, as above, (his reason etc.) will not
be established independently by validating cognition for his
antagonist.

  Thus, (a "public syllogism") means that (it employs
reasons, subjects, etc., which are) not established for both
(parties) by validating cognition in such a (private) manner.

 Although the sprout and its relativity are established by natural,
conventional, validating cognitions in the mental processes of both
protagonist and antagonist, that (type of validating cognition) is
confused for the antagonist with (a presumed) validating cognition
encountering intrinsic objective existence, and the two are not
distinct for him until his (authentic) view is generated.

  Hence
the protagonist is unable to show him (anything established by merely
conventional validating cognition) until such time (as his confusion
is gone), even though the protagonist himself distinguishes (the two
types of validating cognition).

  Although Dialecticists among
themselves may demonstrate methods of establishment (of subjects etc.)
by validating cognitions without deriving them from each other's
assertions, (they employ) validating cognitions presented in verbal,
conventional terms, and not presented in terms of the intrinsic
objectivity of the phenomena (involved).

  Hence, (the employment of)
private dogmaticism is inappropriate (for them also).

 In regard to (phenomena) such as a sprout, there are three perceptual
habits:  one holding it to be objectively existent; one holding it to
be objectively inexistent; and one holding it without qualifying it in
either way.

  If the distinction is clearly understood that all three of
these habit-patterns exist in the mental process of one in whom the
authentic view is generated, but that only the first and the last are
present in the mental process of one in whom no authentic view has been
generated, then one will put a stop to the following false views:
(the view) that rationality does not put a stop to all perception
(controlled) by the mental constructions (such as) "This is it";
(the view) that all practices before the generation of the authentic
view, such as cultivation of the will to enlightenment, are but
truth-habits, or sign habits; and (the view) that after one lays
claim to having generated in mind the authentic view, there will be
no intentionality in all one's acts.

 Therefore, it is not enough, when proving a probandum with a public
reason, for the antagonist only to accept it.

  The subject, probandum, and the reason etc. must be established by (conventional)
validating cognition recognized from one's own point of view, and even
the antagonist must definitely or somewhat accept it.

  Otherwise,
if (the antagonist) is mistaken about the conceptual object, he
will be unable to generate the view that realizes ultimate reality.

And this very fact of the indispensability of conventional validating
cognition as the cause of encountering the supreme reality is the
import of (Nagarjuna's famous) statement:  "Without relying on
conventions, the supreme reality will not be understood.
"

 (Finally), one might suppose that, according to this (critique by
Chandrakirti), the Dogmaticists such as Bhavaviveka, since they
(by implication) assert what amounts to ultimate or true status
(of phenomena), should not be classified as Centrists.

  (However),
we cannot say "I accept that as a pot," when we ascertain its
roundness yet are not sure that it is a pot, since it is yet to be
established by validating cognition.

  And we cannot say that the
Vaisheshika is not a philosopher who asserts a whole substantially
different (from its parts), even though (in our view) he proves by
validating cognition what amounts to be the non-existence of a
whole "pot" substantially different from its parts.

  Just so, those
(Dogmaticist) sages are Centrists, since they clearly assert
truthlessness, refuting with numerous rational methods the true
existence of phenomena.
  And this does not contradict (Chandrakirti's)
statement that, if one is a Centrist, it is wrong to engage in
private dogmaticism, just as, although it is wrong for a monk holding
vows to break them, it is not necessary that he not be a monk by the
mere fact of his breaking them (to some degree).

### CHAPTER VI

##### AVOIDAL OF CONTRADICTION BETWEEN THE (DIALECTICIST) SYSTEM AND THE SCRIPTURES

##### AVOIDAL OF CONTRADICTION WITH THE ELUCIDATION OF INTENTION
 Now one may wonder, if the interpretations of the other masters
are as explained above, how does this Master interpret the
differentiation between reality and realitylessness with reference
to the three natures and the method of presenting interpretable
and definitive meanings of the Elucidation of Intention?
 On this subject, there is no clear explanation in the original
treatises of Nagarjuna and Aryadeva, nor did Buddhapalita explicate
the details of this (question).

  However, (Chandrakirti), in the
Introduction Commentary, explains four theories (of the Idealists)
to be interpretable in meaning: (namely), the theories that the first
two natures (respectively) do not and do exist with intrinsic
identifiability; that there is a fundamental consciousness; that
there are no external objects; and that there is final genealogical
determinism.

  His own words are as follows, (first quoting an
Idealist):

"This scriptural reference makes it clear that even
other Scriptures of that same type are interpretable in meaning.
"
Which are the "scriptures of that same type?"

(They are) such as the Elucidation of Intention, teaching
the three natures, imagined, relative, and perfect, with the imagined
utterly non-existent and the relative utterly existent; and (teaching
that) "The grasping consciousness is deep and subtle, all seeds
streaming (therein) like flowing water; thus I do not show it to
the naive, thinking it inappropriate, lest they construe it as
a self.
"  

And such as these are explained to be interpretable by
the Scripture:  "Just as a doctor prescribes medicines for the
sickness of invalids, so the Buddha teaches even 'mind-only' to
some living beings.
"

Thinking that the last (of the four doctrines)
could be understood as interpretable from the proof of (the doctrine
of) the unique vehicle executed (by Nagarjuna) in the Scripture
Synthesis,
  (Chandra) in the Introduction Commentary
proves by reason and reference the interpretability of the first
three (doctrines), this quote showing the (proof of) their
interpretability through scriptural reference.  There are two kinds
of "mind-only" references, those that negate external things and
those that do not.

  With reference to the type of Scripture that
makes such statements as "The externally apparent does not exist.",
  (Chandra states) that the Mission to Lanka clearly shows
their interpretability.

  For, the statements of "mind-only" are not
in terms of the Teacher's own system but in terms of the inclination
of the disciples, just as the doctor does not give medicine to
particular patients out of his own whim, but in accord with the
particular pattern of the patient's sickness.

 (Chandra) continues saying "Likewise the mention of Buddha-essence
in the Buddha's discourses" and concludes his quotations by
saying, "Thus, such kinds of Scriptures, all of which are accepted
as definitive in meaning by the Idealists, are clearly shown to
be interpretable in meaning by this (very) scriptural reference."

This passage is explained (by Jayananda) in his Subcommentary
as showing the interpretability of the statements of "mind-only," by
using the statements of the interpretability of the "Buddha-essence"
as examples, and he also explains "this scriptural reference" as
referring to the Ten Stages refutation of the world-creator
in the context of the realization of relativity.

  (But) this is
incorrect, since (Chandra) in his own commentary uses the
interpretability of "mind-only" statements as the example, and then
proves the interpretability of all Scriptures taken as definitive
by the Experientialists by reason of the statement of the
interpretability of the Buddha-essence (doctrine).

  Thus, "by
this scriptural reference," in this context referring to one of
two (preceding quotes), refers to the Mission to Lanka indication
of the interpretability of the Buddha-essence (doctrine) and of the
(fact that) realitylessness is to be understood as the inner (gist)
of all the Scriptures.

   And, as for the Ten Stages refutation
of any other creator (than the mind), this is stated as evidence for
the fact that the "only" in the expression "mind-only" does not
exclude external things, and not as evidence showing that the negation
of external things is interpretable in meaning.

  "Such kinds of
Scriptures" refers to those that give teachings such as those in
the Elucidation of Intention above, and does not show that the
Idealists assert the definitiveness of Scriptures that show the
Buddha-essence (doctrine) to be interpretable!  There is no question
about both these points.

  Our own view is that (Chandra's) quotation
of the statement of the interpretability of the Buddha-essence
(doctrine) is the (scriptural) proof that the Elucidation of
Intention doctrine of the fundamental consciousness is not to be
taken literally.

 In this regard, it is first necessary to understand that the teaching
of the (Buddha-) essence is not literally intended, as the
Mission to Lanka states:

Those Scriptures that teach according to the
inclinations of living beings are erroneous in meaning, not giving
the message of Thatness.

  A teaching which is like a mirage,
deceiving thirsty beasts by having no water, may generate devotion
in the naive-minded, but is not the message that establishes the
wisdom of the Holy Ones.

  Therefore, you should follow the (intended)
meaning, and should not be attached to the expression.


 Further, in the Mission to Lanka, Mahamati
questions:

The Lord promulgates the Buddha-essence in the
discourses, saying it is naturally radiant, primordially pure,
endowed with the thirty-two marks, and existing within the bodies
of all living beings.

  You say it is like a precious gem, wrapped
in a filthy rag, being permanent, stable, and eternal, but wrapped
by the defilement of the aggregates, elements, and sense-media.

How is this Buddha-essence-theory different from the soul-theory
of the heterodox?  

For the heterodox also espouse a soul as
permanent, inactive, qualityless, all-pervading, and
indestructible.

 In answer, the Lord said that the Buddhas teach
the Buddha-essence (intending) the objective selflessness, the
non-apparent object, with its synonyms such as "emptiness,"
"signlessness," and "wishlessness," in order to avoid the fear of
selflessness on the part of the naive and to educate the heterodox
who are attracted to soul-theories, and thus it is not the same
as the heterodox soul-theories.

  Present and future bodhisattvas
should not become attached to it as a self.

  Thinking that those
beings whose thoughts have been dominated by soul-theories will more
quickly come to enlightenment if their thoughts dwell in the sphere
of the three doors of liberation, the (Buddhas) teach the
Buddha-essence to that end.

  Thus one should understand the
Buddha-essence as corresponding to selflessness, in order to
eliminate heterodox views.

  I quote (and paraphrase) here no
further, fearing prolixity.

-----

 Thus, (Chandra) proves the non-similarity between the theory of
the Buddha-essence and the theory of the existence of self by the
reason that (the Buddha's) statement intimates as its intended
basis the emptiness which is objective selflessness, out of the
need to eliminate the (disciples') fear of selflessness and
gradually to lead those attached to soul-theories toward selflessness.

Such being the case, the soul-theorists are intending just what they
are teaching, whereas the Teacher's intended meaning, which he
considers when teaching, and his literal meaning are utterly
different.

  When the soul-theorists teach the permanent etc. self,
they are at all times certainly and firmly committed to their own
literal meaning, whereas the Teacher sometimes teaches as if his
literal meaning were true, but then later (indicates that he did
so) in order to lead around to the intimated meaning he was intending.

Thus, (Chandra shows we) must see through the (apparent) similarity,
saying "the two are not the same."  This clearly shows that if we
literally accept the teaching of Buddha-essence as previously
expounded, we would be the same as the theorists of soul-existence;
and that very fact is the refutation of the explicit (teaching of
the Buddha-essence).

  Thus, what intelligent person would dispute
whether or not such statements (of Buddha-essence) in other
Scriptures are established as interpretable in meaning, when this
Scripture has shown the intimated basis, the need, and the refutation
of literalness?   It is very clear about the inappropriateness
of literal acceptance, using the example of a mirage and saying,
"one should follow the (intimated) meaning, and should not be attached
to the (literal) expression.
"  

If, in spite of this, one does not
accept the elucidation of (Chandrakirti), but accepts the
interpretability of this teaching from rational refutation
of its literalness, that being the personal precept of the Indian
sages, and yet still does not admit that the above Scripture
demonstrates the fact (of the Buddha-essence's interpretability),
then one merely exhibits one's own true nature!
 
 
 Further, in the Scripture Synthesis, (Nagarjuna) introduces all
the above quoted scriptural passages with the remark, "the Tathagata,
by teaching a variety of doors to the (Great) Vehicle in terms of
(the inclinations of) the disciples, teaches this very profound
ultimate reality.
"  

"This profound ultimate reality" refers directly
to the just previously quoted references from the Transcendent
Wisdom, etc., teaching the emptiness which is objective selflessness.

   And "in terms of the disciples" means that such explanations
are influenced by the inclinations of the disciples, which
has the same meaning as (Chandra's) statement above that "this is
the teaching to generate devotion in the naive, and is not the
teaching of ultimate reality.
"

 As for the way in which literal acceptance (of the Buddha-essence
theory) is the same as the advocacy of the existence of self, (this
literal acceptance may be formulated as the assertion that) the
Buddha-essence exists as literally taught, the Buddha not having
taught the Buddha-essence thinking of the intimated meaning of
emptiness, non-production, or selflessness, etc., which are the
mere exclusion of the fabrications of objective self or of
identifiably existent production, but (having meant it) literally
as he taught it.

  And the (Buddha-essence's) permanence is not merely
that indestructibility which is the mere exclusion of the negatee,
destruction, but is a permanence which arises as an established entity,
like (the colors) yellow or blue, not needing to be represented
as the
exclusion of negatee.  

Such being the case, as there is no
difference (between this position and) the type of permanence
(maintained) by the non-Buddhist advocates of the permanent self,
(this position) amounts to an assertion of a permanent phenomenon.

The refutation of this (theory) is (accomplished by) the elucidations
in the higher and lower orthodox schools of the reasonings refuting
the permanence advocated by the heterodox (philosophers), since those
(Buddhist scholars) do not accept any such (permanent) thing.

 Once one asserts the determination of a permanent thing which is
not merely a negation excluding destruction, one is not suitably
receptive to any sort of explanation of the two selflessnesses,
taught to be the selfless reality which is the mere exclusion of
the fabrications, the two "selves". 

As these Scriptures have
stated above, (the Buddhas) declare (the Buddha-essence, etc.)
for the sake of those who are attached to self-theories, in order
to eliminate their fear of selflessness.

 Therefore, there are two modes (of teachings) with interpretable
meaning.

  There are those interpretable meaning teachings for the
sake of gradually leading to reality those Buddhists who are
suitably receptive to explanations of the ordinary personal
selflessness and the gross objective selflessness; and
showing the refutation of their literal meaning is extremely
difficult.

  (Secondly,) there are those interpretable meaning
teachings taught in order to educate those of the heterodox type
who, as explained above, are not ready for the full explanation
of even the ordinary personal selflessness, as they either openly
advocate the heterodox self or else have a great habitual affinity
for such views from their former lives; and it is easy to show the
refutation of their literal meaning.

 If thus the doctrine of the existence of a (Buddha-) essence which
is permanent, etc., is interpretable in meaning, how does one
establish the interpretability of (the doctrine of) fundamental
consciousness?

 The two (expressions, "Buddha-essence" and "fundamental
consciousness") are repeatedly declared to be synonymous; thus,
from the Dense Array Scripture:

The various earths are the fundamental consciousness,
and so also are the Buddha-essences.

 The Tathagatas indicate that
very nature by means of the expression "fundamental consciousness.
"
Although the "essence" is renowned as the "fundamental," the
feeble-minded are unaware of it.


 Likewise, the Mission to Lanka mentions that
"the Buddha-essence, renowned as the 'fundamental consciousness,'
is endowed with the seven (auxiliary) consciousnesses.
"

Thus, they are the same, being verbally synonymous considering
their intended meaning, in spite of the fact that they are not shown
to be literally (and conceptually) equivalent, the one being permanent,
the other impermanent, since the fundamental consciousness is taught
intending the very same thing intended by teaching of the essence.
Such being the case, the demonstration of the former's interpretability
establishes the latter as interpretable in meaning.

   Such is the
view of Chandra, as he states in the Introduction Commentary that
"it must be acknowledged that it is precisely emptiness that (the
Buddha) indicated by the expression 'fundamental consciousness,' in
order to introduce the intrinsic reality of all phenomena.
"

 Thus, although that intended is the same thing (when speaking of
"essence" and "fundamental"), the disciples are different.
  The
disciple for whom the "fundamental consciousness" is declared is
suitably receptive to the teaching of the ordinary personal
selflessness and for the objective selflessness which is (defined as)
emptiness of subject-object-duality.

  (We know this) because such
(a disciple) is unable to understand the intrinsic realitylessness
of all persons and things; because the fundamental consciousness
is presented out of the necessity of teaching emptiness with respect
to external objects, as (Chandra) says in the Introduction:

"Fundamental consciousness exists!"  "Person
exists!"  "These aggregates alone exist!" -- These teachings are
for the sake of those who do not understand Thatness, the most
profound of things.


 (Finally), the source that shows the interpretability
of the differentiation of the first two (of the three) natures with
regard to not existing and existing (respectively) with intrinsic
identifiability is the Mission to Lanka passage quoted in the
Introduction Commentary immediately after the scriptural citations
that show the interpretability of the above doctrines; namely, the
statement, "Mahamati, this inner understanding of the Scriptures of
all Buddhas has the nature of emptiness, productionlessness,
non-duality, and intrinsic realitylessness."  

Thus, (the Buddha here)
declares that any sort of Scripture whatsoever should be understood
as having this very meaning (of non-duality, etc.).

 Well then, how does this system present the interpretability and
definitiveness of the three wheels (of Dharma)?

 (Even) in the first wheel, the statements of intrinsic realitylessness
of persons and things are definitive in meaning.

  (However,) (the
explanation of) personal (selflessness) through negation of merely
substantial self-sufficiency (of a supposed self) different in nature
from the aggregates, rather than through negation of the intrinsic
identifiability (of that supposed self) is interpretable in meaning.

That intended by such (explanations) is the mere conventional existence
(of self).

  As for the necessity (for such an interpretable teaching,)
it is in order to avoid the arisal of nihilism (in such a disciple)
from the teaching of the emptiness of persons and things with regard
to intrinsic identifiability, to cultivate their mental processes
by teaching the gross selflessness, and (finally) to introduce them
to the subtle selflessness.

  And the refutation of the literal
acceptability (of these teachings) consists in the reasonings
negating intrinsically identifiable status (of things).

 Next, in the second wheel, the statements that persons and things
are empty with respect to ultimate or intrinsically identifiable
existence while yet existing according to mundane conventionality
are the ultimate in definitive meaning.

  They were taught to those
Universalists able to understand the equivalency of relativity empty
of intrinsic identifiability with emptiness with respect to intrinsic
reality, since (causal processes) such as bondage and liberation are
definitely non-viable (if presumed to) have intrinsically identifiable
status, and it is indispensably necessary to accept the relativity of
such (causal processes as) bondage and liberation.

  In the abbreviated
teachings of such (second wheel Scriptures) as the Heart of
Transcendent Wisdom, such as "those five aggregates should be
precisely viewed as empty of any intrinsic reality,"
 the negatee
is not explicitly qualified with the expression "in the ultimate,"
yet is implicitly so qualified, as such (qualification) must be
understood from the context of the elucidations of (all) statements
of emptiness with respect to intrinsic identifiability.
  
  
  Or, even
if such were not the case, such (qualification) must be understood
as implicit (in the abbreviated versions), since once the qualification
"in the ultimate" is applied in such (extensive) versions as the
Mother Scripture, it must be understood (as implicit) in all
Scriptures of the same class.

  For example, when a contemporary
author composes a treatise, and expresses himself consistently on a
certain subject, we must understand (as implicit) (his consistent
expression) in those contexts where he does not so express himself
(for brevity's sake, etc.).

 Finally, (in the third wheel), the statements of the lack of intrinsic
identifiability of the first nature and of the intrinsically
identifiable existence of the latter two natures (are interpretable
in meaning).
  
  (They are) taught for those (disciples) of the Universal
Vehicle class who would find no ground to establish cause-effect
and bondage-liberation in the intrinsic realitylessness which is
emptiness with respect to intrinsically identifiable status, in order
to forestall their falling into the great nihilism from
(misinterpreting) the teaching of the middle wheel and in order to
introduce them to the subtle objective selflessness by cultivating
their mental processes by means of the teaching of the gross
objective selflessness.

  (These statements were made) intending
the Idealist differentiation between the first nature and the latter
two natures, as (respectively) being established verbally and
conventionally and being identifiably established on the conventional
level.

  The refutations of the literal acceptability (of this third
wheel teaching) consists of the formulations of the Centrist treatises
(to the effect that), while there is no rational refutation of the
ultimate non-establishment of persons and things, all presentations
such as causality are impossible if (things) are ultimately or
intrinsically identifiably existent.

 Such is (Chandra's) method of presenting the interpretability and
definitiveness (of the three wheels of Dharma), which, although
in disagreement with the formulation of the Elucidation of
Intention, is consistent with the King of Samadhis and the
Teaching of Aksayamati.

 We must not confuse the (above teachings about the) turning of the
wheel of Dharma three times with the meaning of the (following)
passage from the Questions of King Dharanishvara:

Just as the jeweller perfects a gem by stages
with the threefold cleansing and the threefold rubbing, 

so the
Conqueror, knowing the scope of the impure living beings, 

makes
those infatuated with the world tired at heart and causes them
to engage in the religious discipline by means of the doctrines
of renunciation, such as "impermanence," "misery," "selflessness,"
and "ugliness".
  
He causes them to realize the deep process of the
Tathagata doctrine, by means of the teaching of emptiness,
signlessness, and wishlessness.
  
  Next, he installs those living
beings in the Buddha-realm by means of the teaching of
irreversibility and the teaching of the purification of the
three spheres (of acts, i.e., agent, action, and recipient).
 
 And
those living beings, having become equalized in their various
genealogies
and faculties, realize deeply the ultimate nature of the
Tathagata, and are dubbed "the unexcelled worthies for
offerings.
"

 Thus, this (passage teaches) how a single person
is led first into the Individual Vehicle.  Then, being introduced
into the Buddha-realm, the Universal Vehicle, finally he reaches
the stage of attaining Buddhahood.

  (On the other hand,) the
three wheels of Dharma are turned for the sake of Individual Vehicle
and Universal Vehicle disciples of different characters.

  (This is
also evident from the fact that) the Scripture Synthesis quotes
this scriptural passage as a proof of the fact that there is ultimately
one vehicle,
 since even the Individualists enter (eventually)
the Universal Vehicle and attain Buddhahood.

  Thus, as both the
first two stages (mentioned in the passage) lead (the disciple) in
the Individual Vehicle, the selflessness of that first stage is like
the selflessness included in the four (aspects of the first Holy
Truth,#i.e.,) impermanence etc., said in the Four Hundred to be
a means of cultivating a (disciple's) character before teaching him
the view of emptiness.

  Such (selflessness) is the absence of the self
that is (presumed to be) independent among its possessions.

  (In the passage above), "irreversibility" means that once one enters that
(vehicle) it is not necessary to go on any different vehicle.

 Here one might object that if the meaning of the Scriptures is (both)
as the Idealists elucidate it and (also) as the Centrists elucidate
it differently, then it becomes a matter of internal contradictions
for the speaker (of the scriptural discourses), and the meaning of
the Scriptures is (entirely) refuted.

 Well now, is it the import of the Disciples' Canon that there is no
permission for taking life, (even) depending on (certain)
circumstances?  Or is it not?  

If it is not, then there would be
no difference between the Individual Vehicle and Universal Vehicle
Canons with regard to whether taking life is prohibited or allowed.

If it is, then, as the import of the Universal Vehicle Canon is
indeed that, given certain (dire) necessities, taking of life is
permitted, there is an internal contradiction for the speaker (of
the Canons).

  If I say that, what answer do you have?  If you venture
that while as far as the Individual Vehicle disciple is concerned
there is never permission for taking life, there is no contradiction,
since the speaker's intention is that (only) given certain special
(cases of) Universal Vehicle (disciples) is there such permission,
(then you have answered your own question).

  Where then is the contradiction in there being (statements about) intrinsic
identifiability, considering the intellects of certain Universal
Vehicle class disciples who are not (yet) receptive to the full
explanation of the profound, and in there being (statements that
there is) no intrinsically identifiable status in anything, considering
those disciples who are receptive (and able) to understand the
full import of the profound?

 We cannot apply (this sort of intentional analysis) to statements
such as "Having killed father and mother," where although the
literal meaning is not the meaning of the expression, since that
is determined by the speaker's desire, namely (that one should
eliminate) existence and craving, since the speaker here wants
this sort of disciple to understand the actual meaning as explicitly
expressed (albeit symbolically).

  Therefore, our position is that
the non-definitiveness (of a teaching) is proven by showing a
(logical) refutation of its literal meaning, the explicit meaning
having necessarily been expressed, since no subject of the expression
is shown other than the literal one, and there must be some subject
of expression (in any even interpretable teaching).

  Therefore,
there are two kinds of cases, one where (a teaching) is both the
expressed meaning of the scriptural passage as well as the intention
of the speaker, and another where it is necessarily established as
the meaning of the scriptural passage, even when it is not the
intention of the speaker.

##### THE DISAGREEMENT BETWEEN THE (ELUCIDATION OF INTENTION) AND THE QUESTIONS OF MAITREYA

##### (CHAPTER OF THE TRANSCENDENT WISDOM EIGHTEEN THOUSAND)

 (Here, it is commonly objected that) if the Elucidation
of Intention presentation of the three natures is as explained
in the Idealist system, do we likewise accept the Questions of
Maitreya chapter?  Or do we not?  If we do, then, like the
Elucidation of Intention, it is not correct to accept the
Mother Scripture literally.

  If we do not, then (how do we
account for the fact that) the following passage--"Maitreya,
consider that imagined form as insubstantial.

  Consider that
constructed form as substantial, not because of its
independence, but because of the substantiality of construction.

Consider that ultimate form as neither substantial nor insubstantial,
but as derived from the ultimate."

 --agrees with the
Elucidation of Intention by mentioning the substantiality of
the relative and by proving the mere nominality of things from
form to Buddhahood with the three reasonings (given above)

such as "because there would be no cognition prior to the name,"
etc.?

 To explain:  Maitreya, wishing to learn how the bodhisattva practices
the transcendent wisdom, asked how he should learn (to understand)
things from forms to Buddhahood, and was answered that he should learn
them as being "mere names.
"

  (Maitreya) then asked (further)
about how to learn that forms, etc., were "mere names," since, as
names such as "form" are apprehended along with the things that serve
as their referents, "forms" etc. are not properly "mere names.
"  

If
there is no referent, a name is not suitably a "mere name"; since,
if the objective referent exists, the word "mere" excludes nothing,
and if it does not exist, neither does the name, since it is without
referential basis.

  (The Buddha) then answers that (names) from
"form" to "Buddhahood" are coincidentally designated upon their
referents, i.e., that nominal designation is coincidental.
  Since
"coincidental" here has the meaning of "artificial," it refutes the
intrinsic reality (of the referents or the names).


 If, as the Idealist would have it, this passage does not negate
the truth-status of forms, etc., but (merely) negates the truth-status
of "forms, etc." as nominally designated entities, then the intention
of the above statement that (all things) from form to Buddha are
mere names should be demonstrable (as meaning that) entities designated
by such as "this form, etc." are mere nominal designations, (which
is not so stated in the passage).

  In the subsequent passage where
(Maitreya) asks if forms etc. are non-existent with respect to any
nature, and the (Buddha) says he does not say that, (Maitreya) again
asks "then how is it?" and (the Buddha) replies that "They exist by
mundane terms and conventions, but not in the ultimate."
  
  Thus,
(if the Idealist interpretation were correct), then this statement
that (all things) from form to Buddha are equally non-existent in the
ultimate, and equally existent in the conventional would be wrong.

Therefore, it is mistaken to urge that this chapter elucidates the
interpretability of the Mother Scripture by showing the intention
of the (Scripture's) earlier statements that all things are ultimately
non-existent and conventionally existent.

 Therefore, the import (of the chapter) is that, since nominally
designated things are artificial, that is, established as existent in
conventional terms, there is no referent to which names are attached
which (itself) is not established as merely conventionally existent.

And since that is not to say that in general there is no phenomenal
basis for using names, the statement of the existence of that
(conventional referent) and the statement that (all things) are mere
nominal designations are not contradictory.

 Next, (Maitreya) asks how it is correct that "form" should be
coincidentally nominally designated, since the consideration "this
form" does not arise by virtue of seeing a manifestation of form
without (knowing) the name "form," but arises by virtue of the name.
(The Buddha) answers that it is correct for the thought "form" to
arise since form is established on strength of convention, existing
in that mode even before a name has been attached to it.
  
  (He) then
asks Maitreya himself if a cognition that thinks "form" with regard
to a phenomenon arises without depending on the name ("form").

(Maitreya) answers that such does not happen, and (the Buddha) states
that for that very reason "forms etc." are coincidental nominal
designations.

   This (passage) indicates that that reason is
the proof that forms etc. are established on strength of conventions,
and is not proof of the opposite, as (he) implies that if form had
intrinsically identifiable status, the thought "form" would have
to arise without requiring any designation of the name ("form"); just
as a sprout would grow without requiring any seed if it were
established by its intrinsic identity.

  (Further), the statement of
the coincidentality of designations of forms, etc., by the (further)
reasons of a single thing having many names and many things being
designable by one name, means that it is mistaken (to think)
that nominal conventions are used on strength of intrinsic
identifiability and are not just established coincidentally
on strength of conventions.

 When one uses these (three) reasons to prove something, it is not
at all required that they be used in the way they are used in the
Universal Vehicle Compendium.

  For, (Nagarjuna), in his Subtle
Weaving, uses the latter two (of the three) reasons to negate
the ultimate status (of phenomena):  "Furthermore, ultimate status
is not proven because (realistic cognition) is not possible, because
of the obvious fault of the confusion of multiple aspects of
expressions and their referents, and because of the indeterminacy
(of expressions with respect to their referents).
"

 (Returning to the Scripture), (Maitreya) asks if, when one
apprehends phenomena from "form" to "Buddha," it is not so that
one only perceives that reality of forms etc. which
consists of
nominal and conventional designations.

  (The Buddha queries in
turn then) that since there are phenomena which serve as referential
bases of nominal designations, is it not the case that forms,
etc., have intrinsically real status?  (Maitreya) responds that,
as for the reality of forms, etc., the referents of conventional
designations such as "forms, etc.," it is no more than mere mental
construction.

  (Finally the Buddha,) at that "mere construction"
statement, responds:  "Well then, what were you thinking when you
questioned as before?"

  This passage indicates that there is
no contradiction between the statement that phenomena which are
referential bases of names exist, although not as intrinsically
identifiable entities, and the statement that such are mere nominal
designations.

 Then (Maitreya) suggests that, if forms, etc., are merely names and
conventions, would not the reality of forms, etc., then be apprehended,
meaning thereby that it would be contradictory to say both the
above "it is mere designation" as well as "its reality is not
apprehended;" which means that it is not contradictory for the reality
of form, etc., to exist, since even one who advocates
"mere designation"
must accept (the relationship of) designation and referent.

  In answer,
(the Buddha counters, asking that) if (those things are) mere nominal
designations, do they have production and destruction, addictive
defilement and purification?  

(Maitreya) then answers that they do
not, and (Buddha finally) declares, "Well then, is the question
'If things are mere designations, wouldn't they have their own
reality?' appropriate?"

 Then, as explained above, they engage in the exchange beginning
"Well, are forms etc. totally non-existent with respect to any
nature?" indicating that the negations of reality, production,
destruction, addictive defilement, and purification are in terms
of the ultimate and that forms etc. exist conventionally.


Thus, since even mere designations (only exist) in terms of
convention, how can the mode of exposition (of this chapter) possibly
agree with that of the Elucidation of Intention?  

Even the
Brother-Masters, (Asanga and Vasubandhu), considered not that this
chapter revealed the interpretability of (the rest of) the Mother
Scripture, but that this chapter is the same (as the rest of
the Mother Scripture) since it teaches the ultimate non-existence
and conventional existence of all things, and hence, according to
the explanation of the Elucidation of Intention, it is not fit
to be literally accepted.

 (To understand how) this is not contradicted by the fact that
(this Scripture) states the relative (nature) to exist substantially,
one must first know the Scripture's mode of representing the three
realities.

  To explain, the Scripture identifies the imagined nature
(as follows):
Maitreya, this imaginative construction of a
form-reality founded on the name, concept, designation, and convention
"form" (ascribed) to the phenomena of the conditional process (is
the imagined reality, including all things) from imagined "form" to
imagined "Buddha-qualities.
"

 Here, "founded on" means "apprehending in form
the referent of the nominal designation.
"  

"Imaginative construction
of a form-reality" indicates that the imagined is the reality which is
imaginatively constructed, not (mere) imagination (itself).

 The Scripture goes on to identify the discriminatively constructed
reality (as follows):

The discriminatively constructed (relative) reality

is the articulation of those phenomena of conditional processes,

utilizing mental processes inherent in the nature of mere construction;

(it is) the names, concepts, designations, and conventions from "form,"
"sensation," "conception," "function," and "consciousness" up to
"Buddha-qualities".

  (It includes) (all things) from "discriminated
form" up to "discriminated Buddha-qualities.
"

 Here, "those phenomena" refers to the subjects of
expressions, and the mode of expressing them by utilizing
discriminative construction (is described by the passage from) "form"
etc.  By explaining the thus expressed "names etc." as the
"discriminatively constructed (relative) reality,"  (we can) understand
that the previously indicated subjects and mental constructions are
also the discriminated (relative reality), and thus (we understand
that it includes) both (the function of) discriminative construction
and the ground of discriminative construction.

 The Scripture then defines the ultimate reality (as follows):
(The ultimate reality is) the truth-limit,
Thatness, the objective selflessness and the sole realitylessness,
permanent and eternal, of discriminated form with respect to imagined
form, (including all things) from ultimate form to ultimate
Buddha-qualities.


 Here, "ultimate form" is the realitylessness of
discriminated form, objective selflessness, etc.  And since that
principle is selflessness and realitylessness of discriminated
form with respect to imagined form, the negated "self" or reality
is the imagined reality.

  "Permanent" etc. indicates emptiness, which
is ascertained at all times.

  This method (is the same as) the Centrist presentation of the three
natures, given by (Chandra) in the Introduction Commentary, where
(Chandra explains) that, just as a snake is a (mere) imaginative
construct in a rope, not (really) existing there, yet is not (a mere)
construct but is established in an actual snake, so intrinsic reality
is a (mere) imaginative construct in the created relativity of the
relative nature, since (Nagarjuna has defined) intrinsic reality as
non-artificial and non-relational, yet such (intrinsic reality) is
actual in the sphere of Buddhas, not being merely imaginatively
constructed, as one is called a "Buddha" who realizes the solitary
intrinsic reality, free of all contact with created things.

  Thus,
this way of presenting the three realities elucidates the inner gist
of the Scriptures.

  And thus the meaning of the Mother Scripture
should be understood as (Chandra explains) in the Introduction
Commentary.

 Here, the "discriminated" (reality) is taken as the relative reality
of all relative things from form to omniscience, and it is emphasized
as the chief (reality).

  And that reality explained as the imagined,
(consisting of) reality-imaginations from form to omniscience, is
(itself) taken as the ground, or intrinsic reality, whose existence
in the relative is (merely) imagined.

  Nevertheless, it is perfectly
established as the object of a Buddha's ultimate gnosis.
  
  
Furthermore,
the ultimate reality of the relative is its emptiness with respect
to the imagined, which is the relative existing ultimately, and that
very reality exists as the object of the Buddha's ultimate knowledge.
Thus, a single reality is presented as both imagined and also perfectly
established when related to different grounds.

  Therefore, although
there is no ultimate or superficial thing which is established as an
intrinsic reality endowed with intrinsic identifiability, still the
ultimate reality without the superficial reality is established as
that which is represented as intrinsic reality of the absolute.
Thus the question of existence and non-existence of intrinsic reality
must be subtly understood.


 As for the statement (that a Buddha) understands clearly "the
solitary intrinsic reality free of contact with created things," it
negates the (dualism of) "identified" and "identity" (inherent in)
the object of the direct realization of the ultimate reality; and
I have already explained the non-contradictoriness of this point.


 The (subsequent) exhortation of the Introduction Commentary to
think over whether the duality of subject and object is (merely)
imaginatively constructed in the relative, since apart from the
relative there are no subjects and objects, means that it is incorrect
(to maintain) that the subject-object-duality alone is the imagined,
since, there being no distinction between existence and non-existence
of subjective and objective, they both constitute the relative and
thus serve as the designative base of the imagined.


 Therefore, the "substantiality" mentioned in the Questions of
Maitreya statement of "substantial existence and non-existence" is
not the "substantial" of the pair "designative-substantial" employed
in other treatises (of the Idealists), nor is it the "substantial"
equated by the Centrists with intrinsically identifiable status;
but signifies mere existence.  

Thus, "substantial non-existence of
the imagined" intends the impossibility of (the imagined) existing
as the reality of the relative, and does not (impugn) the existence
of the imagined as object of names and signs, etc.  And, as for the
"substantial existence of the discriminated (reality)," the Scripture
itself states it to be substantially established through the
"substantial" existence of discriminative constructs (themselves),
and not through some independently arisen phenomenon.

  Since
"independent status" is just that which is explained in the treatises
of the Father and Son Masters as intrinsically identifiable status,
this (statement of "substantiality") is not the same as the statements
of other (interpretable) Scriptures that the relative is endowed with
intrinsic identifiability.

 "Substantial" existence established by the substantiality of
discriminative constructs is the kind of existence sustained by
the existence of discriminative construction, which means that it
is not an intrinsically identifiable existence.  Since among things
established by discriminative construction there are both those that
do exist conventionally and those that do not, this (kind of mentally
established existence) may not be likened to the discriminative
construction of a snake in a rope.  

(Finally), as to the statement
that the absolute reality is neither substantially existent nor
non-existent, it intends the above non-existence according to the
imagined and the existence as the intrinsic reality of the negation
of that (imagined).

 Interpreted in this way, this chapter determines with question and
answer the points liable to misinterpretation from the statements
in the Scripture's other chapters about the mere nominal
designativeness of all things.

  It thoroughly differentiates the
distinctions of existence and non-existence of the three realities,
and thus should be recognized as establishing the authority of the
previous expositions.

 Since this Questions of Maitreya chapter seems to be a major
source of error for those scholars who are liable to suspect that
within the Transcendent Wisdom Scripture, the path which is the
sole avenue of all the Victors of the three times, within that very
Scripture is (a chapter) which is determined to be interpretable
in meaning like the Elucidation of Intention, and since the great
Centrists do not seem to have elucidated the meaning of this very
(chapter) in great detail, I have submitted the question to a
detailed examination.

### CHAPTER VII

##### THE CHIEF REASON FOR NEGATION OF ULTIMATE STATUS

1.  DESCRIPTION OF THE CHIEF REASON

Which does this system take to be the chief reason negating
the ultimate status of things?

 (Chandrakirti) states, in the Introduction Commentary:
"(Nagarjuna) did not execute the analyses in the Treatise out of a
love for debate, but taught the facts in order to liberate (living
beings).
"
   All analytical reasonings in the Wisdom have
as their sole aim the attainment of liberation by living beings.

Living beings are chained in cyclic life by their habitual adherence
to personal and objective selves.
  And since the chief cause of
bondage is this habitual adherence to the two selves, in the person,
object for the arisal of the thought "I," and in the things which
(constitute) his process (of existence), those two are the chief
bases of rational negation of habitual selfhood.

  Therefore, (all)
reasonings are categorized as negating the two selves.

 In the passage in the Introduction Commentary where the
reasonings determining reality in the Introduction are categorized
as determining the two selflessnesses,
 (Chandra) states that the
reasonings refuting four-extreme-production are demonstrations of
objective selflessness.

  (He also) states that the Master (Nagarjuna),
in beginning (the Wisdom) with "not from self, not from
other etc.," demonstrated with reasoning only the equality of the
non-production of all things, from among the ten equalities stated
in the Ten Stages
 (to be contemplated) in entering the sixth
stage, thinking that the other (nine) equalities were easier to
demonstrate.  

Therefore, the chief reasoning proving the selflessness
of things is the reasoning negating four-extreme-production.

 Furthermore, this reasoning proving (selflessness) boils down to
the cutter of the whole trap of false views, the royal reason of
relativity itself.

  For, the very fact of the inter-relative
occurrence of inner things such as mental creations and outer things
such as sprouts dependent on causes and conditions such as
misknowledge and seeds (corroborates) the negations "their production
is empty with reference to any intrinsically identifiable intrinsic
reality" and "they are not produced from self, other, both, or
neither.
"  

As (Chandra) states in the Introduction:

Things will never be produced from self, other,
or both, or from a creator, or causelessly (randomly); 

thus,
they are  produced relatively.

  Thus, since things occur relatively
these constructs cannot (withstand) analysis, 

and hence this reason
of relativity cuts open the whole network of bad views.


 As for the chief reasoning negating personal self,
(Chandra) states in the Introduction:

While that (self) will never be established,

either ultimately or conventionally, via seven modes,

still, through social conventions without analysis,

it is designated depending on its components.


 Although no chariot is found when sought in
seven ways, as identical with its components, different from them,
possessing them, mutually dependent in two ways (with them), the mere
composite (of them), or as the structure of their composite, it still
is presented as designatively existent, designated depending on its
components.
  
  In the same way, the person is presented.

  (He
also) states
that very (reasoning) to be the method for the easy finding of the
view of the profound, and hence those reasonings should be
acknowledged as the chief reasonings negating personal self.

 (Chandra) also states in the Introduction:

"How could it exist, if not in these seven ways?"

The yogi finds no existence of this (self), and thereby easily
penetrates reality as well--so here its status should thus be
acknowledged.


 Since this (example of the chariot) is easier
to understand at first than the non-discovery of the person when
seeking in seven ways, as well as its designative status dependent
on its aggregates, such is the sequence in practice.  And this
(reasoning) also boils down to the reason of relativity, since the
import of the selflessness of the person is the non-discovery of any
person in those seven ways because of the fact of its (mere)
designation depending on the aggregates.

  Such being the case, the very
negation of self-production, etc., four (extremes) and of intrinsic
sameness or difference, etc., in seven (ways), by the reasons of
relative production and dependent designation should be upheld
as the principally significant of reasonings.

2.  THE PROCESS OF REFUTING INTRINSIC IDENTIFIABILITY THEREBY

 Well then, since this negation of intrinsically identifiable
status (of anything) even superficially by those reasons of
relativity appears to be the distinctive specialty of this system
in elucidating the intention of the Holy Ones, how do they execute
such an exceptional negation?
 As this is extremely crucial, let us explain it.
  This (exceptional
negation) is executed in the Central Way Introduction by three
reasonings given in the basic verses and one given in the commentary.

 The first of these (is called) "the consequence that the holy
equipoise would destroy phenomena," (and it runs as follows):  if
things had an intrinsically identifiable reality, when the yogi
realized directly the unreality of all things, his intuitive
knowledge would annihilate things such as forms and sensations,
since they should be apprehended (if they were real) yet they are
not.

  A thing that formerly exists and later does not is called
"destroyed," and (in this case) the cause of its destruction would be
taken to be that intuitive knowledge.  

Since it is irrational for
that (wisdom) to be a cause of destruction, intrinsically identifiable
production is inadmissible at all times.

  (Chandra states) in the
Introduction:  

"If things stood on intrinsic identifiability,

its repudiation would be their destruction 

and emptiness would be
the destructive cause.  

Such being irrational, things do not
exist (identifiably).
"

 Here one (Dogmaticist) might object that mere intrinsically
identifiable existence does not entail that intuitive wisdom
apprehend things, and, although ultimate existence does entail
such apprehension, he does not assert such (existence of things),
since intrinsically identifiable status is only conventional.

 Although this is a direct rebuttal, it cannot evade (Chandra's
consequence), as we will explain in the context of the next reasoning.

 (The second of the four exceptional reasonings is called) the
"consequence that conventional reality could withstand analysis,"
(and it runs as follows):  if things were intrinsically identifiable,
then if, for example, one were to analyze the objective referent of
the conventional designation "production"--"Is this 'produced' sprout
really the same as the seed?  Or really different?"--it is
necessary that the analytic (cognition) find (those things).

Otherwise, they would become established merely on the strength of
conventions since there would be no intrinsically identifiable
objective referents.

 However, when one analyzes (things) by investigating them in such
a way, one does not find any such thing as production apart from
that the nature of which is ultimate reality, where there is no
production and no cessation.

  Therefore, superficial things
(should) not be asserted to be objects discovered by such analysis.

(Chandra formulates this consequence) in the Introduction (as
follows):
When one analyzes these (mundane) things, they
are not found to stand anywhere short of that with ultimate nature.
Therefore, social conventional reality should not be analyzed.


 Here, as explained above, a certain (Dogmaticist)
claims (that this consequence does him) no damage, the essence of his
disagreement being his drawing a line between reasoning analytic of
ultimacy and
non-ultimacy and the method of analysis merely (seeking
referents of designations) explained above, since, although
(conventional reality) does withstand analysis by the (latter) type
of analysis, he never claimed that it withstands analysis by reasoning
analytic of the ultimacy or non-ultimacy (of things).

  This rebuttal
is the fundamental one, and is essentially the same (in thrust) as the
previous rebuttal (given to the first consequence).

 As for the reason why they cannot evade the damage of those
(consequences), it is -- as repeatedly explained above, and as given
in Chandra's statements in this context and in many others that
superficial existence is (equivalent to) social conventional
existence -- the very statement that whatever persons and things are
established by social conventions are only established without the
slightest analysis as to the mode of existence of the referents
of the conventions, and thus that which, on the contrary, is
established to exist analytically is ultimately existent.
  
  Therefore,
if (something) is intrinsically identifiably existent, it must of
necessity withstand analysis by rational cognition and must of
necessity be apprehended by the intuitive wisdom that directly
encounters the ultimate.
 (Again the Dogmaticist) objects that ultimate existence of something
is its existence on strength of its own actual condition, not merely
established on strength of its appearance in non-defective cognitions
such as sense-cognitions, and hence social conventional existence
is not that established on strength of verbal conventions, but is
existence on the strength of appearance in non-defective cognition,
while still not being existence on the strength of a thing's own
objective condition.

 (We answer that) if such were the case, it would contradict the
(scriptural) statement that all things are mere names, signs, and
designations, and the statement that "(things) exist by social
conventions and usages, and not in the ultimate sense."  (For,)
if there were some object found by analysis of the mode of existence
of the referents of conventional designations, what would the word
"merely" (in the former statement) exclude?  And how could it be
correct to say (in the latter statement) "it exists by social
conventions," etc.?  (And here finally), while being completely
out of touch with the way in which a common person accepts the
referents of conventional designations, if one nevertheless says
"(such and such) exists as a social convention," this is no more
than (empty) talk, since he does not (in fact) accept the meaning.

 The sevenfold analysis, (which proves) the impossibility of
establishing as person any object found by analysis seeking the
referent of the convention "person," and the reasonings such as
the negation of production from other even conventionally, (which
prove) the impossibility of establishing as production, etc., any
objects found by analysis seeking the referents of conventions
for things such as "production" -- these should be understood
from the detailed examinations (I have given them) elsewhere.

 Thus, there is no difference between the conventions for persons
and things, such as "I saw" and "the sprout grows," and the conventions
(of philosophy) such as "my substantial self saw" and "the sprout
grows from a substantially different seed," in the sense that
investigation of the mode of existence of the referents of (both
types of) conventions finds nothing (ultimately).

  Nevertheless,
there is an extremely great difference (between them) with regard
to whether or not their existence corresponding to their designations
is faulted by other (conventional) validating cognitions; the
former pair
(of conventions) being conventionally existent, the latter pair
not being existent even conventionally.

  And further, this (point)
depends on the thorough discrimination of the difference between (a
thing's) being faulted by rational cognition and its being unable
to withstand analysis, as well as the extremely great difference
between rational cognition's not finding the existence (of something)
and its seeing the non-existence (of something).
  
  But I have already
explained these extensively elsewhere.

 Here, someone who has not accomplished the analysis of fine
discrimination between the above (apparently similar types of
conventions) yet negates ultimate status by a few likely reasons,
and maintains the existence of superficial things by means of a few
erroneous cognitions, might think that (those conventions) can be
established merely by their existence according to erroneous cognition,
since their referents merely exist according to error.

  This (kind of
attitude) ends up (as the position that) if (the propositions that)
"happiness and suffering arise from the Creator and from Nature, etc."
and "happiness and suffering arise from good and evil actions" are
right, they are both equally right, and if wrong, are both equally
wrong; since analytic cognition will not find (the referent of) even
the latter when analyzing it as above, and even the former exists
according to erroneous (cognition).
  
  If such were the case, then
(Chandra's statements) in the Introduction:  "This (self) is
irrational even as the ground of the 'I'-process, nor do we
assent even to its superficial existence;"
 and also, "What
the fundamentalists, disturbed by sleep of ignorance, imagine
respectively (as real) each in their own (theory), and what (people)
imagine in illusions and mirages--these are just what do not exist,
even conventionally;"
 (i.e., to the effect that) the imaginative
constructions of the special theories of our own and others' schools
and the objects such as horses and elephants apprehended in illusions
or water apprehended in mirages are non-existent even
superficially; both
would become incorrect.

  For, (unless they existed superficially)
not even erroneous cognitions could apprehend them; since they
do exist according to erroneous cognitions, they would become
conventionally existent; and because the rational negations such
as "production from self or other is not established even
conventionally" would become incapable of refuting anything at
all.


 Here, (the above holder of the confused attitude about the status
of conventions) cannot claim immunity (from the unacceptable
consequences of his position) by asserting that he establishes
superficial existence, not as those errors which belong to
unreflective living beings from beginningless time, but merely as
existence according to the error derived from the beginningless
continuum of failure to analyze (the nature of reality).

For, if
such were the case (i.e., that superficial existence is constituted
by the specific error of lack of analysis), then even the conceptual
objects of notions of permanence that hold prior and posterior as
identical, (as well as the objects) of unconscious self-habits
that adhere to the intrinsic identifiability of persons and things,
would become conventionally existent.

 Therefore, granting that (something's) conventional existence
precludes its discovery by rational cognition investigating its
mode of existence, still it is definitely necessary that it not
be refuted by validating rational cognition, and it is also necessary
that it not be faulted by any other conventional validating cognition,
because it is necessary that (a thing's) conventional existence be
established by validating cognition.

 Here, if one objects that such (a position) contradicts (the
doctrine that) conventionally existent things are merely established
on the strength of verbal conventions, (we respond that) this does
not fault (our position).

  The word "merely" in the expression
"superficially existent things such as persons are merely
established on the strength of verbal conventions" excludes (the
possibility that) the person is not established on the strength
of verbal conventions, and does not exclude (the possibility that)
the person is also established by validating cognition; nor does it
give any indication that everything established on the strength
of verbal conventions is (in fact) superficially existent.

 If you wonder what sort of non-conventional status of (things) is
excluded (by the above expression, we can explain that) if the
referent designated by the convention "person" were to have
intrinsically identifiable status, this would entail its having an
existence by virtue of its own intrinsic reality and would not
allow it to have existence (merely) by virtue of the subjective
convention ("person").

  (Thus,) this  is the kind of (non-conventional
status, i.e., intrinsically identifiable status) that is ruled out
(by "merely").

  Although such a kind (of non-conventional status)
is negated by rational cognition, the (conventional) existence of
the referents of conventional expressions such as "Yajna sees" is
(nonetheless) established, since, if a conventional expression
had no referent (at all), it would be faulted (even) by conventional
validating cognition.

  And, in the context of a verbal convention
and its referent, when a referent is found not to exist by its own
intrinsic reality, its existence on the strength of convention
is automatically established.

  Therefore, if one analyzes the mode
of existence of the ultimate reality, it finally ends up as just
the same.  And so we assert that its existence is also established
on the strength of convention, although we do not assert that the
ultimate reality is established by conventional validating cognition.

Furthermore, we say that the ultimate reality exists according to
conventional cognition because of the fact that the notion of the
existence of the ultimate is absent from the habit-pattern of
rational cognition, which is not the same as saying that (ultimate
reality) is established by that (conventional validating cognition).

 Buddhapalita also explains that the Victor spoke of production,
etc., on the strength of conventions and that "production, etc.,"
were established as mere expressions.

  Whereas the Dogmaticists
assert that the non-defective cognition that establishes conventional
existence is non-erroneous with regard to the intrinsically
identifiable thing that is its perceptual or conceptual object,
in this (Dialecticist system) there are a great many things that
can be established as objective by (cognitions) erroneous about
their apparent objects.

  Hence there is a great difference in
(the determination of what is) defective and non-defective
in the non-defective cognitions of these two (systems).

 Although (Chandra) calls this sort of existence on strength of
convention "designative existence,"  it is definitely not the sort
of designative existence where something is designated in the absence
of any phenomenon.

  Thus, all (things) such as Buddhas and living
beings as defined, and bondage and liberation as defined, are viable
in this (interpretation of conventional existence), and are not at
all viable in any other system.

  (Finally), in the face of the
elucidation of this very fact by the two masters (Buddhapalita
and Chandrakirti) as the ultimate intention of the Holy Father and
Son, if one can see no ground for establishing (all empirical)
systems with (all their) attributes, it is the result of the
predominance of the ingrained habit of associating all normal
causalities, etc., with intrinsically identifiable status.

  And
since it (means that) still the import of relativity has not yet
dawned as the import of emptiness by intrinsic reality, you should
realize that you are standing at the point of greatest resistance
to this system.

 (The third of the four exceptional reasonings is called) "the
consequence of the non-negation of ultimate production," (and it
runs as follows):  if things' intrinsically identifiable status
is not negated by the negation through analysis of whether production
is from self or other, then negation of ultimate status also will
not be accomplished through such analysis.

  Since that is irrational,
intrinsically identifiable status can also be negated conventionally.

By the essential point that intrinsic identifiability necessarily
entails ultimacy, the reasonings negating ultimate production also
negate conventional intrinsic identifiability.

  Therefore,
intrinsically identifiable production does not exist in either
of the two realities, as (Chandra) states in the Introduction:
The very reasons (proving) the irrationality
of self- and other-production in the ultimate sense also (prove)
their irrationality in the conventional reality--so whereby will
your production come to pass?

 (The fourth of the four exceptional reasonings
is called) (the consequence of) "the wrongness of the (scriptural)
statement that things are empty by intrinsic reality.

" (Chandra)
in comment on the first (exceptional) reasoning in the Introduction
 cites the Kashyapa Chapter to prove emptiness with respect
to intrinsic identifiability:

Kashyapa, furthermore, the central way is the

genuine insight into things; 

it does not make things empty by means of emptiness, 

but (realizes that) the very things themselves are emptiness.

likewise it does not make things signless, wishless,
performanceless, non-produced, and non-occurrent by means of
signlessness.

and non-occurrence, (but realizes that) the very
things themselves are signlessness.

the very things themselves are non-occurrence...


 (Chandra) also explains that this scriptural
reference teaches the incorrectness of the (interpretation of)
emptiness by the Idealist system.

  (Thus,) if things had an
intrinsically identifiable reality, they would not be empty in
their own nature, and "the very things themselves are emptiness"
would be wrong.

  And if existence by a thing's own intrinsic reality
were not refuted, then it would be necessary to demonstrate emptiness
through an emptiness with respect to something else, which contradicts
"it does not make things empty because of emptiness.
"  

In short,
(intrinsic identifiability of things) would mean that there is no
self-emptiness which is emptiness by a thing's own nature.  Therefore,
if one does not assent to the emptiness of things with respect to
the intrinsic reality which is intrinsic identifiability, though one
may call it "self-emptiness," it does not get beyond "other-emptiness,"


and (Chandra means that) the Idealist doctrine that the relative is
free of substantial subject-object-dichotomy does not negate (intrinsic
identifiability) by taking the import of the relative to be intrinsic
realitylessness.

 While (the various positions on the subtle objective selflessness)
are similar insofar as they are modes of emptiness where the
negation-ground does not exist as actuality of the negatee, and where
that ground is empty with respect to the negatee, (only) the emptiness
(of things) with respect to intrinsic identifiability means (their)
emptiness in (their) own right, all other modes of emptiness not
being emptiness (of things) in themselves.

  The reason is that, with
the former type of emptiness, as long as there is no loss of
concentration on the previously attained establishment by validating
cognition, it is impossible for reifications to occur which, under
the influence of theories, hold that ground as truly existent or
existent in a way tantamount to that.

  Whereas, even when the latter
(Idealist and Dogmaticist systems) do not lose the establishment
by validating cognition of their objectives, this does not prevent
reifications (holding) theoretically to (existence in) truth or
(in something with) the meaning of truth.


3. CONSIDERATION OF WHETHER THERE IS A PROBANDUM IN THE NEGATION "INTRINSIC REALITYLESSNESS"
 
 Here, one may wonder, are the reasons merely negating
intrinsic reality in persons and things, when they assert that
(it is) "not established?"  Or do the reasons (actually) prove
intrinsic realitylessness?
 In this regard, since it is first of all necessary to understand
the definitions of the two kinds of negation, let us explain them.

When a negation is verbally expressed, it either excludes its
negatee explicitly in words or else may be understood as functioning
effectively to negate its negatee when it dawns in the cognition
(through its implications).

 An example of the first mode is
"selflessness," and of the second is "ultimate reality," which,
although its excluding of negatee is not verbally explicit, functions
effectively to exclude mental fabrications when its import dawns
(in the mind).

  Thus (negation) is what is understood when a negatee
is directly excluded.

 Now the first of the two (kinds of either implicit or explicit
negation) is choice negation, which commits itself to something else
when it directly excludes its negatee.  As (Bhavaviveka) states
in the Blaze of Argument, "choice negation negates the reality
of something and thereby establishes the reality of something else
similar to it.

  For example, the negation 'this (man) is not a
brahmin' establishes that (the man) is of a lower class than the
brahmin class, yet is similar to a brahmin by virtue of his learning,
ascetic achievements, and so forth.
"   

Exclusion negation,
(the second kind), does not imply anything else when it directly
excludes its negatee.  As (Bhavaviveka) explains in the Blaze
of Argument, "Exclusion negation does no more than negate just
the reality of something, not establishing anything other but
similar.

  For example, the expression 'A brahmin should not drink
beer!' only negates just that, and does not indicate that he does
or does not drink any other kind of drink.
"
  
  In these passages,
(Bhavaviveka) uses "establishes" and "does not establish"
interchangeably with "implies" and "does not imply," or else
(exclusion negation would be presented as) not even negating its
negatee.

 Here, the difference between these two (types) is not that they
negate using the words "is not" and "exists not," respectively;
because both Chandra and Bhavya explain "it is not from self" as
an exclusion negation, and one must understand "Boundless Life"
(Amitayuh) as a choice negation.

  Thus, for negation (to take
place), it is not sufficient to exclude a negatee with regard to
something by negating all other things (in general) as being it,
but it is necessary that (the negation) take effect with the mode
of exclusion (of the negatee) by one's verbal expression or with
the mode of direct exclusion of the negatee in one's conceptual
cognition.

 (In this regard) there are some who maintain that, while such
expressions as "selflessness" are exclusion negations (in general),
they are no longer such when put together with an object, as in
"selflessness in persons" etc., and others assert that there is no
exclusion negation together with an object, since then it implies
something else as well.

  These are quite wrong, because while the
particulars of the two types of negation are set forth in other
treatises just as explained above, such expressions as "brahmins
should not drink beer!" retain the character of exclusion negation
even though they are conjoined with an object, and because
(in such as that same expression) the object such as "brahmin" is
the basis for judging whether or not something else is implied
by the exclusion of the negatee, and is not (itself) the other
thing implied.

 There are four modes of implying something else (in a negation),
implicitly, explicitly, both together, and by context, as
(Avalokitavrata) cites in the Wisdom Lamp Commentary:  

"Choice
negation (implies) other things showing them implicitly, explicitly
establishing them, through both modes, and not by its own expression;
the other (type of negation) is different.
"

   Here, an example
of implicit (choice negation) is "Yajna is fat and does not eat
by day.

"  An example of explicit establishment of something else
is "It exists without being produced from itself," since exclusion
of the negatee and establishment of another fact are contained
in the same expression.
  
  An example of (choice negation through)
both modes, where explicit and implicit implications are both
in the expression, is "Fat Yajna does not waste away without eating
by day.
"  

And an example of (choice negation) not indicated in the
expression (itself) is the statement "this is not a brahmin"
made in the context where one knows for certain that a person is
either a brahmin or a warrior but not which of the two.

  If any
of these four modes of implication is found, (a negation is) a
choice negation, and any other (negation) which does not imply
any other thing is an exclusion negation.

 Now, certain former (scholars) asserted that the Centrists use
reasons and syllogisms for negating intrinsic reality, but not for
proving intrinsic realitylessness.

  This in incorrect, because
genuine reasons without probanda and inferential validating
cognitions without objects are impossible.

 (Still) others maintain that the Dogmaticists have reasons and
syllogisms for proving selflessness, but Dialecticists do not,
since (Chandrakirti) explained, in the Lucid Exposition, that
"We do not prove that this does not exist, but do refute the
absolutistic constructions of others.

  Likewise, we do not prove
the existence of this (conventional reality), but refute the
nihilistic constructions of others, since we assert the establishment
of the central way by clearing away the two extremisms.
"

(They also maintain) that consequences merely function to negate
the premises of others,
 and that, as in the Introduction,
"the wise exclaim that the fruit of philosophical analysis is the
elimination of imaginative constructions"
; and that therefore
(the Dialecticists) merely refute the systems of others and do not
prove the non-existence of intrinsic reality.


 Explanation of only that necessary for mere exclusion of the negatee
is not one of the Dialecticist distinctive specialities, because
even (Bhavaviveka) explains, in the Blaze of Argument, that
"(This) does no more than merely negate, as earth, etc., are not
actually elements ultimately, and does not prove that they are actually
anything else or that they are actually non-existent.
"

Therefore, the word "merely" in the statements that negation of
intrinsic identifiability merely excludes the negatee and merely
gets rid of false constructions indicates that (these statements)
are exclusion negations, refuting the possibility of their being
choice negations by ruling out their implying anything else, not
merely negating their negatees within their logical scope; because,
as explained above, (exclusion negation) merely excludes its negatee
without establishing anything else.

 An example (of exclusion negation) is the expression "there is no
smoke in the lake," which merely excludes the presence of smoke in
the lake without indicating (the existence of) anything else.  However,
it does not (thereby) fail to show that the lake is free of smoke,
nor does the corresponding cognition fail to ascertain the
smokelessness of the lake.  

Likewise, the expression "there is no
intrinsic reality in the sprout" merely rules out any intrinsic
reality in the sprout, but why should that preclude the expression's
expressing and the cognition's ascertaining the intrinsic
realitylessness of the sprout?  

Therefore, the words express the
absence of the smoke in the lake in their very exclusion (of it)
and the cognition ascertains the absence of the smoke in its very
exclusion (of it from the lake); because the exclusion of the negatee
and the determination of the negation are (mutually indispensable),
the lack of either one entailing the lack of the other.

  In the same
way, the scriptural references teaching intrinsic realitylessness
express intrinsic realitylessness in their actual negation of intrinsic
reality, the rational cognition negative of intrinsic reality cognizes
intrinsic realitylessness in its actual negation of intrinsic reality,
and the reason negative of intrinsic reality proves intrinsic
realitylessness in its actual negation of intrinsic reality.

  These
(facts) must be accepted, and one must not assert that the scriptural
references have no subject, the cognition has no object, and the
reason has no probandum.

 Therefore, it does not seem to be correct to assert, with regard
either to the Centrist, or even to the Logician, that reason merely
negates intrinsic reality and does not prove intrinsic realitylessness.

When it is said that the statement "earth is not ultimately the
actuality of the element" merely accomplishes the negation of its
being the actuality of the element ultimately, it means that that
exclusion negation proves that probandum, and the statement "it
does not prove that it is actually non-existent" does not mean that
(the statement) does not prove that it does not exist as an element
ultimately, but means that it does not prove there to be any reality
of non-existence other than a pure negation.

  Therefore, granted that
it is valid to inquire  whether something else is established
other than mere exclusion of a negatee, how can it be cogent to
inquire, having assented to the exclusion of a negatee,  whether
reason, word, and cognition have taken the negation as their
object?

 Here one might object that if the reason that rules out intrinsically
real existence also proves intrinsic realitylessness, how is this
reconciled with the Holy (Nagarjuna's) statement?  "This negates
existence itself, and does not embrace non-existence itself; just like
saying 'it is not black' is not to say 'it is white.'"

 This means that just as, for example, to say "this is not black"
when you want to show the mere absence of black, is a mere negation
of black and is not an indication of something else such as
"this is white," so when you assert that such as sprouts are
ultimately intrinsically realityless, you are proving merely the
negation of their ultimate, intrinsically real existence, and are not
proving the existence of any truthlessness apart from that.

(Bhavaviveka) in the Wisdom Lamp and (Avalokitavrata) in the
commentary explain (this verse of Nagarjuna's) as meaning that
the proof (of realitylessness) is not a choice negation, but is an
exclusion negation, as (Avalokitavrata) states that "this can be
understood from the example, since he does not say that 'it is not
black' fails to show that the thing is not black, but that it
does not show that it is white.

"(Incidentally,) Avalokitavrata
states that "this reference comes from the Investigation of the
World."

 The way in which confusion arises here may be expressed as follows:
"that ultimate non-production of the sprout must be proven to be
the case by rational cognition; hence, when the sprout is proven to
be without ultimate production, the existence of ultimate
non-production becomes the probandum, since the inference proves
that fact.

" 

I am going to explain how rational cognition does not
prove the existence of intrinsic realitylessness in my commentary
on the Wisdom.


 If we realize that the probandum is the exclusion negation (itself),
what we prove is the mere exclusion of ultimate production, and we
understand that we do not prove anything else such as the existence
of ultimate non-production.

 In regard to (Chandra's) statement in the Lucid Exposition, "we
refute what others imagine exists, and do not prove any
non-existence,"
 an example of a notion to refute is (that of)
utter non-existence, and it is refuted as follows:  "Ultimate
productionlessness is not to be held as truly existent;" and an
example of not proving any absolute existence is (simply) not to
prove the existence of ultimate production.
  Therefore, one can negate
both the truth-status of the sprout and the truth-status of the
truthlessness, since it is not the case that the exclusion of one
determines the other, but one cannot negate both the truth-status
of the sprout and the truthlessness of the sprout, since necessarily
the exclusion of the one is the determination of the other.

 (Nagarjuna)
clearly states in the Rebuttal of Objections:  "If it were the
case that the realityless (words) themselves were to eliminate
some realitylessness, when intrinsic realitylessness was done away
with, intrinsic reality would actually be established.


 Thus, if realityless words were to negate the intrinsic
realitylessness of things, then things would become in fact
intrinsically really existent.

  Similarly, ultimate existence and
ultimate non-existence cannot both be negated.
  However, ultimate
existence and ultimate existence of non-existence can both be
negated.

 In this regard, the (Buddhist) Realists cannot negate truth-status
in both (negation and negatee), since they assert that if the negatee
is untrue its negation is true, and if the negation is untrue its
negatee is true.  (On the other hand), the Centrists, having solidly
established with scripture and reason the definitive meaning, the
inconceivable, profound central path of abandonment of both those
extremes (of absolutism and nihilism), succeed in spreading out in
all directions the essence of the Doctrine of the Victor!

 Now, the following question may be (fairly) put:  "Since there seem
to be a multitude of approaches by which the two Great Champions
of Philosophy proceeded to differentiate between the interpretable
meaning and the definitive meaning of the Scriptures and by which
the lordly sages specifically elucidated the intimate intention
(of those Champions), which master of elucidation of the intimate
intentions
of those two (Champions) do you (Dialecticists) follow?  You must
(at last) proclaim which interpretation of definitive meaning you
profess to be the conclusive ultimate.

I revere from the depths of my heart

All the excellent elucidations of these,

The Ornaments of the Sages of this world.

Yet when one's eye of intellect is opened wide,

As a night-lily garden bursts in blooms,

By the white light shining from Chandra's moon,

And Buddhapalita's appointed path is seen

Who is there who would not hold supreme

The most excellent system of Nagarjuna?

Such is my answer!


 This way (I have explained above) should be understood to be the
path of the determination of the ultimate reality (revealed) in all
the Scriptures, esoteric as well as exoteric, since there is a grave
mistake (in thinking) that, while the systems of the two
(philosophical) Champions for determining the ultimate reality by
distinguishing the interpretable and the definitive among Scriptures
are evidently prevalent in the context of the Transcendence Vehicle,
the great Siddhas and the Pandits who elucidated the Scriptures of
the Tantric Vehicle had a third alternative (system) for determining
ultimate reality.

 And it is for this reason that I saw that seeking reality without
relying on the way of the Champions with their two systems is like
a blind man's running guideless through a wilderness and that the
previous accounts of ultimate reality by the mere dogmatists, who
stand on a few scriptural phrases distinguishing interpretable and
definitive, do not investigate thoroughly the treatises, and do not,
in particular, understand the subtle points of (the Champions')
reasonings; their accounts  are essentially mere verbiage.  

I then
became
dissatisfied with having only a rough idea of many of the (deeper)
points of meaning, and so made a comprehensive inquiry into the
precise and general keys of those reasonings which the Champions
have given us as eyes for looking upon the Scriptures.

  Having done
so, I composed this account of the Essence of Eloquence
for the sake of those of subtle philosophical discernment who,
unleashing mighty waves of efforts to determine the magnificence,
the profundity, and that more profound than the profundity of the
Scriptures, have taken to heart the practical attainment of what
they know, and earnestly desire that the Doctrine of the Victor
may long be with us!

He embodies the essence of the Doctrine,

The profound thought of the Victor,

As revealed by the Scripture of the Profound.


He has vast erudition in the many treatises

Of the two supreme philosophical systems

Among the methodologies of the Sage.

With his (wisdom) from analysis of their meanings

He rightly has considered analytically

The reasonings that captivate the discriminating.


He is celebrated as the "Sweet-Voiced" Manjughosha!

The garland of his fame spreads everywhere!

At the feet of that Omnipresent Lord --

Through my fiercely intense, unbroken faith,

And my reverent attendance (on his Presence)

In the lotus of my heart,

That philosopher who sees the truth of the Scriptures

Accomplished the writing of this wonderful account! 39


What other (treatise) thus explains

The meaning of the Scriptures

Of that Great Treasury of True Eloquence,

In such accord with the two systems of elucidation

Of Nagarjuna and Asanga, chief bulls among philosophers?

Having properly investigated the actuality

Of the spheres of the profound and the magnificent,

So hard to measure even by those Buddha-Sons

Skilled in sciences and long engaged in awesome deeds,

The great banquet of pure meditation, wisdom,

And morality delights and satisfies the mind.

Sometimes one swells with joy of faith in the Victors,

Sometimes one remembers the kindness of the Champions.

Other times, reverence for the wise spiritual teacher,

Heartfelt compassion for the distressed living beings,

Desire for the long endurance of the Precious Doctrine

All these grow as if in mutual competition.

And then, when (one feels) the magic of the path

Of the philosophy which gives success in one's quest

Of the so long desired Place, so hard to realize:

"Kyema!  How wonderful!"

Though one is all alone,

Such cries of joy burst forth!

Such a one was often lauded

By the Moon of philosophers with wreaths of praise,

As "Finder of Definitive Meaning"

"Scion of the Buddha-race!"

He stands foremost among the morally pure,

A meditator of wisdom supreme.

The geniuses who wish to win the Victor's praise

Should immerse themselves in this exposition

And purify their eyes of intellect

By means of the path of philosophy.

By whatever merit I may have gathered

By this effort in the pioneering

Champions' Way of the two systems,

May the Victor's Holy Dharma be long upheld

Just as it was by Nagarjuna and Asanga!

Thereby, just as the deeds of the wise Buddha-Sons

Samantabhadra and Manjughosha,

Give pleasure to the Victors,

Even so, may all my deeds

Be like great waves of goodness!

This Essence of Eloquence, which clarifies the
distinctions between the interpretable meaning and the definitive
meaning of the Scriptures, by differentiating the two systems of the
Champions of Philosophy, the system of "Mind-Only" of the Great
Saint Asanga, and the system of realitylessness of the Savior
Nagarjuna, was composed (in 1407) by the illustrious Easterner
Tsong Khapa bLo-bzang Grags-pa, a Bhikshu of the Shakya Order,
a scholar, and a philosopher.

  The scribe was the Shramanera sDom-brtson bSod-nams bLo-gros.

### OM!  All is well!
