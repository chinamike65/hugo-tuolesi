Attributed to Sengcan, Third Chinese Patriarch of Zen Buddhism (around 600 AD)
Translated by Bruce R. Linnell, PhD (2011)

A comment on the title : due to the nature of Chinese, the title could mean any of the following : “Belief in (the) Mind”, “The Believing Mind”, “Trust in (the) Mind”, “Trusting Mind”, “True Mind”, “Truthful Mind”, “Faith in (the) Mind”, or “Faithful Mind”, and indeed many of these have been used by other translators (most often “Faith in Mind”). I chose “True Mind” because the entire inscription discusses how to get back to the original Buddha nature we all have (but have forgotten), and the phrase “true mind” (in English, not these particular Chinese symbols) is often used synonymously with this Buddha nature, Buddha mind, True Nature, Original Nature, etc.


My goals were to include every Chinese symbol in the English sentence, using an exact translation of each symbol, and with minimal additional words and paraphrasing. This results in sentences which are sometimes stilted in English, but hopefully provides a more literal translation. Interpreted meanings are as close to the exact meaning as possible. Exceptions to these guidelines are marked with footnotes.

| **Term** | **Notes** |
|----------|---------------|
|Being | existence |
|Emptiness | negation of the belief in Being and non-Being|
|Awake, wise | enlightened |
|Foolish | not awake; unenlightened |
|Heart/mind | the Chinese symbol means both “heart” and “mind”; it seems misleading to use one or the other |
|Suchness | that which is constant and genuine; the true nature of things; reality-as-it-is; things just as they are |
|The Way, this wisdom | Buddha's way – the four noble truths, eightfold path, etc. |
|Entanglements | sensory pleasures, preferences, desires, aversions, love, hate, etc. (literally “conditions”) |
|Naturally, spontaneously | done by itself, that which is so of itself, done on its own, happens without forcing it |
|Cease to be, rejected, forgotten, eliminated, fade away | leave your awareness, no longer influence you |
|Things | the external world; objects, people, creatures, events

A : literally, “only blocked in both sides”

B : literally, “turn to non-agreement”

C : literally, “nowhere will be blocked”

D : I believe what is meant by this symbol (“illumination”) is the Light of the Buddha, enlightenment, etc.; however, this is the only interpretation that is my personal opinion, and has no support from any other sources

E : the literal translations, “subject” and “object”, refer respectively to the mind and the things it perceives

F : I believe this line (literally, “one moment eternity”) refers to the “sudden vs. gradual” debate on whether enlightenment can happen quickly, or can only be achieved after many years (some say many lifetimes) of practice
